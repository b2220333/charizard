especially on moderate where the attacks are constant . 
i put this on my hair and flat ironed it and my hair looked drier than sand paper . 
since their price is three times that they are about the worst value in headphones . 
just had to give it the personal touch . 
i cannot find patterns to solve the problem . 
i had to add a comment after reading the other reviews . 
i have waited over a year for this ,  and now ,  i am disapointed . 
i received the memorex num_extend as a father s day present . 
one of mine actually started leaking today and it is only a couple years old . 
i just ordered some and can t wait to be tan ! good luck !  . 
i thought that this would be a good filler in between other games ,  but it s just horrible . 
but with the last two orders she absolutely refused to touch it . 
as anyone that truly suffers from migraines knows ,  it can be very difficult to find any type of remedy . 
i don t particularly care for the smell either . 
i called the support number ,  and the support representative dutifully ran down her checklist . 
i tried three of them ,  on three machines . 
by this definition ,  all rechargeable batteries would be  solar  . 
i got one of these around num_num months ago and now it is not working . 
the cuispro grater is poor quality and poor design . 
some things are great values ,  others are cheap . 
on the other hand ,  this candy tastes absolutely repulsive . 
it might just be a fluke ,  but be warned that this might be a problem . 
i had very bad acne once upon a time and would break out underneath my eyebrows . 
i can only imagine that the nocturne engine is  inexpensive  to license . 
the motor burned out on that one in no time . 
voice coil burned up with a num_num watt bridged kenwood amp . 
i ordinarily have between a half bar and num_num bars of signal at my location . 
for me ,  this was a waste of a lot of money for something my dog hates . 
they are significantly better than anything out there . 
directions say to interrupt your computer from automatically finding and installing a driver ,  and to use the included cd . 
when i put it on ,  it fit so wrong . 
it tastes  raw  if you eat this without toasting them . 
i would say that jarrows works ,  and that now does not ,  at least for me . 
i ve tried cleaning it and manually adjusting the tracking ,  to no avail . 
nyx has a very similar product for a fraction of the cost . 
do yourself a favor and try something else . 
the seiko watch on the other hand is a great self winding watch . 
i ll try and not repeat what others have said . 
then the toy came in the mail from amazon . 
a game that will give people the much needed time and patience to put a move on their opponent . 
i cook every day and need a sturdy utensil . 
for a small investment ,  sunscreens may offer the possibility of sun burn ,  pain ,  cancer ,  medical bills ,  pain killers ,  etc . 
on the brush it looks super bright but once i placed it on my lashed you couldn t see anything . 
the worst part is the grate .  .  . not sure what else to call it . 
i did notice build up and that my scalp felt  heated  while applying . 
for instance ,  let s say you start a tournament with liu kang and you have the game on easy mode . 
the noodles have that slimy ,  clumpy appearance that many microwavable noodle products suffer from . 
the instructions says you have to use one hand and place the luggage on the side . 
i needed replacement soles for my uggs but these did not work . 
these are very attractive little  mittens  for your cast iron handles . 
should ve taken heed from the previous reviews but i really wanted to make this work for an event . 
it doesn t give much air and all the air you get you need to be close to feel . 
i thought danskin was a better brand ,  but maybe the design is intentional . 
leaves tons of air pockets you can t get out ,  and edges you can t get to stay out . 
i ll wait until someone comes out with one that is both thin and durable . 
when we got ours ,  the latest firmware was already months old ,  and they haven t updated it since . 
certainly i ve bought other brands ,  and i hadn t bought a bali in a while . 
my inkjet is not postscript ,  so i have to return this . 
my puppy wouldn t go near it so to me it was a waste of money . 
the audio is pretty mundane with japanese audio tracks to cover the horrible english voice actresses . 
then you ll notice the acai benefits ,  if you didn t feel them before . 
most important to me .  .  . all the blocks with the pic of an elephant are misspelled and read  elerhant  . 
i m sure it would have been great had it worked . 
here on amazon ,  this was too expensive for this . 
so when i bought my new sig sauer num_num tac ops i ordered a forbus holster . 
more of a shovel ,  than a rake imo . 
this caused the water to not be able to go up the straw . 
they re great looking cases but ours lasted less than num_num months . 
i m surprised no one has sued the company for manufacturing this awkward ,  uncomfortable ,  dangerous product . 
the seams fell apart on the thumbs ,  also down the sides . 
worse than not having anything under my eye shadows . 
they make much more reliable mice and i never had a problem with them . 
this was a toy purchased for my boston terrier puppy . 
this was a bad purchase ,  after using a month for water ,  something grew on the stainless inside wall . 
when i was incarcerated in a mexican prison ,  this was the only drink in the joint . 
when you start doing heavy squats ,  deadlifts ,  rack pulls ,  and overhead presses ,  you realize the flaws in this belt . 
the kit has a disappearing scarf trick that uses a magic bag . 
i cleaned it thinking that maybe that would help ,  but to no avail . 
a ridge that can get caught on things when you put the phone in your pocket or purse . 
the cards come to life similar to baten kaitos ,  and phantasy star online num_extend
i like this bra except for the fact the back part looks wadded after you wear it awhile . 
the screen protector was included and the vendor shipped the item very promptly . 
i m big on scents and this product does not do it for me . 
at first i was excited .  .  . but when i played it .  .  . oh boy . 
so ,  i repaired it and it has lasted longer than it did when it came out of the box . 
with this ,  if you want it to do more ,  you have to buy additional items . 
i am sure the video was correct ,  but it did not help . 
it s really dry and scratchy on your skin . 
while the blade cuts nicely and does its job ,  the construction left a lot to be desired . 
during editing ,  it should be possible to speed up and slow down the playback . 
 why aren t companies held accountable for this type of behavior ?   there s simply no excuse for this . 
not necessarily a bad thing if the product is supported . 
bounty should just go back to your high quality product we purchased for years . 
i do not want to shave all the hair off ,  just trim . 
set up is difficult and the instructions are not explained well . 
i had trouble sleeping on days when i took it . 
wish i hadn t of bought a num_num pack . 
white cheddar used to be my favorite kernel season s flavor before i learned how to read ingredient labels carefully . 
music appreciation ?  ?  whatever .  bubble scrubber  :  the one redeeming game on this cartridge . 
when it came time to add accessories ,  i did next to no homework . 
this filter is strong and very quiet ,  but with one big problem !  the end keeps falling off . 
i am not worry because my son never put stuffs into his mouth but other kids may . 
she was just trying to play . and third ,  the door hinge to open the camper falls off too easily . 
this cream did not help me with anything . 
i bought a small flexees to wear under a tight dress . 
this company needs to get their quality control act together . 
i purchased two of these kits to use ,  simply as an amusement . 
i bought my num_extend when it first came out . 
and to add insult to injury ,  you can t return it to the store once you ve opened it . 
do not buy this soap !  it burns and dries your skin like crazy . 
i tried it and it didnt work for me like it did others . 
which makes impossible to tuning derailleur . for the price ,  this is one of the cheapest bike stand i found . 
if this is your first spyro experience ,  you probably wont be as dissapointed  except for the bugs  . 
i can see putting a pair of jeans and almost nothing num_extend
when i hooked it up ,  it didn t connect . 
never ever ever buy card board scratch pads . 
however .  .  . while it s a great looking watch ,  sadly ,  this watch has been given away due to its ludicrous ticking . 
you might want to check soemthing else out for your i phone . 
there are no real symptoms besides its hot sides ,  but it dies after that . 
i thought that this case was super cute ,  and was excited to get it . 
if they had such a good product why did they change it into a piece of garbage . 
this is the second time i purchased this item and the first one was chewed to bits . 
it doesnt matter what the screen resolution says ,  the iphone image is more contrasty and pops from the screen . 
my first loaf was a soggy ,  compact ,  num_num inch high reject with no browning on the top crust . 
you will be chasing gold coins down for the most part . there just isn t enough to this game . 
this looks more like a cat toy than a dog toy . 
i am disappointed in this fun house three way mirror . 
the spray is even worse ,  a real waste of my time and cash . 
finally ,  i had a means of randomly playing num_num of my favorite songs without having to use my computer . 
i d already read reviews about jade cocoon num_extend so i knew it wouldn t be like the original . 
the only problem i have out of the box is how slippery this is on a granite counter top . 
i work in grocery business and i am moving all the time . 
i can t blame them completely because i bumped them into the stock . 
she tore though it after num_num minutes and it is ruined ans useless . 
i own several usa made revere pots and pans from the num_extend and they are wonderful . 
i tried it and i don t care for it . 
i m worried that i could get a uti from the scent if i wear them . 
i like how this one is shaped and i really like the color and i like all the pockets . 
only num_num grams of protein per bar which isn t enough to justify the ingredients or bad taste . 
i was surprised at how much flex there were in the wires as well . 
unlike many routers this one doesn t allow you to navigate to num_extend and punch in your important info . 
the tape is way too thick for safe use in my view . 
i bought a wooden toy hoping for long term durability but this was not the case . 
i ll give two more days  for two weeks  and request a charge back on my card . 
why couldn t anco simply replicate the two squeeze buttons ? this blade has a really large spoiler over the spine . 
i got what i paid for which was a crap product . 
as a matter of fact ,  i m restarting my career on mw just so i can forget carbon . 
by including so many ages ,  it spread itself to thin to greatly capture the essense of any particular age . 
my husband saw me struggling to open it and offered to open it for me . 
i would have returned the products  i bought two  but it is too much of a hassle . 
as a qa personnel myself ,  i noticed markings on both batteries where they have been installed and removed . 
who doesn t love the simpsons ?  i certainly do !  !  i watch all their episodes  new and old  . 
it was suggested that i get a white noise machine . 
i vomit when i think of this product . 
the bass is reduced ,  that s the reason ,  it does not blur even at high volumes . 
i needed a replacement usb cord for my digital camera . 
this is only an ok shampoo + conditioner . 
however ,  the very first day in my pocket with these new screen protectors ,  it came out with scratches . 
i am very disappointed in this product !  !  first of all it s way too small . 
put only num_num tablets in a bottles  i started noticing deterioration at about one num_extend
it s an abomination to the license and one of the worst games ever created in the history of nintendo . 
the quality of keds has deteriorated sooo much recently . 
when the remote is working properly is works well . 
one would expect to see some results at least halfway through the bottle . 
while she likes to play it with it ,  it has some significant draw backs . 
plus ,  we are finding that because it doesn t have the good grill flavor ,  we are avoiding it . 
this was a replacement for a krupps processor and i only used it num_num times . 
i have num_num of each of those left ,  a cranbran blueberrybran ,  appleberry ,  and chocolate fig . 
i know this is a low cost product ,  it should at least work . 
this mask also restricted air flow through my nose . 
in a steady light rain it leaked like a sieve . 
personally ,  i don t like having to replace a tool over and over again . 
the price was cheap but the picture quality was very poor . 
if you have very dry skin that does not break out then you may like this . 
that way a new infection won t get the chance to start . 
blood tests may indicate kidney failure  increased urea nitrogen and creatinine  . 
i would have to say to be careful and try on one that is not important . 
the problem is i ve had to replace mine about num_num times because water gets into the battery compartment . 
thinking about returning it but dreaded by the hassle . not worth a dime . 
but they failed big time with this puzzle rack . 
today ,  i realize dim was most likely causing some very weird ,  scary headaches ,  swollen eye s  ,  and blurry vision . 
mine would not boot because the card used too much energy . 
the legs cant sit tje knees dont bend and the wig is only looks good on the pink side . 
now that i have i suppose i ll have to sell it in an attemp to recoup something . 
the stains come out and the carpet is left almost dry . 
the only good this knife had was how sharp the blade was . 
it only works for me if i physically hold it in the outlet otherwise it shuts off . 
this whisk seems fancy and expensive ,  but my cheap whisks work much better . 
give it a few weeks of daily use ,  and i am sure you will be happy you did . 
the pump whined away for a while ,  but nothing came out of the nozzle . 
it didn t die instantly ,  but in the stages of a few days . 
i bought this product along with natural calm  which i started with  . 
like anything new ,  it took some time for me to really become a pro at using it . 
you do battle with these elements as well . 
when i emailed customer support about an rma number ,  they said to format the card which i did . 
these are very well written and laugh out loud funny . 
i obviously can t return them but i will be ordering another pair with the original footbed . 
my kids don t play with it ,  even num_num days out from christmas . 
the sound ceased to work on the one at work . 
at first glance ,  shadowbane offers players a wealth of opportunities . 
as many reviews as i write ,  i wish i would ve read the others listed on here . 
it appears to have undocumented compatibility issues with windows xp . 
sadly this was my second attempt to get the identical one . 
i took a chance on the monitors anyway ,  and it was a huge mistake . 
i had to throw away quite abit of it . 
i didn t even put it together after looking at it . 
the vegetable broths in canned tuna may contain onion . 
it aired out my little kitchen as i expected from its size . 
the first medal of honor for playstation num_num is better than this peice of garbage . 
i have a large female doberman and this fell off her and tripped her . 
terrible for my skin ,  burning ,  and dryness ,  made my skin look awful ,  i will never use roc products again . 
as noted by many other reviewers ,  this flavor  jalapeno cheddar  induces coughing fits in many people . 
the characters simply stand in place and wave their hands about . 
they ll play anything if it s given good reviews and other people like it . 
i really tried persistently for about num_num days to get my cats to eat this . 
well ,  that s not saying much ,  compared to even the worst games on the xbox num_extend
i have since tried shea moisture curling control shampoo three more times with the same result . 
requres a num_num minute soak before it can be eaten . 
yes this toy does shut off too quick . 
the wire on this bra may be on the outside but it still dug into my in cage . 
whats the use of that ?  !  waste of my money . 
they don t seem to work well together at all . 
several months ago ,  my oldest moved out and i gave him the microwave  and this turntable  . 
this was the first wii game i got ,  and its mostly because i couldn t get a hold of zelda . 
i can not express how disappointed i am with the seller of this product . 
the incident makes me think that this fan presents an unacceptable safety hazard . 
i had such a hard time getting it out of my pocket . 
i took it apart and there was nothing wrong . 
i wanted to like this product so badly because i ve always read and heard great things about infusium num_extend
but im not rating them just the product . 
then it looks trashy . it protects but i won t be getting a case like this one . 
the serpa system will not allow you to mount different holster types ,  or different gun types . 
it s a shame because the curling iron actually curled fairly well . 
tanner ,  your main character ,  moves ackwardly and shoots even worse . 
i think that sums up the reviews ,  both the bad and good ones . 
very cheaply made and probably will never use them but i have them . 
i am not a happy customer this time . 
the bubbles that hit the ground stayed and did not pop right away . 
i bought this after dropping my iphone and shattering its glass . 
while the tea flavor was too fake tasting ,  the others might actually be alright . 
gave these as a gift and the recipient was surprised at how  dainty  they were . 
several sites that gave it rave reviews have yanked the reviews . 
i tried this for my cat ,  as i read that it will deter both cats and dogs . 
switch is fairly easy to activate though it is small and cheap feeling . 
i had surround subwoofers laying on the couch at night and it was amazing . 
i read all the good reviews and bought . 
could buy a nicer reusable one that would pay for itself in a couple of years . 
i bought this at the same time as i purchased my zen plus . 
ordinarily ,  this wouldn t be a problem with amazon . 
cute toy ,  and my son was soooo excited about it ,  but yoshi broke by the next day . 
i purchased this set because i was sick of cleaning the typical wood cutting board built into the counter . 
people are very loyal to their brands and bose is no execption . 
i repeat the creator of metal gear was not even involved in this . 
customer service was not willing to acknowledge their error . 
great for people who only want to carry a limited amount of items . i returned the item . 
considering all the rave reviews ,  i was really looking forward to this being an answer to my cellulite problem . 
i think maybe it is too warm for smaller animals . 
the gel is extremely effective in keeping my dogs teeth white and plaque free . their breath quality is also excellent . 
but more importantly ,  they re really quite foul in taste . 
i replaced the sub ,  but now one of the satellites has loud static . 
but when i received it ,  i was so disappointed . 
however ,  that was around num_num months ago ,  and i still have not received the return authorization . 
after using the trimmer a few times ,  the guard will not stay in place . 
i then offered them to two friends and they declined . 
it only has the standard num_num cb channels . 
you can do yourself a favor and shop for another brand . 
i was so excited to get this puzzle for my little ones . 
not even all that much olive oil flavor . 
shipping was great .  .  . arrived days before expected date ,  however when we got the case ,  it wasn t silicone . 
the angle of the flat liner also makes it hard to draw on eyebrows and fill them in . 
does not work well enough on my small dog ,  i should have just used scissors . 
my dog had unraveled the braid within num_num minutes . 
so keep that in mind ,  driving around is fun ,  but actually completing the missions is super difficult . 
this is the beaver version . the dog won t be here until tomorrow ,  which is good . 
the process of applying this screen protector almost felt like science class . 
despite being promoted as a premium ,  healthy dog food ,  this is not . 
most important ,  they came with a particularly noxious order which cemented my overall dissatisfaction . 
i did not like the new graphics ,  they seemed too cartoony to me . 
hey ,  at least from the critical success ,  it establishes the nintendo num_num as the premiere system for wrestling . 
that brought peace . if these had leaked from only one place ,  i would not have such a negative impression . 
actually i found the oil sprayer made of glass . 
how many times are they going to milk this same cow ? pros : +excellent action+bodyguards a . i . 
the only thing it provides is a stinky odor . 
if you do get some on your scalp it rubs away with little problem . 
i ll try washing them with fabric softener ,  but i think they re just a waste of money . 
it s cheaper but the particle size is like num_num something vs num_num something with hydrolyzed . 
it goes everywhere . other than that ,  it s a great grinder . 
even with the remote right next to the ir transmitter ,  it now does not work most of the time . 
having it serviced by a nikon authorized tech is cost prohibitive . 
my two cents ?  save your money and don t bother till it hits the bargain bin . 
this coffee maker will be good for someone on the go who does not like strong coffee . 
since i went back to my old mascara the infections have cleared up . 
the rhytm was so fast . seriously ,  this game needed some modifications before it was released to the market . 
one gets a full cup of noodles as a result . 
you d better be a ginger lover ,  that s most definite . 
we had to wait for pokemon colosseum to give us the experience that we really needed . 
after that he gets a talking boat and a goofy wand that ,  apparently ,  lets him controll the wind . 
i am going to say this is a vastly over rated product . 
think  mini games  . on the plus side :  it is will wright ,  the concept and graphics are very interesting . 
but the still ever uncured infection remains present ,  still . 
scared to think how long these will last . 
it buckled up our newly refinished wood floors while sitting there before we realized what happened . 
i put these in my aquarium and they got white stringy stuff all over them . 
i don t know if it happened in shipping or what . 
the more tea i try the less i like it . 
i thought it would be in the middle of the sapphire ,  that makes sense . 
when my credit card statement showed up the following week ,  there was the charge for $
they frequently get lost on the screen clutter . 
the only way that i could download was to use a card reader . 
on top of that ,  this game has some nice graphics ,  but that is only in the clouds . 
i am always open to try new products in the hopes of even a better result . 
i need one nd filter so i choose it on amazon . 
it showed the home screen and said  waiting  ,  then it turns off automatically . 
very disappointed i was expecting something way better than this . 
the xxl length was good but the girth was gigantic . 
i finally ended up cutting the seats away from the shredded arm portions and using them as independent floats . 
not a real good flavor at all ,  taste like cheap bouillion cubes . 
it left my skin feeling dry and felt like it left a film on my skin . 
i thought it would be better for my daughter to shoot . 
when the dog barked the device sprayed him . 
probably because animals cats hunt don t make a  rattling  sound . 
then one day ,  packets were being dropped again  on the same powerbook  . 
the wood handle feels very rough and splintery and needs to be sanded and oiled . 
the problem is in practice ,  the powerlift doesn t keep its charge very long . 
it says that it is an num_num piece but mine only came with num_num pieces . 
do not waste your money or time on this game . 
the thing still works after a month ,  but makes horrible mechanical rattling noises as it plays . 
it was kind of cute ,  but everything just seemed dull and repetitive . 
here s a game which attempts to exploit itself as a  revolutionary  sequel to the previous games . 
was hoping for at least a few months of chew time out of it . 
but i wanted it a little brighter ,  so i pressed the up arrow to make it brighter . 
the first problem i experienced with this game as the key code wouldn t work . 
i have something like num_extend and i don t see myself ever using it all . 
but the cups were so large i cannot wear the bra . 
i have a two year old sony cassette player in my car . 
i was never able to get a signal from two sources to one . 
the lighting is ok at night ,  worthless in the . 
first ,  if you have ridden a bike for fifty years you get use to how a seat should feel . 
not to mention ,  the green tea litter was tracked all over . 
don t waste your money ,  buy something with quality that has num_num or num_num ball bearings . 
the color of the liquid is different than the one i got from derm office locally . 
although i have had dickies in the past ,  the quality of the sewing around the zipper was bad . 
medal of honor ,  rising sun ,  was badgered by complaints of  no strategy  and stupid enemy ai . 
after a few frantic seconds and some really powerful yanks ,  i got it out and engaged the targets . 
i bought three of these shirts and this particular style is just o . k . 
okay it came stale in the case but where s the cheese was my first question . 
this bluetooth hold static without being on the phone . 
the lens would not focus correctly; it frontfocused horribly . 
around the hips very narrow then balloon out basically made like and hour glass . 
this one didn t thrill either one of us . 
i thought this would be a good product to help learn the abcs ,  but it really hasn t helped . 
it was either shards of metals or something else ,  i have no idea what the pole was made from . 
the rack arrived with one of the cross pieces broken . 
the single player was much too short ,  the bosses are too easy to kill ,  and the scenery is atrocious . 
other brands are easier to use and take more abuse ,  but cost twice as much . 
giving it the benefit of the doubt i tried brewing it using every water size on my keurig . 
please try to avoid this game and save some cash . 
very well done . the use of the portals was very good . 
this has always been one of my and my sweet little dog s favorite treats . 
the clear cover of the phone case also seems to be of substandard quality . 
this has the exact consistency ,  color ,  and smell as room temperature butter . 
i dont consider myself to have super skinny arms . 
i ve been using the roc deep correction wrinkle cream morning and night now for about a month . 
and overnite they didn t care that it was there . 
i always buy unscented items so they don t clash with my perfume . 
then both my desktop and laptop lost connection to the internet . 
it it a bit too small and i would not recommend this screen protector . 
even using extra care ,  however; there was quite a bit of my hair wrapped tightly around the band . strike two . 
and both openings are quite small  and both opening are not from ground up either  . 
i m still using it but i am becoming increasingly concerned . 
i will stick to ones that i find in local middle eastern or indian grocery stores . 
i just bought this product and the jerky was so hard i was afraid i would break a tooth . 
neither kitten has had any interest in this toy . 
in fact ,  i have a hard time recommending it . 
this one is definitely not . the gift looks lovely . 
the box is now two weeks old and falling apart . 
the marketplace vendor was excellent in taking the product back and service . 
i had to take it out of the case to get the device to work . 
i guess i just am too busy to wait while the stuff absorbs . 
i was bummed they didn t carry an alternative model i liked so i could still give them my money . 
it s well worth the money for those results . 
i wish i could have read the ingredients before i bought it . 
which is weird because she rubs up against everything else on the floor . 
i tried to put it on my laptop ,  desk ,  window ,  etc . 
had it less than a year and it has quit working . 
even the corn popper push toys aren t as loud . 
so excited to see this one same size that he wanted . 
these earphones do not stay in the ear while exercising . 
i like a fresh pair of nail nippers for my constant hang nails . 
she put some half and half in hers ,  and she could barely choke it down . 
just because the controller shakes in your hands doesn t mean you feel like part of the game . 
luckily i only needed it for num_extend but doesn t say a lot about the build quality . 
the vet suggested i start cleaning the cat s teeth since there is tartar buildup . 
i don t know a single person that likes these things . 
however ,  at least if you do not over pronate ,  this shoe is not for you . 
i do not know why i ignored over num_num one star reviews . 
i will add more to the review after i ve used the new one . 
my son is four and has a hard time using this toy . 
i was impressed when i received an airmail envelope from hong kong . 
however the camel one is with soft fur but the size is a little small . 
consistency is also poor made me break out . 
i say this because i have had my phone land face down on the ground . 
is it just me or is there something wrong with this scenario . 
i m passing these on to the kitties in the habitat my rescue group has at petco . 
earthen ware junk that doesn t deserve the corelle name . 
couldn t get my computer to recognize the digital camera so had to send it back . 
in short ,  the two elements of the filter might as well be made of window glass . 
i think that s the secret it s the alcohol . 
format war ended ,  and hd dvds are near impossible to find . 
think it s time to stay away from levis . 
in short ,  unlike the nordicware popper ,  the presto microwave popper actually works . 
my detangling process took the same amount of time . 
if you can afford a better filter i would suggest looking at other models . 
it does require regular thorough cleaning each use ,  but that s not as bad as everyone claims . 
this product is expensive and it caused eye irritation . 
without information ,  i decided to base my rating on taste alone . 
it may work in a different bathtub than mine ,  but i would rather feel safe !  . 
i ve got a $ paring knife that cuts and slices better and easier than this one . 
i am bummed it s broken ,  but it was so cheap that it is not worth me returning it . 
i do like lots of other philosophy products . 
the only reason i bought this game is because it had this so called  game of the year  thingy . 
i don t feel this mascara gave my existing lashes any length and the mascara was kind of clumpy . 
i can t get my money back since the return window is closed but that s ok . 
not a fan of the product at all . 
it s just a bunch of techno beats that we ve all heard from better games . 
it is not worth the hassle indicated by others to file a warranty claim . 
when i installed the combiner i immediately noticed a degraded signal especially from the cable box . 
they are absolutely terrified if i try to play with it ,  and give it wide birth . 
i knew it was inexpensive when i bought it ,  but i didn t think it was cheap . 
we ve had it for a couple of weeks . 
despite the item description ,  not compatible with num_num dodge suvs which have canbus autolights . 
i used the wireless in various parts of my house and was disappointed in the range . 
but we always have access to wifi at home or in the office . 
i thought that the high ratings meant that it would help condition my dry ,  overprocessed hair . 
poor job !  leaves patches of hair on your head and face . 
it looks good on ,  but application is a pita . 
the toast still probably tastes the same as if both sides of the bread were the same darkness . 
they had a gold or bronze kind of a tint to them with stripes in the center . 
it was difficult if not impossible for the dogs to get the treats out . 
that should tell you how much time they spent on this one . 
it only works occassionally now and is not reliable at all . 
so i pay my $ and drive home to install it . 
then wait for an eternity for the map to load . 
you have to find the parts of your ship and the pikmin help you . 
i do not recommend anyone buy this one . 
turned out that it was way too big and thick for my dog ,  so i had to return it . 
i don t see how they can hold up . 
this product with the cover on was not large enough for my smaller sized teddy bear hamster . 
glad to hear it works for some ,  but didn t for me . 
also the high upper strap was tight on my slender boney foot and i found it painful . 
i would have liked there to be more strategy than just button mashing ,  but what the heck ,  it s fun . 
the taste is ok ,  and easy enough to chew through ,  and i won t throw them away . 
they often fall off ,  and i ve stopped using it all together . 
the long slots of the spoon have a tendency to trap some sizes of pasta . 
and not just from the noxious smells that the glow pen gives off either . 
i thought i was getting full size containers . 
i m really bummed this food isn t being accepted . 
i was told by a barber that the spots were a sign of impurities in the alum . 
the photos i am posting are a close ups of the skin near the left ear . 
i have tried every method of food preservation there is . 
you can fight one on one with someone else who has the game . 
there is still no create a team mode . 
fun to play ,  but it s asking a lot gamers to look past its glaring shortcomings . 
this is a nicely manufactured product ,  looks good ,  fine build quality . 
i grew up playing games in arcades ,  and at home on my atari num_extend
very cheaply made and broke before i got it . 
sorry , mickey ,  but i am a donald duck fan . 
there is just nothing to it and fits poorly . 
my cat seems to have a few specific spots where she is marking . 
was i ever shocked when i opened the package to find pink bands . 
the game play is very poor and kluggy . 
i had to run the machine outside and pour water on it to stop it from burning . 
they sent a replacement and it had the same exact problem . 
i was giving my shihtzu the fromm adult gold dog food . 
it has the proper angle to scrape and pull the water from the surface with each stroke . 
the only differences are :  different characters and setting ,  badder music ,  and the controls a bit more unresponsive . 
after shown what was possible with spiderman num_extend this game is a big let down . 
its getting cheaper ,  and the price is getting closer to what its worth . 
i had purchased gnc salmon oil and they like that product much better and lap it up . 
it s possible this one was a bad batch ,  but seemed to be doomed either way . 
i also felt very groggy and out of it the next day too . 
i suppose that s because most people use their computers to make their cd compilation disks . 
i have ordered num_num other of these cases in num_num different color . 
he said ,  well it s expired now ,  how do you want to pay for this . 
i wear a size num_extend and the stone pair are tight on me . 
i read the reviews and then made the purchase . 
don t take my word for it ,  research it on the web yourself . 
the lack of matches is alsoa big negitive . 
then they pick up another tiny little piece and bring it back to the airport . 
they front is not the gold glitter ,  but a bright solid yellow color . 
i used this and it didn t add volume to my hair ,  not even a little bit . 
i hate leaving bad reviews ,  but i honestly hate this product . 
the sticker in the front is not as attractive as the one in the picture . 
those reviews that love this doll ,  i m guessing are from buyers that left her sealed in the box . 
the tools were more worth the money than the actual battery itself . 
i gave it numerous tries with many different polishes  essie ,  opi ,  chanel ,  nars ,  etc  and top coats  sv ,  poshe  . 
it consists of your running around in a single location for several hours ,  gathering treasure and collecting points . 
this game has a total of num_num of them . 
and even then ,  the tea didn t have the same quality to it . 
even before i used it on meat ,  i tried it out on a folded kitchen towel . 
so forget your ipod or your newer blackberry or newer wireless device ,  period . 
it was going flat within an hour or two . 
sometimes a cheap item isn t worth what you pay for it . 
i am ashamed that i didnt think it through before i gave my dogs these bones . 
it is difficult to place the earpiece on my ear with glasses on . 
but i it is hard for me to believe the amazon would participate in fraudulent activity such as this . 
it only has an analog stereo headphones out . 
their tech support was quick to respond ,  but unable to solve the problem . 
the silicone for me started to fall apart and wear down to a hole . 
the older one eats it perfectly ,  tearing off little pieces at a time ,  chewing ,  swallowing . 
we just blow it back up and a week later blow it up again . 
i have two of these fans and bought a second one based on loving the first . 
when i received this product the lid was not securely tight and the solvent leaked out . 
i bought one of these the minute i first saw it ,  based on my happiness with the gerber eab . 
however other than the tournament settings ,  the changes seemed to have no effect . 
 seems to be about par for vtech toys .   the three shaped buttons don t seem to do much . 
too bad the makers of  scratches  didn t give us the stuff . this game will be forgotten quickly i think . 
my hair looked and felt much greasier than before i washed to a disgusting level . 
i wasn t taking a num_extend go at a stump or anything . 
i wish i would have had the chance to test this one out but it s going back to amazon . 
after a few weeks ,  my lips became so irritated that they were raw and scraped . 
i swapped in another drive ,  and it to amazon . 
the stove itself is just like the picture but needed a little num_extend to get it to move easier . 
maybe she didn t shake it enough but neither of us liked it . 
i have no idea why this tasted so bad to me . 
that means with milk ,  a bowl of crunchy nut is going to be num_num calories or slightly more . 
guys who are purchasing from outside the us ,  be careful ,  it operates at num_extend
i will need to try that out ,  but it does not excuse ernie ball from their responsibility . 
i believe a lighter color would not be as noticeable regarding the problems i had . 
don t waste your time ,  money ,  or yogurt on this poorly made device . 
it truly does nothing !  okay ,  chuck does some flips and that s it !  loldo not buy !  !  !  . 
i will have to try another type next time . 
however ,  after about num_num uses ,  of the outputs works very poorly . 
that may be fine for things like shoes ,  but for car leather ,  especially dashboards ,  it s not good . 
i rate it at two stars rather than one for the innovative design . 
i am giving this product a one star review because it did not work for me . 
while playing online ,  norse always dominate because they build several fortresses right outside your town then attack . 
more often than not ,  i would forget about it ,  and would return to an inedible soupy mess . 
i really wanted to like it .  .  . but it is heavy and not a tinted moisturizer on my face . 
not to mention a simple power adaptor should last more than num_num months . 
the cuts on the protectors are not align properly . 
i d read the previews and was very excited to try out the new controller . 
at one point i literally couldn t get past one stage because he kept falling off . 
i must have the worlds most stupid birds . 
im not sure if it is due to my car or the charger but this no longer works . 
at first i couldn t believe this until i compared that strap to the others that came with it . 
i d never put this on in a large area again . 
so ,  i bought it and started using it right away . 
didn t seem to make any difference in my breakouts . 
it will have a num_extend hd ,  and hdmi output . 
i bought mine at gnc and returned them today . 
there is a round sticker around the entire blade ,  and it does not come off easily . 
i discovered that the only difference between white ,  whole wheat ,  etc . 
i noticed that i was able to focus significantly better ,  but only on less complex tasks . 
tried to use this great looking cable from the cable outlet to the cable box . 
brush is soft and doesn t hurt her mouth though . 
it costs about double of what the ssscat unit costs but i definitely recommend the contech over ssscat . 
the samsung keeps skipping audio when playing dts soundtracks . 
this item is garbage at best !  !  my num_extend has a better battery life then this waste of material . 
it s hard to detangle a tiny part without having the brush to catch on another part that im detangling . 
i paid way too much for this one to begin with but the size is great . 
in that period ,  i used it in my camera . 
my head is average but this fits a bit big . 
it just doesn t have the leverage to cut the grass . 
you d think rim would give you something new that works well . 
seeds fall out of the feeder very easily . all in all ,  there are any number of decent feeders out there . 
the tip goes back into the pen and it is not worth it the hassle or pain . 
i tried it again with more product and ,  it was a caked on mess . 
misses a lot of hair have to go it time and time again and a battery hog . 
this wide brimmed visor gives your face and ears coverage from the sun . 
he s num_num yrs old ,  so i trust he knows what he s talking about . 
first of all ,  it says in the instructions that it isn t for jaw pain . 
don t waste your money if you are buying it for its intended purpose . 
i spent a week researching coveralls online ,  reading reviews ,  looking at sizes ,  etc . 
is the ear wash so essential that it is worth risking your cat s life ?  perhaps try another product first . 
the repairman asked me what types of animals i had . 
for many people ,  bose products seem like the ideal for good sound . 
the following day ,  the circles were more wrinkled then ever . 
i don t get all the good reviews ,  it was a big waist of money to me . 
my num_num cat did this all by himself . 
it does work for a fuller bath ,  but it is a pain to clean . 
another cat might like this flavor just fine but my crew does not . 
i can apply screen protectors without getting even one single air pocket . 
looked like a pretty bra and seemed well made ,  but i had to return . 
the pcb also needed more offset mounts to prevent bending . 
i guess you get what you pay for . 
regardless of desired thickness it does not emulsify as the directions state . 
i find it annoying that you can buy the same brand briefs and get a different fit . 
was trying to tint fog lights and just didnt work . 
i only got six months of occasional use out of this before it quit . 
i ll certainly drink what i have ,  but won t be ordering it again . 
perhaps its a differnet model etc but the new one is significantly smaller . 
i ve had a braun num_num for years .  .  . got this to replace the cutter and foil . 
it shouldn t be a daily chore just to connect your headset to your computer . 
i went from never taking probiotics to taking this one and i never saw a difference or felt different . 
you may think you are helping your lawn ,  but you are actually making it worse . 
i do not know if it would have worked better had i been able to plug it in . 
these have a noticeable difference from what i get from the grocery store . 
but the num_extend colors seem to be overenhanced . 
the adhesive would not stick on one corner ,  even after being clamped down overnight . 
it boils all over the counter and hardly no coffee is left in pot . 
it needs a hose to fit more stem configurations . 
this pattern continued to repeat before i finally decided to return it for a refund . 
i had to put in the freezer in the garage because the smell was so strong . 
it comes with really no usable instructions ,  and any videos online didn t help either . 
the only good thing about this is graphics . 
i think the manufacturer should state the fact that these devices do not work well inside office buildings . 
finally out of frustration i got out the metric die set and chased the threads . 
it was supposedly going to fit our dustbuster but it didn t . 
that s a lot of body spraying all over my body . 
autolyzed yeast extract is another way of saying msg . 
not even a silver oxide version would get you num_extend that capacity . 
in fact i don t think any mmo i have played before even comes close to being this bad . 
i could not continue using it because of this and had to buy something else . 
i will say that i am blessed in the genes department and look a lot younger than i am . 
i find myself needing to constantly adjust them while running or at the gym . 
maybe one of the others will be more potent in the scent department . 
this is probably the worst product i have ever used . 
after one use of this sunscreen ,  my face and neck broke out !  i had clear skin before this . 
i really like the motomco tomcat rat snap trap version . 
i ve not given up on this stuff yet but it s not a perfect solution . update :  lowering it to two stars . 
its worked a few times but just turns off . 
i find one product that works and stick with it ,  even if it s meant for the opposite sex . 
the price was low ,  but so is the comfort level . 
it can take almost num_num hours to detangle my hair . 
i checked here for reviews and yeah ,  this ne goes back for sure . 
they offered to sell me a new one though !  i have no idea where my receipt is  my fault  . 
this product is too big for small bread puppies ,  so would recommend a different version for smaller breads . 
and too many of them are so used to living their lives that way . 
when it arrived it would pull in some stations great others not so great . 
the ridges are so far apart ,  i feel like it s impossible to file anything properly . 
then i started to notice that it was quite loud for the first few minutes after startup . 
even my little sandisk sensa radio s doing better than this big plastic thing . 
i suggest using water of num_num degrees or cooler . my experience with this dragonwell was disappointing . 
i was ordering silk but the subscription service on silk vanilla soy was cancelled by amazon . 
come on mattel .  .  .  .  . i m sure most customers who have the time would instantly return these cheap toys . 
it just didn t work for what i wanted . 
seriously ,  i can t understand why this case gets such good reviews . 
it seemed like a good idea at first ,  but i really should never have purchased this crappy product . 
if you don t ,  then there is no picture at all . 
i felt nauseous almost all the time on zantrex . 
the shirt also seemed a little large and the material a little thin . 
they don t look much different ,  but the raider didn t start jamming till they got into these extra darts . 
so much for it saying it fits this model . 
the lower bass is artificially boosted and the upper freqs are rolled off . 
the case interior is hard plastic and the palm doesn t even fit snugly . 
this does have a nice purple color to it but it just wasn t for me . 
i have ordered other arch supports from spenco and have liked them . 
i do not believe these are moisturizing gloves . 
i returned to the verizon store where i bought it and exchanged it for another identical unit . 
it makes their back arch in a way that isn t num_extend
these appeared after i used the skillet for the first time to fry chicken . 
again ,  compared to my other model ,  this holds far less num_extend
you can get a cs recon num_num of another $ an fyi and my opinion . 
rent it and see if you like it .  .  . then if you do fork over the dough . 
excel is more difficult to use than a calculator and quite difficult to master in all its aspects . 
the cost is much cheaper at a big box chain . 
it shouldn t even be considered an accessory at all . 
this camera uses fuji  and olympus  new  xd  memory . 
it promised to be a great product and durable . 
particularly the end parts . this toy is expensive and does not work . 
it was dried out and i broke out everywhere . so far the best i have used is the simple brand . 
for what it is made for ,  it absolutely does what it s supposed to . 
there is a lot of repetition in the battles and the story lines are very weak . 
cleaning was more convenient . if i scored the shaver on closeness and speed ,  it would get num_num num_extend
matte doesn t have to mean  dull  ,  and that s where this product finds most of it s fault . 
and ,  i questioned how protective and versatile it would be . 
i was under the impression that when ordering this i got num_num lens . 
i wouldn t recommend it nor will i be purchasing it again . 
linksys routers also tend to be more reliable than this . 
by the second day my pits are starting to turn red and burn . 
there is still glue and bits of paper that i am still picking off . 
the volume can get very loud however .  .  .  .  . the voice call answer doesnt always understand me . 
the first few times i used it ,  it performed admirably . 
guess these are too cheap for fender to have qc on . will try other brands next time . 
plus ,  it would no longer fit into it s box ,  which i use to store all the parts . 
it s back to the braun kmm num_num for us . 
zagg offers lifetime replacement but i m pretty sure i voided that by trimming this . 
the game itself is surrounded on the ring and the first few rows of ringside seating and nothing else . 
do yourself a huge favor and don t buy this set . 
i usually just take the whole piece off . fourth ,  its just plain boring . 
it may work really well ,  but i m not going to get the chance to find out . 
i have purchased these treats from my pet food store many time and they were always bright orange . 
not impressed by any stretch ,  but it appears to be adequate . 
i suggest finding more natural products that will work for your hair and scalp . 
you can email me and thank me later . 
since this moisturizer is basically the highest rated sunscreen on the market ,  i m sort of at a loss now . 
very disapointed in this game !  it lacks everything that makes a rts great . 
they certainly have little idea what is fun . 
maybe it s just me but it smells exactly like how i remember a new barbie used smell like . 
have tried ,  and really enjoy ,  the blueberry and raspberry by brookside . 
so i will just have to keep looking for something she won t tear a hole in . 
i was expecting a better tasting drink for something that claims to be % juice . 
add to that alot of the dungeons have spawn timers on them in the game . 
these cables are good for charging overnight but not much more . 
not sure if it is defective or just awful . 
i wanted a waterproof bag to put my fitbit zip  electronic pedometer  in and get some pool time credit . 
yes ,  i have the height and angle adjusted correctly . 
i wanted a phone with a good display ,  true num_extend data ,  and lots of available apps . 
kids with paper bags over their heads are beating something bloody in a canvas sack . 
i did that ,  and even after quite a bit of stirring wound up with something less than great . 
thinks it s the best thing that happened to him ,  but it doesn t do the job for us . 
they strongly prefer the kind with a stream of water . 
that gives it one star and that s about it . it was giving off very toxic industrial bonding material smell . 
why ? because it s nothing but a piece of rubber . it doesn t look normal on the phone . 
i have been loving this yogurt maker until today when it ceased to function . 
besides ,  it burns my armpits and skin turns bright red . 
but look at the rest of the stuff !  too sweet ,  including artificial sweetener . 
color looked orange ,  smelled funny ,  but worst part was it stung and irritated my sensitive skin . 
it seems relatively safe unless you are on any type of blood thinner ,  including a baby asprin at night . 
it was because of this that i decided to give blair s a second chance . 
i grind my own coffee bean using eight o clock french roast . 
i also like the fact that you can cook without a timer . 
as others have said ,  it is very stiff ,  which does get better with wear . 
i dont believe i paid retail $ for this at my local bestbuy . 
that gives you a complete refund ,  and sends a message to belkin . 
looking to get num_extend version to hopefully solve this issue . 
i bought these after doing research on the best brand of tweezers and was really excited to get these . 
personally ,  i can see my daughter using baby alive much more . 
the bubbling is sort of cute but not relaxing ,  and it actually splashes out of the tub . 
sad to say the fleas are still sucking my cats dry . 
i thought it might be another product ,  but i didn t discontinue using that product ,  only the concealer . 
these taste like solid molasses bars ,  hardly any licorice flavor at all !  !  !  . 
these are far from clear ,  let alone crystal clear . 
absolutely horrible when put in shoes !  keep these little buggers in something other than shoes . 
i bought this model in december ,  num_num as a family christmas gift based on reviews i read here . 
i was hoping this was a much more play friendly toy . 
the digital number display is hard to read . 
it was the cheap price that lured me into buying num_num of these ,  but it s not made very well . 
i will never buy another hoya filter .  .  .  . they used to be better . 
but if i had to do it over ,  i would get a different bag . 
i started using the old transmitter and am very happy with it . 
jawbone are by the best bluetooth out there so therefore i purchased the icon hd . 
you can get a better taste from your own garbage disposal . 
kitchenaid should get zero stars for this one . 
i think i m going to have to buy something else . 
the included brush is not useful ,  i would use a kabuki instead . 
but at least they are working right now . 
according to the directions ,  it still should be working for at least another num_num wks . 
i also can t get it to work with our sony received . 
i have regular communication with members of their product development team regarding each product i use . 
will never order this sort of item again . 
the  service  person just denied that the smearing happened . 
i didn t hit it on anything or catch it on anything . 
both parties could make out what was being said but it wasn t close to being great . 
clearly manufacturing standards have dropped and the quality and design of this product has diminished . 
i would guess there is very little maple in here . 
it tightly fits the camera and thats it . 
though the graphics aren t as flashy as crazy taxi ,  i highly recommend  the simpsons :  road rage  as an alternative . 
you cannot change the name from penske to let s say  joes racing  or anything else you might want . 
instead of making my fine hair on edges grow ,  it caused irritation and my hair fell out . 
the quality control is definitely hit or miss . 
only by removing the case can i get a proper picture when i have the flash turned on . 
the glaive is incredibly weak and has such a short range of attack . 
in addition ,  somehow the msm made us feel uncomfortable and somewhat bloated . our own experience . 
the smell is not horrible like some people claim . 
i m a little concerned that it may have been tampered with . 
if you like your tea strong with milk ,  seek no further . 
the battery lasts on average num_num hours with barely any usage . 
the anchor hocking has more of a twist and a curl . 
the benadryl extra strength itch stopping gel istoo strong for my rash skin . 
it is easy on the tongue ,  and leaves the mouth refreshed . 
this back cushion appeared to have the lumbar support that was mentioned in the description . 
i washed the old one and will leave it to dry in the window for about num_num days . 
appears very flimsy which can be a concern as the base of the unit holds the water . 
the galaxy num_extend is the same price and has a metal gear box . 
my son did not even wear it for that many times . 
i don t regret buying it but i will not buy it again . 
the old on the plastic was brittle and things kept breaking but the unit still worked and functioned great . 
however ,  it is nothing like those old brushes so if that is what you are looking for ,  don t bother . 
the results from this were not what had been expected . 
great bags ,  but i have a feeling i cld have gotten them for cheaper somewhere else . 
i avoid oxybenzone which apparently disrupts human hormonal num_extend
i couldn t get it tight enough on the rail without the retainer nuts giving out . 
it doesn t look rusted until you look at it with a magnifying glass in direct sunlight . 
they now don t seal and i can t tell what the num_extend the deal is . 
this is confirmed true by all the reviews out there . 
but this is largely because of the packaging . 
we bought these for use with a third generation ipod and an iphone num_extend
anytime we ve ordered the former ,  it turns out to be crap . 
as a snack ,  there is a nasty aftertaste that i presume to be from the addition of antioxidants . 
the buttons are small and cumbersome ,  poorly labeled and laid out . 
i would only transfer half of the design to a nail and the rest would peel off . 
this print server doesn t work with windows num_extend
 once you figure out the correct dosage that you need . 
distance in the center lengthwise between padlock holes; num_extend
the case literally soaks up the sweat from your arm and soaks the back of your phone with it . 
it does not work and i used it diligently . 
i ve had the dmr num_extend for over two years now and it is terrible . 
aromas and essential oils have been shown to seriously affect various brain and internal organ functions . 
too loose for any hope of retention ,  and the belt clip broke the first time i used it . 
i was so excited when i found these blocks . 
she ate the ham and spat out the dog food . 
it is uncomfortable to use ,  cheaply made and was dull right out of the packaging . 
once again ,  squaresoft has screwed up another ff game . 
i couldn t even think of if it helped with sweating or not because the b . o . 
i also have checked with the bb website to ensure the current packing is silver cap . 
i got grey flannel from amazon after reading all the reviews . 
i began having all the symptoms of a cold and especially a sore throat and a cough . 
i had previously owned rs num_extend and they were lost . 
buttons are small but as with anything else ,  you adapt to it . 
look closely at the construction ,  and notice the plastic u shaped holder that actually holds the ear piece . 
these were nice size wisbut found them to be not the color they appeared to be . 
they don t sell products on their website ,  so the part about refunds cannot apply . 
i m sorry ,  but the ds mops the floor with the psp when it comes to actual gameplay . 
in num_num days ,  which impressed me to the max . 
i have very fine ,  naturally medium to dark brown hair with very little grey at the temples . 
he smashed it and threw it in the trash he hated it so much . 
i finally threw this game away from frustration . 
the main villain is some fat blue lady . 
it felt like i was biting on sand pieces . 
they look like they have been washed one hundred times  !  !  . 
i tried it out on his palm first and then the back of his hand . 
i trusted the positive reviews posted here and bought one . 
sometimes i get only a handful of pictures in before they die . 
the best suggestion was to uninstall and reinstall ,  perhaps without any memory cards . 
sucked on a few for a couple of days while doing work . 
one drawback on my end ,  didn t realize this takes rawhide refills so i would need to buy the refills . 
i still haven t been able to get it to work right . 
serves me right for trusting samsung and world wide distributors . 
even with apps like pandora radio the overview looks cheap . 
never had this problem with my motorola branded ones . 
the screen no longer slips into place when flipped open and the letter  a  has fallen out . 
there is nothing good to say about this cable . 
i have had this phone almost num_num weeks num_extend days  . 
at $ you get what you pay for . 
sure it gets a little better ,  but it s still there . this lens is frustrating !  i m selling mine !  . 
which is just fine for up to about num_num feet ,  maybe more . 
however ,  the color melted on some of my other prized cases and they were ruined . 
this model is useful to me only as a glorified watch . 
i will share with my audience both online and in person the sorry pitiful apology i received . 
only good thing is the graphics ,  but that s it . 
just turned out to be a waste of money from my perspective . 
the only thing soundtracker does to those signals is compress them . 
i never had a  potato  head when i was a kid so maybe i didn t really have realistic expectations . 
in these areas it completely covers your skin with a thick unnatural looking coating . 
steam sucked at the beginning ,  but it s awesome now ,  and doesn t spy on you . so please ,  guys . 
i can t believe people like this game so much ?  it s like playing a boring rpg . 
when i did ,  i was sent two order confirmations . 
those are not machined like others ,  these are casted and not very good . some show burrs from the molds . 
the company that sent them were kind enough to take them back . 
the fighting in the game is stupid as well because you just walk up and punch dudes . 
i don t know why they made it like that . 
it will happen ,  they are right next to each other . 
i ordered them ,  and was happy with how quickly i got them  love prime  . 
i think my husband put it toward the back of garage now .  .  . oh well . 
i like the boker knives that i have owned in the past and liked the design of this one . 
i don t believe this is the genuine ysl eclat product . 
more noise than i expected from a reasonably small toy . second ,  my cats did not interact with this toy . 
also ,  the white balance is off on most occasions . 
i went to sleep .  .  . not good ,  not even worth trying . 
unfortunately ,  two out of the three seem to have significantly weakened batteries . 
get a single edge ,  injector ,  or a straight razor  if you have time for their maintenance and learning curve  . 
you see jagged lines on filter surface ,  makes reading harder for you as well . 
we found another pizza stone at amazon which is thicker and seems to do a better job . 
these were not cut right to fit the evo . 
if i can do it ,  this opener should be able to as well . 
it get s very poor reception until up on the hill . 
i used it for a few days and felt worse . 
i shipped it back to amazon and bought a bag instead . 
i had read other reviews and figured i d give it a try anyways . 
being able to be good during the day and evil during the num_extend
i changed the rating from four stars to two . 
i made a few changes to the card settings in the configuration utility that came with the card . 
they both rock ,  and this game can just be skipped . 
it is not for everyday use or people . 
they of cores reimbursed me but why the huge difference from same company ?  let down . 
i do hope the exterior of this shoe holds up . 
i have always used wahl products and always had good experiences . 
this one with the stamp made in italy and sold for $ more expensive . 
gotta protect your hands so i would not recommend this . 
blue lizard num_num is not as good of ingredients as badger but still better than vanicream num_extend
technically ,  it should be possible for you to do this . 
i would have gotten more use from a $ toy than this . 
num_num stars for no solo singing and creepy voice . 
up close the figures are poorly painted and not even close to characters in the movie . 
not the exact kennel pictured ,  this shows the old style varikennel . 
i also found out that you cannot delete downloaded or transfer file on the device itself . 
on the other hand it is a good price . 
i was hoping to use this product to illuminate my desktop keyboard ,  which i use at night . 
not worth the money for the cost of the refills . 
the only redeeming quality is the smell :  it smells divine ,  like a tropical flower garden . 
i bought it but ended up throwing it away . 
it really was like one day it works ,  the next day it doesn t . 
they like other scratchers ,  but this one does nothing for them . 
the padding is excellent and the material breaths good . 
we bought two sets ,  and have num_num glasses left . 
this results in a noisy drive train that will skip gears often . 
i purchased num_extend one for my reg headlights and one for my fogs . 
i think its because the treats are too hard ,  rather than the taste . 
i purchase most of our dog equipment from amazon . 
so i have to get out the manual opener to finish the job . 
cvs didn t have coty powder  which is my favorite powder in the world  ,  so i picked this crap up . 
i received this on time ,  however ,  the waver does not work . 
now for num_num min he is breathing heavy ,  if he doesn t calm soon i ll be calling the vet . 
don t bother with the circular ones at all . 
the only good thing is the mini turkey baster they give you to do your own feedings . 
i have owned several timex ironman watches over the years . 
if you re looking for  sims in space !   ,  this is your game . 
but the case just wasn t durable and didn t fit properly . 
seems like rubbing paper over your nails but eventually it will work . 
i would advise potential buyers to consider this product a gamble at best . 
he still plays with the garage but it s not as much fun . 
anyways ,  my point is don t buy this game . 
the blood is everywhere ,  and it really takes the quote  fun  out of the game . 
this is nothing short of sabotaging our own economy for personal profit  more than  lower prices  .  .  .  .  .   . 
i am a complete litter slave until they come up with something that actually works . 
i ended up throwing the case in the trash . 
i used it to connect my ihome alarm clock to my iphone inside the otterbox . 
i m usually pretty satisfied with the design and quality of this company s products . 
i am male with size num_num feet ,  so buying an extended size sock that fits is critical . 
i wouldn t know about that ,  but i do know i m never buying any chebe products again . 
i bought it only based on amazon reviews and i really disappointed that this highly rated item is useless . 
i have three very large cats ,  and they have trouble fitting into the box . 
this feels like i m misting plain water on my hair . 
i tried to put on one of the gloves ,  the top partbroke off and snapped into . 
i would not recommend on any note variant . 
did not fit right inside of my ears they kept falling out and wouldn t stay in place . 
they are headphones that sit within your ear ,  but do not insert within the ear canal . 
this is a fine tool for very light use . 
i had to superglue it back on to stay . 
it doesn t close or stay closed so it s in a ziplock . 
i m not sure what game the other reviewers are playing ,  but this one is utter crap . 
i finally got the clips that cyclists use for their cuffs . 
i tried three times but couldn t get the machine to do anything . 
well ,  i loved num_extend and num_extend and i assumed this one would be just as good . 
i bought this along with it the first time . 
the taste is only slight more flavorful than water . 
good initial performance ,  and then these bloody energizer batteries can t hold a charge . 
i bought this because it was a great size and was inexpensive . 
well ,  at least the platter rotates and plays records .  .  . that s about it . 
i m using nikon ,  num_extend num_extend num_extend  because i will never ever sell this camera  . 
i can play the game fine up to the space age .  .  . who knows . 
good product ,  found it at a local flee market where the price was a lot cheaper . 
i have relaxed hair and perhaps it s not for my type of hair . 
this screen protector bubbles as soon as you put it on . 
as one reviewer mentioned ,  this is pretty lacking in any clams at all . 
further ,  it often leaves quite a few big chunks . 
thus ,  i offer a resounding one star for poor performance by sony . 
so i immediately came back to amazon and ordered another one . 
i ran clear water through it again and again . 
i found the beans stayed hard and the flavor was dull . 
they do not appear on your skin especially if you are of color . 
it s a dual bladed helicopter similar to the chinook . 
unless i can find a better way to apply this ,  i won t be using it . 
the cases r so slim that the discs r touching . 
true calm amino relaxer :  i tried this a few times and it didn t do anything for me . 
i think i will  regift  these at xmas time . 
no one will even believe they are fiestaware !  !  . 
look at one of the cheaper flash players . 
the worst part is ,  pur said it s not covered under warranty because it s a  wear and tear  item . 
amazon sent me replacements after contacting them ,  but they were the same . 
i bought these for my son to set up his first kitchen . 
however ,  the engraving is very shallow and in less than a year the engraving was worn almost completely away . 
seriously ,  they are not worth the effort of ordering and carrying around your neck . i sent them back . 
he isn t into towing it behind him  yet  but he does enjoy trying to rip off the back legs . 
this game came with the original nintendo system back in late num_extend
this is great fun when i m brewing coffee for dinner guests . 
very roomy cup with very thin coverage makes me feel very exposed . 
the crackers were your basic ritz type crackers and were as expected . 
but i am discarding this headphone for reasons stated above . 
this is not orange and tangerine juice; it s mainly apple and grape juice flavored with orange and tangerine . 
as i mentioned ,  though ,  connecting my ipod touch turned out to be painful . 
these oggi glasses are not at all of the same quality . 
i would have preferred that they send me a pillbox that actually worked . 
this means the speaker has to be in the back of the mounting plate for the gasket to work . 
i got these thinking all ipod cable were the same  or as good  . 
im just surprised at all the stellar reviews on amazon . 
i was getting them for my sister who has alzheimer s end stages . 
now it doesn t do any of those things . 
i tried it for the full num_num days to no avail . 
but i detest cruel treatment of any animal ,  even a mouse . 
the game is very predictable and is also very slow moving . 
it only toasted one side of the bread most of the time . 
i have called leapfrog on three separate occassions and that was even more of a disaster . 
i purchased a pair of these num_num months ago and have less than num_num miles on them . 
i had to go back to aveeno at night just so my skin wouldn t flake because of lifecell . 
terrible never had it in hand bad knife found out it was a ripoff not a good product . 
it does not snap together properly on my phone . 
i also found it difficult to mount on the glasses and helmet . 
the wizard was unable to get an address via dhcp ,  and so guessed that i use a static ip . 
we received the cars num_num version ,  which we already owned . 
i guess you can t expect a lot for under $
and yes ,  i followed the directions on the package . 
these boots didn t even last half the time as the first pair i bought him . 
if you are masculine guy with any kind of muscles please buy other brands with other styles . 
the coating appears to be a good quality surface . 
not at all what i was looking for . 
many states now limit phosphates to % in dishwasher detergent . 
as soon as i put the replacement bottle in ,  they drank with a vengeance . 
i make sun tea with it almost exclusively . 
i ve had two types of sangean radios of this size and i use them to fall asleep at night . 
seriously ,  if hitler were around today ,  this would be his favorite soup . 
the handle on my bottle broke from the body because the weld spot gave up . 
there is only num_num ounces to a box . 
it has edges that can tear into your roof so i had to do some taping . 
good concept but does not work at all with hair of any thickness . 
the only problem i have is with usability . 
that would make num_num cost $ and they want to charge $ this is simply outrageous . 
i was parked at a truck stop in the cincinnati oh area . 
it mostly taste like a two day old cup of cold coffee . 
the grill marks on the top are very shallow ,  making this device better for panini than for grilling meat . 
worked great !  the first time i tried it ,  i was very impressed with how well it charges . 
i bought these insulated bottles to keep some cold water at hand when on my long rides . 
although you have to pay for the shipping back to them . 
its size isn t all that much bigger than some other modern keyboards i have used . 
i was a little concerned reading the reviews before i purchased . 
i would never pay $ as it is no where near worth $
however ,  i can t begin to describe how much i hate this paper . 
i loved how it was perfectly slim ,  and had a lovely pearly finish . 
i tried them ,  the combo of the acne fighting ingredients proved too strong for my skin . 
we bought these sheets ,  of course ,  based on the recommendations from consumer reports . 
this is by far the most disgusting chocoate gluten free bar i have ever eaten . 
so instead ,  i ordered the number one on amazon :  a mr coffee with all the features this one has . 
i will not buy this food for my dog . 
both said they could not hear me for the roar in the background . 
hard shifts ,  missed shifts . just not for my num_num cylinder push rod num_num stroke num_extend wet clutch . 
i like these ,  but cheaper to buy a grocery store or walmart brand for less . 
i will definitely not be purchasing this product again . 
i cant for the life of me understand how they got such good reviews . 
i am very serious about my facial care in order to prevent present and future wrinkles . 
using the same moves from the first title . 
so what if it s  organic  ?  it tastes terrible . 
had the description been detailed about the cup ,  i would never have ordered it . 
obviously everyone s tastes are different ,  so just because i didn t like this doesn t mean you won t . 
i had to do a force close after the phone would not turn on completely . 
bad latches ,  dont buy this if you want it to last . 
it did make the skin under my eyes soft ,  so that was a plus . 
you can get about % battery out of it which is decent enough considering the price for this case . 
the measurement instructions discuss the width of the paw but not the height or thickness . 
i purchased this whistle for my grandson and was very disappointing . 
make your own stylus ,  and i bet yours will work better than the pogo ,  too . 
i bought num_num of these ,  and it seemed ok so i bought another . 
it also gets very hot ,  even on the lowest temperature . 
i tried this cb with a num_num inch antenna and it hardly got out a half mile . 
once i finally got it on it was slanted side ways . 
also ,  it comes in a sharp wooden box that must be disposed of immediately . 
this wasn t at all like the madras lentils enjoyed at indian restaurants . 
it ends up taking up more space than creating . 
looked like the cat in the hat and utterly ridiculous . 
i have absolutely no clue what that was all about . 
we ll give that a try ,  and see if he will come around . 
my main problems are ,  firstly ,  that the tracks seemed to be created at random . 
another thing is that i think the is a  bug  when receiving cjk txt messages . 
a main character with amnesia ?  !  and they just left it that way ?  the main character never even had presence . 
a nifty way to get around perhaps ,  but rather clumsy in design overall . 
my daughter wanted this so much for her birthday . 
i didn t have much luck with this product . 
we bought a new battery ,  thinking that was the problem ,  but that didn t help . 
this is celebrating the original game s num_extend annaversary ?  wow sega ,  you must hate sonic . 
the creators of this game should be ashamed of themselves !  !  . 
i have other headsets ,  but apparently this one has poor support . 
i finally had to take a $ loss and trade that pos in for a new one  . 
i bought this face trimmer looking to upgrade . 
lots of musk ,  and it was a very masculine musk . 
even yogurt doesn t hide the wet cardboard taste . fresh product is probably fine ,  but this stinks  literally !   . 
amazon s customer service is excellent ,  so i m getting a replacement router delivered early this week . 
i am afraid this one does not work either . 
first of all this heating pad is great . 
i m saying this after receiving many dozen of them so this is not a one bad run deal . 
i can t believe the good reviews this thing is getting . 
i think the seller ,  skindirect  ,  sent me a used bottle . 
don , t get me wrong i am not prejudice in any way . 
if you are susceptible to clotting or other vascular traumas ,  be very careful about products based on vitamin k . 
i thought i would give this a try; maybe it would taste so bad he would stop . 
don t waste your money ,  and same goes for the psp and ds lite versions of the starter kit . 
it may as well have been a placebo . 
i just opened the package and they sent me square screens . 
it s not worth the risk and it definitely puts more toxic junk into their systems . merrick is not great either . 
never been so disappointed with a lip product . 
i thought that these bars were very tasty if a bit on the expensive side . 
after making this suggestion ,  he said goodbye and hung up in the middle of the conversation . 
but come on ?  the gba sp was just like that . 
there are two types of men in this world . 
i have rubbed it wth meat and washed it ,  but it still smells strange . 
stay away from it . update :  this is completely dead now . 
way too much bass ,  really muffled mids ,  and no highs ,  no clarity . 
somewhat noisy ,  and the timer  sliding tab  that controls the thickness of the grinds is poorly designed . 
but i want to get something better and quieter . 
it is supposed to be a deterrent for squirrels who sit on the bar because they weigh too much . 
also ,  seems it took a long time to get here from china . 
this lacer is just another black color nail polish . 
this app tries to be too hip for its own good . 
the corn is fully popped before the butter begins to melt . 
sweatshirt is reasonable quality; however ,  not nearly as described . 
the default ip address does not come with the manual . the manual does not mention a default ip address . 
very inexpensive ,  so one should not expect much . 
but i noticed many other reviewers commented on the loud noise this pump produces . 
an utter waste of time and money ,  and i bought it for only num_extend
there is no way you could put makeup over this and have it look good . 
plus ,  the projects num_extend total  are completed in and a short time . 
this lens ,  if put to good use in the field ,  would literally fall apart . 
if you re a busy person ,  save the money and get yourself a massage instead . 
terrible product not worth the calories at all !  . 
i will not be buying yet another cook book . 
i m sure it fits some cups ,  just not any that i use . 
i feel like you are better of buying a drug store liner . 
unless you are certain ,  just get a circular polarizing filter . there are some digital circular polarizers on the market . 
i could not reattach it since the very thin wires also broke away from their solder joints . 
sorry i wasted money on num_num cases of this stuff . 
i don t know if this is a problem with the filter or the lens but i m disappointed . 
it makes the game a giant mush without any order to it . 
i m looking for something similar with better quality . 
rushed the case to the production line without getting the proper dimensions or b . 
i called line num_num and they determined it was bad so they opened a  ticket  . 
in the new versions of these ,  which i received ,  only the dog and cat make realistic sounds . 
the taste of the milk is reall off . 
i usually love lu cookies ,  but these definitely disappoint . 
only advantage is that it smaller than a dipole and not as unsightly . 
now take that taste and add fizz  why  to it and you have one gross beverage . 
i bought this scale to go on my kitchen counter for when i pack and freeze meat . 
also leaves a white coating on my hair that looks like dandruff and coats my hair brush . 
once the watch gets an initial wind ,  it supposed to be able to wind itself as you move around . 
i bought this thing from a local store and i have to say that it is pretty darned awful . 
i ended up getting some mild  and expensive  pain pills from the vet to help him while he recovers . 
we are now waiting to see what will be done . 
i was very eager to get it home and set it up . 
i used it until i wore it out . 
a person shouldn t have to do this ,  so i can t recommend it anymore . 
don t buy this cheap little piece of garbage it s not worth the clicking . 
this writes very light and skips a little bit . 
i will not purchase this item from this supplier again . 
not to mention it just becomes tiresome after the num_extend num_extend
i was carving a tender roast the other day and my knife just stopped working . 
the industrial designer who designed this at hoover earns an  f  . 
this game features the worst controls i have ever seen in any game . 
after num_num minutes of continuous use it becomes quite hot  not wram  around the battery compartment area . 
to top it off i had to pay to return them to get them replaced . 
this occurs even when i use just the bowl and a spoon to mix . 
this tool is supposed to be used to pull the cranks together so that they seat onto the bearings . 
however the new jabra sone bluetooth headset does not meet the standards of jabra . 
it also did the opposite for me regarding sleep . 
thanks to the glorious idea that is  playstation greatest hits  ,  this pos was only num_extend
is also extremely overpriced for what amounts to a think piece of plastic wrap . 
they re also more expensive than clumping cat litter . 
i was able to fix the file system  losing all of the data  . 
i have trouble even using these to cook . 
i held my hand on it for over a minute and it was just barley changing . 
they are still usable ,  they are just fragile . 
it comes in a cute little bag ,  but they fit into a plastic insert . 
and so ended the first  and last  half hour of using this cheap piece of garbage . 
supposedly dark cloud num_num  aka dark chronicle  fixes all the problems this game has . 
when i put a battery into the charger ,  it just blinks a red light without charging . 
i never take my watches off ,  which has never been a problem with trusty ol  timex expeditions . 
the john deere has realistic sounds and actually sounds like a real mower . 
during the day i have to combine it with another lipstick for it to work . 
i typically like avia ,  but these are so uncomfortable they aren t even used for garden shoes . 
energizer has finally discontinued the num_extend series ,  presumably due to massive complaints . 
i guess if you want them to stick you need to apply super glue . 
poop off bird cage cleaner is much better as an enzyme cleaner and it smells great . 
i lost the instructions ,  so now every day at num_extend pm the damn thing goes off . 
it barely works on the second floor of our house . 
also ,  the spray nozzle seemed to be stuck and nothing comes out of it . 
i would give this mixer num_num stars if it was an option . 
they are stained by whatever aromatic oils the manifacturer used and look unattractive . 
i ll use these for a while ,  but won t buy more . 
maybe dust away eyeshadow fallout ,  but that s num_extend
i suppose the life expectancy of this toy depends on your dog . 
in the first game ,  you had gorgeous dungeons such as dorn s deep and the vale of shadows to explore . 
the rub is that it cost me over $ to return ship the product to sony . 
this style does not say if it is sandalfoot or reinforced toe .  .  . couldn t buy because of that . 
they travel all over the continenct searching for these artifacts . 
most of the symptoms of bodily stress i ve been experiencing started the same day i first took this supplement . 
they were pretty comfortable for the most part . 
i m so annoyed by this ,  it has tainted my whole view of the game . 
knowing that it was % cotton ,  i ordered a size larger than i normally wear . 
in fact ,  most wrestlers lack detail altogether and look about as generic as possible . 
two observations that are outside of the game . 
it doesn t move unless it s on a very hard flat surface . 
i ve been wanting to try coconut water for a long time . 
hence whenever you touched or moved the cable ,  it is annoying loud noise in the ear . 
i d describe it as a sickeningly sweet syrup with very little carbonation added . 
i ll contact the seller and see what they can do for me . 
i walk num_extend miles with a friend daily . 
before i bought this ,  i read the reviews . 
it was wonderful while it lasted but now it s no different from any other towel holder . 
all the way around i felt like i got screwed . 
after i ran out of the num_num bricks ,  i also stopped getting the runs and stomach pains every morning . 
we were on vacation ,  and i had to cross a busy road to get to the beach . 
i was very excited to order this teapot but had problems with the infuser being broken upon receiving it . 
medal of honor :  underground sports the best sounds in any game i ve ever heard . 
but ,  it didn t help the hair on my head in any way ,  though it made my skin extra smooth . 
i have to take my time and resist the urge to gag ,  you know ,  mind over matter thing . 
phone call log showing all the calls and messages ,  need to fliter it every num_extend
i always use cheats after i get bored with the normal game to add some extra spice . 
i ve always thought wilton products to be above average quality ,  but i m learning differently .  .  .  . it was a costly lesson . 
i laugh now that the box claims to be even tastier ,  so before they must have tasted like ass . 
i  upgraded  to this expansion after about num_num months of rise of nations . 
i checked it out and the mouse is fine . 
i was not pleased with the results that i had with it . 
not a crisp natural taste ,  and way too sweet for me . 
this is a fragrance oil ,  not essential oil . 
the tubes are heavy duty but the valve stems not so much . 
purchased product from seller euro sale and the product was not legitimate and was a bootleg . 
i reviewed both of these cases ,  as well ,  if you re interested . 
they also stick well and stay put through the night . 
we returned the item for a refund and purchased a different thermometer . 
but ,  and it s a big but ,  it feels huge in your pocket . 
all the wrestlers fly so high you think they were on speed or something like that . 
on the flip side ,  it does not live up to it s claims . 
did not work for either my phone or my sisters ,  even though they were listed as compatible . 
you can t do events unless the clock is exactly at the right time . 
even now ,  over two weeks after removing the cushion from its box ,  i can still smell it . 
all of the shears are very cheaply made . 
it looks like it was one of the last of the bunch . 
the mugs that come with this set are sturdy and usable . 
when i saw these on amazon and looked over the reviews ,  thought these must be pretty tasty also . 
this has to be the most overrated garbage i ve ever played . 
the fishing line like connection ripped out and now we are just down to the mouse . 
and at the end of day num_extend it was hazardous to keep around ,  so i tossed it . 
once they become competitively priced on amazon ,  i ll be delighted to order them here . 
had to return the first one as the door would not close had a big crack letting heat out . 
i would put it in her food and she didn t care for it . 
yes ,  suddenly the watch would almost fall off my hand . 
if anyone knows how to do that ,  i would appreciate knowing . 
my daughter was just frustrated with this toy . 
it will not put your phone into dock mode etc . 
i ve taken these religiously for an entire month . 
the mixture was worse than just making black beans only soup from store bought beans . 
it s a game ultimately lacking in any depth to be really rewarding to play . 
i wouldn t buy them again ,  the concept if great but not for me . 
the rifle can be loaded ,  cocked ,  and fired with the lock still in place . 
most of the truckers run old cobra num_extend unidens ,  galaxies ,  strykers ,  and so on . 
however ,  the stuff tasted bad and the consistency reminded me of wallpaper paste . 
you will be sorry . hoover has sold their company num_num times in the last num_num years . 
i m actually disappointed that amazon is selling this directly . 
i m not sure i would be interested due to the negatives i refer to earlier . 
i did not put it on but ,  seems like it gives you a soft recoil experience . 
i reviewed this product under the num_extend ounce refill . 
i thought these would be great for one of my cats ,  who loves curled up pipe cleaners . 
i had red wine stains on my teeth . 
it s all fancy packaging ,  but doesn t add much to the experience ,  if you know what i mean . 
i shouldn t have to complain about walking ,  but it is alot like resident evil . 
i also didn t really taste  caramel  ,  which surprised me given werther s mainstay product is a caramel candy . 
i have num_num shih tzu s and have twice ordered num_extend bottles at a time . 
while i have concerns regarding how long this oxo product will last ,  it s easier to learn to use . 
i don t understand how they can do that . 
i m certain that the holder is exactly as it should be ,  however ,  the product description is wrong . 
i don t have especially sensitive skin ,  but it is dry . 
the other elephant was fine ,  until the tank cracked through our own fault . 
they pull my hair out ,  maybe because it is so long idk . 
at least i didn t have to shower . i greatly prefer other brands of massage oils that don t heat or cool . 
without the software installation ,  the linksys just defaults to no password needed . 
toys are supposed to be be fun not frustrating . 
i was very disappointed with the enemies in this game . 
after giving this one to my sister ,  i ordered myself a logitech num_extend
save your money and get a better one . 
i expect something this expensive  i paid well over num_num for it  to last for many years . 
i have never experienced this issue with any other filter that i own . 
if you don t want your screen to scratch ,  take good care of it ,  because these won t help . 
crittercord cord protector does do the job but at better than $ a foot it is way too expensive . 
seriously if you want a good time go get a psp ,  they know what the customer wants . 
with out any num_extend season is soooo boaring . 
this is the first disappointment in a carhartt item in tall . 
i squirted this mio liquid into a glass of cold water and was hoping for the best . 
this product wasn t great ,  it was more of an expensive suppository than a massager . 
no hold !  no matter how much i used ,  or the way i used it .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . nada . 
it was not the eggplant purple i thought it was . 
chose the two star rating  i don t like it  because these headphones would not stay on my head . 
i don t think they will last long and they are not what i expected . 
i set my camera up on it and tried the different functions . 
i messed with the laptop and the tv for two hours before swapping the cables . 
the problems haven t occurred with other brands of filters on the same lens . 
saving a few bucks really isn t worth potentially damaging the phone . 
let me first start off with the sizing . 
i did not research this one because i was happy with my previous palms . 
my use also coincided with the end of winter ,  so the operating temperatures can account for the improvements ,  too . 
this game isn t even worth anyones time or money . 
i got these markers for my num_num month old . 
i definitely recommend trying different lines of the organix products . 
cascadian farms parent company contributed to the millions spent to defeat the simple label gmo prop num_num in california . 
now ,  remember ,  on num_extend the monitor read it as low . 
with all the great reviews ,  i thought i would give it a try . 
that is ,  unless it is a  dud  rhodiola that has little or no effect . 
does not mix well at all ,  lots of nasty sediment at bottom of cup . 
had to contact vet again and she put him on steroid eye drops to put in his nose . 
i bought the game ,  based on all the hype about num_extend and num_extend for vista . 
i bought two for my mom and one for myself to test different varieties of tomatoes . 
the pieces were just too hard for her to hold . 
this product gets narrower at the bottom which prevents the smartphone from fitting inside of it . 
i would never dare to use this on a glass ,  like the advertisement shows . 
i ve never had such a bad out of the box screen protector experience . 
i feel like i wasted a lot of money . 
if you want something to target shoot or plink with ,  i suggest you get something else . 
the wax only removed a couple of hairs and then crumbled off . 
i seem to leave a heavy residue in my hair and causes my scalp to itch . 
i know what good food is and especially italian food since i make it . 
it holds a generous amount of water ,  the bottle is so attractive ,  and it easily comes apart for cleaning . 
i got a mophie powerstation duo instead just in case there is another power outage . 
switched to mac ?  switch back . i built an num_extend network for the pcs in my house . 
upss also have surge supression and some simple metering if you want those features . 
only problem with them is the phone charger is hard to connect past the lip on the bottom . 
it is only the colored part of the orange peel . 
the material is a lot lighter and cheaper than what i remember too . 
all i can smell is the super ,  overpowering smell of ice cream . 
from num_extend to num_extend photos were acceptable but not stunning . 
the quality of the wool is very cheap . 
after num_num washings ,  even in my lingerie bag on gentle it fell apart . 
the top part won t stay connected to the bottom after putting the batteries inside . 
i am not willing to try it again . 
i know all about the dangers of power surges ,  so i connected the monitor to a quality surge protector . 
the sound quality is worse than am radio . 
% of the time ,  the item will be price better at amazon . 
this is the best bluetooth headset i ve owned in terms of comfort and sound quality . 
but the program is full of bugs and should never have been released in this condition . 
i guess the first thing i ll say is that i got jedi academy before i got this game . 
it runs on num_num c batteries  not included  and activates when you slide and hold the button . 
they are definitely the smallest set you can buy . 
i was in so much pain and so sick i thought i had an ulcer . 
these are man scissors and i have never feared breaking them . 
perhaps your lovey will like them . amazon carries other flavors ,  but i am hesitating . 
even inside num_num feet it isn t all that great . 
even with a new unit and the latest software upgrade ,  this router is very unreliable . 
i have washed these towels several times and i cannot get them to stop shedding like a dog . 
this is the worst shampoo i have used in my entire life . 
very flimsy not much protection for the phone but cute . 
go buy some melissa and doug stuff instead and the kids will get more play time out of it . 
it takes me about two hours to get five boxes washed out ,  sanitized and refilled . 
these are nice ,  warm socks ,  but i don t feel any support whatsoever . 
all three products i bought taste very awful and worst food i have ever ate so far . 
she told me that the late num_extend speakers sounded alot better than the new ones . 
i d say it works num_num out of num_num attempts . 
this lens is worth about what you pay for it . 
but the thing is that they catch very few moths . 
to sum it all up ,  the apple ipod has many design flaws ,  simple as that . 
i m giving it two stars because if your dog is not a heavy duty chewer ,  it might be okay . 
evidently quality control was asleep at the wheel when they let this product slip out to the public . 
i gave it num_num stars instead of one ,  because it would probably work pretty well for something tiny . 
it should ve been pulled off the market as a faulty product . 
more amusing ,  even the friendlies have a problem locking on correctly and then they end up killing each other . 
the headset beeps in my ear everytime the connection is lost and it happens often . 
the music this thing plays is really horrible ,  it sounds like basic midi stuff . 
i used to own this seiko black monster . 
i can t tell you more than this is just yicky . 
all these rpgs were simple ,  yet for some reason delightful to play . 
let me start off by saying i am a very caffeine sensitive person . 
my kitten jumps from the litter box to the floor to avoid stepping on this . 
i thought this would be handy to pick up small sewing items ,  like thread ,  pins ,  etc . 
i take points off for that ,  just so you will know  . 
well ,  i m using an nvidia card ,  which was fine with mmc num_extend
i knew this going in ,  but even i was suprised to see how flimsy it was in person . 
haven t tried dawn of mana ,  but was told to stay far far away from it . 
i have been using lush henna noir since march num_num probably ever num_num months or so . 
at the price and promotion of these phones ,  much is left to be desired . 
i m not talking about bending a little ,  the seat is junk in num_num mild xc rides . 
search the net and you will see more people have this issue . 
i was looking to trigger the lights with my digital camera . 
the smell is nice ,  and not too weak or strong ,  and shave quality is alright . 
i fear that dead or alive and soul calibur may have spoiled me though . 
i contacted the seller and they refused to refund me . 
no wonder they charge $ a case ,  they know they will be replacing it a few times . 
at the very least ,  do a patch test before putting it over your whole face . 
it should be in a tube or squeeze bottle . 
no matter what or how i tried ,  the liquid just ran down the side of the cup . 
it s like every other encounter is a boss monster . 
for instance the pressure meters or the face off setups don t always resond to your input . 
cable length didn t appear to make any difference as mentioned in another review . 
this is one of those instances where you get what you pay for . 
and then you can plug in the router . 
i ve bought it for passat and it not quite working . 
i would not consider myself as a hard core audiophile but i am certainly headed that way . 
this product is not well built or long lasting . 
for a toddler it works great ,  but it is also very noisy . 
best thing is the new anker battery i got fits the mobile charger so that s good . 
we wanted to better monitor the bleeding ,  and see if he was  dripping  blood when out of his crate . 
so i doubt we ll be ordering this in the future . 
we ve had a lot of plastic crates over the years and this one is one of the worst . 
we returned this and bought the classic fisher price version . 
i first started purchasing it because it was soy free . 
you really don t get very much for the cost you pay . 
i will not ever again buy nyx products . 
if your time has any value ,  this is a better option . 
after showering ,  this leaves a nasty residue all over my skin . 
my mom has a black one from walmart that i actually like better . 
i would say it s a waste of money for num_num days . 
the ka could only manage double and the batter wasn t as airy . 
i m going tho miss it to be honest . 
instead of this item ,  i suggest a portable dvd player . 
these books were all first available around nov . 
the lather itself is thick ,  rich ,  and luxurious . 
it s awesome ,  safe and my skin isn t dry and flaky from the sulfur like it was before . 
i liken them more to long johns than sweatpants . 
after reading the positive reviews of this mattress ,  i decided to purchase it for my spare bedroom . 
i ordered the premium indigo and the color is a lot lighter than pictured . 
i wish dry pak would make this a little larger because the waist strap is awesome . 
i tried using this in my toddlers ears and they kept falling off . 
i don t know what the scent is ,  but it s not a good one and it s not relaxing . 
but low reliability makes this an expenisive option . 
its unfortunate the item did not work . amazon was fast in refunding the balance on cc . 
gone are other game modes :  last man standing ,  etc . 
when the num_extend arrived ,  they were % cotton ,  contrary to what amazon lists in the product description . 
the amount of air that it moves is marginal at best . 
there are no handles on the egg holding tray ,  and it s metal besides . 
all in all i was very uphappy with this eyeliner . 
each time they arrived dark colored ,  spoiled taste ,  rancid ,  and rotten . 
what was sent was some weird unit with a reverse curvature . 
it is too bad you can t rate something less than one star . total junk !  doesn t fit well ,  fragile ,  came broken . 
i threw it away .  .  . very unhappy at kuhn rikon who made my wonderful pressure cookers . 
i had heard this really worked for relaxation . 
these look cheaply made and weigh next to nothing . 
the pump foot valve retention plug broke before i could get it wet with fuel . 
the num_extend one bowed up over the main button on the front making it difficult the push it down . 
i would never pay money for this set . 
i m a size meduim and ordered a large thinking it was in jr . 
the handle on my num_num cup broke within the first year . 
i purchased two tubes ,  both blew up within a week . 
take cheapo watches that won t attrach attention or announce you as a rich target . 
the case arrived and it did not fit my grand daughter phone she was so disappointed . 
it s not a terrible game ,  yet it s not a terribly fun game either . 
i decided to try the shock on me which i should have done in the first place . 
signal is always week i try to move it try to adjust the settings but nothing . 
if you are looking for a good adventure game ,  get zelda . 
it still works ,  but i think the battery is dying . 
no one seems to get wet ,  but it s depressing . 
she told me it fell apart and she tossed it out . 
most people don t care and think it s just fine . 
do not waste your money on this item . 
the one i received was scratched to heck and scuffed like no other . 
she looks at me like i had pulled a mean trick on her . 
billy s missions are all about stealth and running like a coward . 
the opposite is true of the garmin dash mount; which cost about the same as the little bag . 
fortunately it didn t seem to leave any discoloration on my skin . 
i had to return this modem and purchase a zoom num_extend
i recently found out its maker ,  purina ,  utilizes animal testing for its products . 
i went by the reviews and went up a size . 
that is all there is to these packets ,  noodles and sauce . la choy chow mein is % tastier . 
unfortunately this mat doesn t live up to the hype . 
this renders the display all but unreadable except in bright sunlight . 
this is especially unfortunate since skippy already sells its  natural  peanut butter in num_extend jars . 
i couldn t even finish one game because i was so horrified at what i was seeing on screen . 
from the moment i got this product it was broken . 
in record time in fact as this game has the worse music my poor ears have ever come across . 
they really need to rethink the formula on this lilac stuff as it really does stink ,  literally . 
do these things work ?  either the ones i received are defective or it s a highly overrated product . 
exactly half of them were num_extend tall and the num_extend tall ones were completely anemic . 
my hubby could smell me a mile away . 
if you want to get a wwf game ,  buy smackdown num_num for playstation and enjoy  !  !  !  . 
dont worry you can win every time because the opponent doesnt move . 
however ,  i believe that a remote controlled car ,  helicopter ,  plane ,  etc .  ,  would be more fun ,  educational and productive . 
finally ,  the game actually copies all of its cutscenes as avi files onto your computer during installation . 
for dummies  gives you arrows on where to go if you get lost  . 
it s pretty good ,  better than the usual num_extend phillips drivers . 
that said ,  i reserve the right to change my opinion should the second unit function properly . 
i think i received a bad batch  there s no expiration date  . 
i ve enjoyed all of the resident evil games except this one . 
now i am not even sure if i would try it out once . 
i don t like it because it took me num_num minutes to get it to stay together . 
i kept applying it hoping that eventually i would start seeing results but nope ,  i didn t . 
it is best for blow drying versus hot curlers or flat irons . 
it basically will not hold up to any serious mixing requirement . 
so if you haven t gotten this game and don t know why you haven t ,  now you know . 
i m pretty disappointed in melissa and doug for putting their name on this . 
i threw this brush away pretty quickly after receiving it . 
not cool !  .  .  . ok so here is probably the most irritating thing in the game and the deal breaker for me . 
the seat is too shallow for any dog over num_num pounds to sit in . 
that stuff contains isopropyl alcohol ,  so i know it can clean almost anything . 
this was the quickest that any cat toy has broken that i have purchased . 
again my copy is back on the store shelf . 
i have a supplement regiment which i have been faithful to since num_extend
they are very slow and after an hour of charge the level is maximum % increase . 
so it was not enough support toward the front of my foot . 
could it be possible i would need a size num_num to get the right fit ?  i would never know . 
the larger russet potatoes created a huge problem for this cutter . 
toolkit was included and instructions can be found at ifixit . 
reality is this could be just % coconut water or less !  who knows . 
to realize that the cats had an allergic reaction ,  contact dermatitis from the plastic . 
they were too small and you were not able to replace them with a larger size . 
perhaps this would be a better fit for cold climates ,  but not hot temps . 
luckily i tried these at home before going out into public . 
where will it end ?  oh !  num_num minutes into the call the line went dead . 
it s a few dollars more expensive but well worth it if you really care about your bunny . 
it s my own fault for not looking at the specifications . 
i don t see this as a con; in fact ,  if you have kids ,  this is a pro . 
a bit of delicate task ,  considering we re allergic . 
i will never recommend a weber product again ,  nor will anyone i know purchase another weber product . 
in summary i will get twice as much juice  about num_num mah for $ vs . 
the bosses in this game give me nightmares !  !  !  !  !  !  !  . 
it s too demanding on time and far too repetitive for me . 
overall i think it is annoying and would recommend getting a different abc toy . 
kids seem to prefer that over something bulky . 
it worked fine for my purposes ,  but if you want something that looks real ,  this is not it . 
maybe this is good cat nip for another cat but it didn t affect mine at all . 
think i will try another hipster brand in the future . 
after that waste of programming code ,  you re allowed to continue on . 
unrefined is dependent upon the intention or use of the oil . 
however ,  to me it feels like less than num_extend
i don t understand why philosophy can t make this stuff smell better . 
but i can t use the usb connection anymore ,  and i only got the firewire connection to work once . 
maybe it works better with mountain bike tires which have much lower pressure than road tires . 
there was a lot of wandering around learning about different abilities . 
the sound is simply too poor to make this suitable for any sort of serious music listening . 
after a few uses it doesn t look clean . 
ups will not pick up from my residence unless i am present to hand it to them . 
after several tries ,  we haven t figured out how to use this adapter with our computer . 
no one went near it ,  so i out treats in it to entice them . 
i have a curvy shape and this made me look flat and boyish . 
i tried the dogs next door and a friend s dog and got the same reaction . 
read others tips and still had no luck . 
they are the only product in this pack that i continued to buy afterward . 
real crisp and clear ,  but over a period of a month ,  little lines started showing up in my recordings . 
put too much on ,  and there was an excessive greasy buildup . not for me . 
plus it took a really long time to get to my house . 
this was unfixable so i sent it back for a refund . 
and unless you hide a lot and  rest  you will die ,  and reset a lot . 
neither the tilting or the panning is particularly smooth . 
reminds me of lemon cleaner in scent ,  especially . 
the quality can even differ from each individual disk ,  instead of per batch like with most disks . 
so ,  i ve got a used item from adorama again . 
the edger function did not work well for me . 
after a few tries they got it to connect . 
the first jar i bought was way too dark for me . 
not two inch high ,  ten inch long strips that would have kept the tintanic from leaking . 
i would not recommend these unless you plan on replacing it every few months . 
in fact ,  compared to the more recent ones this one is really outdated and poor . 
but the controls system is the worst system i ve ever used . 
get mediarama and don t get nasty spells like hama ,  mudo and so on . 
i played ,  played ,  and played that silly game ,  with it s cute num_num bit graphics ,  as if i were possessed . 
it goes from cable modem to ooma  voip  to apple extreme  dhcp server  to this switch . 
the flavor was awful and the texture was really not beneficial to what i would consider stage num_num foods . 
after an hour of trying to get this to work ,  i gave up . 
yummy ! i would never knowingly feed a dog ingredients i can t pronounce or don t know the meaning of . 
the tablets have a different taste and texture than before . 
per the instructions the removal of the release paper exposes the adhesive on the thermometer portion . 
this not only looks awkward; it feels awkward . 
after reading the great reviews on here for this product i figured i would give it a try . 
most cars you won t want to drive anyway . 
the chrome border is very exposed and still prone to scratches . 
they got frustrated when the pump stopped working . 
the uppers are very stiff ,  nearly rigid ,  and the front edges dug painfully into the tops of my feet . 
plus ,  if it s a game ,  then it s a bad game . 
it also drops calls like crazy here in manhattan . 
the battery is great for the first num_num months . 
i thought this was a defect ,  but that s how it s designed . 
finally gave way and broke in less than a month . 
they had this on special at a local market ,  so i thought i d give it a try . 
really ,  guys ?  being able to successfully belt feed a machine gun while firing is a desirable skill . 
the suggested serving is num_num squeeze per num_extend serving so i tried that at first in my water bottle . 
i use one part chocolate to num_num or num_num parts sugar . 
at first i thought they were the greatest thing under the sun for travel . 
this unit was well built in every way except one . 
i have a small flip phone and it fits nicely along with a single car key . 
i am patient ,  willing to do what is necessary ,  and will follow your advice to the letter . 
i was really excited to get the healthy infusions pro straightener by wahl . 
i was hoping to recreate the feel of the one i loved so much . 
as i wear glasses i need to fold that cover down to allow my eyeglasses to touch the lens . 
the rad mode allowed you to spot objects you could break ,  move or do something with . 
does not feel like cotton probably due to some chemical put on it . 
after num_num nights my neck hurt and not enough support for your head . 
this seat is very well made ,  and when you feel it with your hands ,  is firm but cushioned . 
the role is about to change anyway  jude law anyone  . 
they don t really have much to say ,  either . 
i think they are worth about $ less than i bought them for . 
i ordered the same size as always but these are way too large . 
it did drop right into my kimber cdpii . 
these are very small sizes ,  probably worth thre money ,  but they weren t very moisturizing . 
i bought this thinking it would work better than my old one . 
to me ,  these don t taste at all like licorice and not much like pomegranate . 
however ,  after the second time i folded it the  joints  became loose and it wiggled when i used it . 
at that point i through it away .  .  . do not buy these toys . 
the flimsy cover that it comes with is not sufficient . 
i have used them for a very long time . 
the filter itself is a piece of work to clean . 
yesterday i wanted to liquify some cooked potatoes for soup . 
conclusion :  these homedics massagers can only be bought in the usa . 
you aimed and fired at a certain amount of enemies before they killed ,  passed ,  or stole from you . 
there are six characters and only one  sonic  is decent . 
there are kids in the game and normal people . 
if it hadn t exploded i would have been worried that the seal was broken in transit . 
i was very very dissapointed in this product . 
they charging more money than others and you will get the same fisher price model . 
this didn t work for multiple devices that require at least num_extend output . 
croix with a zipper pull completely broken off . 
it s made of flimsy plastic that twists and bends if the front sight is really tight . 
if only this game was easier it might be fun ,  buts its not easy or much fun either . 
if anyone wants mine ,  just email me .  .  . im selling it on here for cheap now . 
moreover ,  there is no sliding scale of your covert or overt status . 
it takes a lot of muscle and time ,  which is what it was meant to save . 
i thought this game would be similar to the sims num_num and the sims bustin out . 
this headset works well and is a good value ,  but the fit is a constant problem . 
i was looking for head phones with a usb connection to use with dragon . 
i d had one that worked great for num_num years . 
until i sat down and there were these huge bulges on both my sides . 
i would like to know who thought of that brilliant design ? food does fall down into little cracks and crevices . 
i have an all black pair and they fit great . 
i ve had about num_num of these type of grills ,  a few of them george foreman . 
two had dark spots ,  swirls and blemishes ,  again on the front of the pearls . 
i viewed the customer video and tips before trying ,  so i knew the tricks to make it work . 
i ve seen num_extend games that look better than this . 
i got one for my generation num_num glock num_num and expected the same results but was disappointed . 
and the main ink display isn t dark enough . 
the router worked num_num whole day and died jan num_extend
i washed my face twice a day with step one and followed it with step two each time . 
just me copying files over to it ,  and the battery ran out of juice . 
the lotion was very watery and when i put it on my skin there was no hydrating effect . 
i read a lot of glowing reviews for this box . 
if these observations don t turn you off ,  drink up and enjoy !  . 
nevertheless to say ,  this is not neat and not so safe . 
so ,  what went wrong ?  well ,  let me go through the game . first the story . 
but the actually build and quality of the truck is very cheap and flimsy . 
even the updates haven t brought these phones to where they should be as far as reliability . 
pros :  very durable son liked it since it was introduced early on and he didn t have many other options . 
the battery was charged ,  it just would work for a few seconds and then stop . 
i also found this makeup very difficult to remove . 
i noticed a difference right away between the tablets and the capsules . 
it doesn t work on a lot of phones .  .  .  . and i don t know why . 
maybe just include a few corner pieces . that said ,  this stuff works great . 
buy it ,  just don t expect more out of it than it can provide . 
i ve had much better experiences with hape s peg puzzles ,  and i would recommend them highly . 
i like crisp ,  clean scents and this is not that . 
those who do already own them can just save ten bucks . 
wow this thing gives me an instant headache . 
amazon refunded my purchase price ,  and unfortunately i was unable to order the product with a reasonable expiration date . 
we have to swipe repeatedly to get it to the left side of the screen . 
this item sounded so good in previous reviews . 
i ve visited factories in china years ago and recognized the odor immediately . 
i drank so much water in fact ,  that i constantly kept running to the bathroom so often . 
the design started rubbing off within days of purchasing it . 
i really don t like not have a little more control over height . 
it said i needed to clean my lens contacts ,  so i did . 
you d be better off using a grill or going to the grocery store to buy a rotisserie chicken . 
the shape and size are absolutely perfect but the interior of the pan is unbelievably rough . 
it still tasted nice ,  but i felt seriously ripped off given the price . 
what a waste of money and time !  the microphone part stopped working after just a couple of months . 
i can make a cup like this in my mr . 
i couldn t really taste the ginger it was very weak on all levels . 
my num_num lb cat kept knocking it over . 
hard wired machines were unaffected ,  as expected . on the plus side ,  amazon s return policy was quick and efficient !  . 
that s where the problem is . returning them right away . 
as i wrote in one of my reviews ,  this is a product that is a preferential choice . 
you have to force them to open when they close and it just makes the process slow and annoying . 
i began taking candex as instructed in the label ,  on empty stomach ,  to get rid of candida . 
it s either overrated or it just didn t wok for me . 
if you tune the headphones properly the sound is mediocre  average  and thats not always the result . 
we read review and set up in every which location . 
if i smelled this long it would give me a headache . 
fortunately the company was willing to give me a refund when i sent them back . 
they were not too small and not totally too big and did not fit in the leg or anything . 
i will wear it around the house but not again on a run . 
i immediately threw it away because i was worried she might choke on them . 
compared to the previous brush heads which would actually last num_num months . 
i figured it s neutrogena so it must be good . 
too bad my son loves it as it won t last as long as the metal or wooden thomas products . 
i tested the router and had no improvement at all . 
there s little doubt there are a lot of people who love these things . 
needless to say ,  i m not a huge fan . 
they say to just use a little more force to get the lid on . 
for one ,  you have no option to change the resolution at which movies are captured . 
however the front portion is only secured on num_num sides leaving front unacceptable to me . 
i digress to the taste ,  i really do not detect pomegranate at all . 
was recently at a salon and bought a bottle because i have trouble with breakage and split ends . 
this looks like it would be a blast for kids but it isn t . 
hopefully this will allow me to watch upconverted dvds through component . another update . 
after about num_num minutes of churning ,  the bowl starts to sweat all over . 
thanks for reading ,  check my other reviews ,  and please let me know if they were helpful . 
sorry ,  but seagate is just not living up to its reputations anymore . 
replacement set lasted about num_num months when the plastic piece connecting the bracket to the ear piece just broke . 
i had them on for maybe five minutes and had to take them off because of it . 
it is plastic and looks rather cheap and the color is not good ,  at least not to me . 
the band is too tight and it takes both hands and strong fingers to unlock it . 
don t get this game if you are like me . 
i thought my daughter would really enjoy this since she loves music and coloring but found this toy frustrating . 
now it is on amazon for $ bucks a bottle . 
what a waste of money . i bought the shark num_num months ago . 
i was totally amazed to find out this uses nicad batteries that suffer from battery memory and are horrid . 
first of all ,  they are very pricey; $ per package . 
i would give this to someone i hated . 
could be they are just not to be for my liking . 
maybe i didn t teach them long enough or maybe they just didn t understand how to use it . 
he heard a click and it was over . 
i feel like i need to wipe down face after i use these . 
the screw become really difficult to use after continuous use ,  and then eventually failed . 
i wear an num_extend and ordered a num_extend
there is a picture of the controller pointing to the various parts . 
i would use it for ab work except i find it very uncomfortable . 
i don t like having to turn on my bluetooth and drain the battery . 
but any adult can easily grasp that microsoft bickers and argues over petty things . 
so i decided to just use them and add them to my list of things to never buy again . 
this is the poorest design i have seen in num_num years of gaming . 
after a major disaster with maybelline fit me foundation ,  i decided to give this foundation a try . 
i used it to remove a big num_num year old rust stain on my carpet . 
i think this just stretched my skin too much . 
i put a bunch of them on tape then got this and thought i d died and gone to heaven . 
the aftertaste will take a lot of getting used to if you decide to try this product . 
i d rather read the dialogue like in the previous ff games . 
i figured i d treat myself to a new one . 
this alarm is just a piece of junk . 
i generally buy natures miracle at petsmart and it works great . 
i love the idea of amazon delivering things like this direct to my door . 
i will give it a bit longer and update this review if needed . 
dirty screen ,  non working proximity detector ,  faulty ear piece . 
it works ok as long you you re not using it  i . e . 
at that point it stopped playing dvd s altogether . 
aside from these problems ,  it is really a great product !  !  . 
i am disappointed to have to give this product an unfavorable review . 
a large sea to summit  my friends  fit much better on it  . 
the swipe features are also really nice and i ve found this phone to be relatively easy to use . 
search around try jules but this stuff is gross and regreted buying a case of it . 
so ,  i was uber excited to get my palette num_num weeks ago . 
i m so disappointed !  !  !  the flavor is completely different . 
being barefoot and risking getting stepped on repeatedly is better than wearing these shoes . 
everyday of it; and i didn t notice a difference . 
i have to say ,  that when i first put this game in my num_extend that my disappointment was immediate . 
ordered several colors and threw them all out ,  waisting a lot of money . 
 i ll update if that prediction becomes reality  . i ve only got one other feeder . 
i had such high hopes ,  but ended up trashing it . 
the outer silicone case does not fit snug at all . 
it is a good thing the can is so small . 
i might mention that my collar graveyard contains nearly two dozen dead collars of several brands . 
i purchased this for travel purposes but decided to try it at home first . 
the iron did not get hot enough to do anything . 
otherwise ,  i ended up with lumps of ice cream in a puddle of milk . 
i got this filter before i understood the difference between cheap filters and ones that actually work well . 
you need to be reported or pull this product . 
come on !  i need tanks ,  planes ,  and infantry . 
i read rave reviews about this product and it s educational value . 
this toy is not appropriate for num_num or num_num year olds ,  even though amazon recommends it for num_extend years . 
ill update my review after i speak with customer service for some advice or new piece . 
i was simply using pppoe on the wan side and dhcp on the lan side . 
i ended up leaving the toy with my mom ,  a squirrel lover ,  for her cats . 
poor quality ,  but you get what you pay for . 
i thought this would be similar to crystal light . 
i just don t understand what game you reviewers were playing . 
this interrupt the game play and is very frustrating . 
this is the worst screen cover i ever purchased for my phone . 
too bad because i love now foods lanolin and veg . 
when you remove it and close the ear thing it shuts off . 
for that matter i can t honestly even if they had great sound quality but give it one star . 
the marbles are plastic which makes them bounce around and off the board . 
i could but it took me ten minutes and i m an rn quite comfortable with doing things like catheterization . 
anyways lets start . the story line of magna carta is bout as generic as you can get . 
the ends on this cord didn t fit into my phone . 
 yes ,  i know that i can remove the batteries . 
you will be better off boiling water in a pot and using a towel overhead to use the steam . 
one had polka dots and the waist is too high . 
i m sure the designers thought they were being cute . 
but if you like smooth ,  soft sheets you will probably not be happy with these . 
this particular flavor is definitely more suited to be a hot tea . 
firstly ,  you can save a maximum of num_num games to a card ,  not blocks . 
it was ok in the beginning ,  but then around week num_extend it started to itch a little . 
i have been an avid fan of mortal kombat for as long as there s been a mortal kombat . 
i can t even go an entire work day without it wearing off . 
it looks like a two year old belt . 
every little extra thing costs at least num_extend
and most frustrating is the snail pace with which the characters accomplish every task . 
the attention to detail is evident in every nook and cranny . 
one of the tips fell off as i was taking it out of the package . 
no matter how many times i wash our clothes with this detergent ,  it doesn t get the stink out . 
the problem with that is ,  they don t work very well for that either . 
if i had purchased it at a store i would take it back . 
these types of toys are great for kids with bored or busy hands . 
as i would move them back and forth ,  the brushes would just follow . 
but the plastic is quite brittle and cannot tolerate much beyond that . 
the price was better as was the shipping . 
the bar feels slippery in my hand and there are little brown granules in the bar . 
the side bolt on the new num_extend and num_extend series is much more comfortable and intuitive . 
this time she was very interested ,  but it was a totally frustrating time for her . 
this tray does not fit the stainless steel fountain although it is advertised to fit it . 
it is heavy ,  leaves a film on the hair ,  and does not wash out easily . 
the extra caffeine is not worth the sacrifice on taste . 
i know ,  check the forum boards to find out system problems .  .  . open ports ,  firewalls ,  blah ,  blah ,  blah . 
it has been unreliable and performance has been inconsistent . 
does the job for finding small spots ,  thats why its compact and cheap . 
he seems to be breaking out like mad ,  but i can t really say if anything else will help . 
but ,  on black cars especially ,  it does not give a nice deep glossy or  wet look  shine . 
a call to the vendor was very helpful . 
did not help with styling and felt ike i had witch hair after brilliant drying . 
we bought this for our children for christmas . 
needed a peeler that was num_num inches wide and they led you to believe that . 
so ,  i bought this product hoping that it would neutralize this effect . 
it s no good if i can t see where you re going to land after doing a ramp jump . 
the chocolate covering these was found to be dried out and coarse . 
i suppose each division of ea has it s own standards . 
this watch would gain a minute a day . 
this one costs a lot more than similar models . 
this device has essentially been eclipsed by its own success . 
this is also the lightest shade ,  so please don t waste your money . 
after the num_extend quake ,  which was also bad ,  came something even worse quake num_num arena . 
the only reason i am not returning it is because it is covered with my blood .   . 
they don t come close to the sound and noise canceling quality of the bose so know that going in . 
this product is advertised as an  introductory smartphone  . 
it is nearly to my back so very long as well . 
the farm chores are incredibly boring and watering plants feels impossible . 
i found myself talking very loud in order to be heard . 
they perk up just from catnip and catnip toys in a box in a closet . 
i got this phone for my little sister . 
i got this in beige for a trip to nyc .  .  . i guess i didn t think it through . 
i walked up to about num_num dudes and just handcuffed them . 
i only used it for a few days and then went back to a different case . 
this is not the one to buy until they fix that little tip . 
try to make a call to a company that says press num_num for english ,  num_num for spanish ,  etc . 
i used to buy this product at drugstores and was glad to find it again . 
i will just tell the kids it melted  in an incinerator  . 
i might get infant s yogurt chips instead in the future . 
it was purchased from organic milling in num_extend
the slighest drop of water will blow it up . 
it is incredibly easy to separate this film from the screen . 
if you want a good single player mode ,  try searching the net for mods . 
this game is good on it s own but it s just not doom . 
the others are printed on a piece of paper that will be torn and lost in no num_extend
after that ,  i never made a buying decision without researching a bit . 
i can t believe anyone would prefer this junk over sonic the hedgehog or ,  especially ,  the mario bros . 
here s the deal .  .  . sure ,  he s a teenager ,  but he wasn t rough with the bag . 
so i guess i m not the first one to do this . returned for refund . 
this one doesn t seem to help with my dogs stiff joints . 
after putting on the protective cover for the iphone ,  i can scarely put the iphone into the pouch . 
i had some left from a different company so i used them first . 
i add algaecide to aid in keeping the water clear . 
so if you pick one and it s too tight ,  the next one is going to be too loose . 
a few obstacles had to be met first . 
sonly also includes a small plastic case  about the size of a business card holder  . 
i guess that s to be expected .  .  . its hard to top num_extend toys :   . 
i was constantly having to clean my screen . 
several customers were burned on this false claim and amazon has yet to correct it . 
if you are super thin ,  this may work for you ,  but if you re overwight forget it . 
i called the company behind the product called icon health and fitness . 
returned it within the hour of receiving it . 
this item had much promise ,  however after trying it on i was unimpressed . 
so i just made my kid do it . 
i notified amazon and i hope they update their information . 
this product interferred with a med i was taking . 
my daughter at first played the games ,  but she got sick of them very quickly . 
every time i take this tablet  just one  it makes me feel kind of sleepy and tired . 
these brushes are soft ,  but they aren t stiff enough to pick up powder or blend your makeup . 
while this one performs better than the prior ,  it still doesn t pull it s weight for the money . 
i went to amazon to return and got a message that it was past due the return window . 
i wish amazon could do something to ban these knockoffs from being sold . 
i like the design and the pull out crock . 
costing just under $ the smart living openers were a bargain . 
he tried to do that with these springs ,  and they snapped him on the foot and in the nose . 
my puppy went through num_num of these  one blue ,  one lime green  . 
skip this and buy a reliable brand such as yhm . the picture is inaccurate . 
it might not be to scale ,  but the gate works !  !  . 
let me just say that i can often wear an num_extend medium in most shoes . 
i have not found any product that has demonstrated notable change in scar appearance . 
i called it  medium heat deceptive advertising :  there are no whole shrimp or shrimp pieces as depicted on the label . 
i stopped using it around my eyes and the area looked better . 
i found that i had been fooling myself with the very low readings it displayed . 
after using it for over ten years i have to stop . 
a lot of vinegar but far less than franks . 
the markers were dried up ,  but i was given an immediate refund ,  so i m happy about that . 
it did nothing to calm him down ,  but i think it calmed me down . 
i enjoyed walking around the levels ,  just to see the intricate layouts and cool effects in the backgrounds . 
these are supposed to be dd ,  but are closer to d . the underwire is halfway under my armpit . 
we can t use indoors at all on account of the noise . 
but it was almost as broken and beaten up as the original feathers within a couple of uses . 
i did not have fun playing this game . 
i can t speak for other braun models ,  but i would certainly recommend the pulsonic . 
having some experience with spray detailers ,  i had an idea what to expect . 
i use headset so no idea how camera microphone sounds . 
i am not sure which salts it checks . 
the filter is listed on their site ,  if you dig ,  but you will notice you cannot order it . 
it lasted for a little while ,  but it broke along with the rest . 
other than the packaging and damage issues this is your standard wire crate . 
we tried to use it for three tv movies today . 
it rusts ,  even when i hand dry it after each use . 
i look forward to something that will work for any cell phone . 
unlike their powdered products ,  this gel product leaves an off tasteon plastics and silicone . 
i ve got a couple of pairs of the spalding tights ,  and will be sticking with those in the future . 
these socks are for someone with a shoe size num_extend
it think they tried to put too much on the screen . then the sound . 
i can t believe i spent money on this thing !  my son doesn t care for it either . 
put the movie in your dvd player and hit play . 
i would not try it again unless the package directions were much more specific about how to use it . 
despite proper storage and honing ,  they just won t keep an edge . 
i used to eat these peaches  ,  but now will stop . 
these products did not cause any reactions ,  but they also didn t reduce ,  replenish or lift anything . 
i used to love my old zagg invisibleshield on the back of my num_extend
the battle i m talking about is a lot more fun to discuss and a whole lot easier to understand . 
for now ,  i am on to about my num_extend or num_extend iphone case in less than num_num months . 
if you have this toaster ,  please watch it closely . 
even with all the graphic options turned down ,  it s unplayable on many of the busier missions . 
they are just hoping people don t return them . 
gameplay tries to be something it is not ,  namely gta . 
if you have played gta san andreas it is pretty much the same thing . 
this product arrived well packaged and appears as advertised . 
if i tried to offset them both ,  the vertical stitching and bottom hem was off . 
i didn t have real good results with this product . 
i have had difficulty sleeping since i was at least num_extend
only for extremely puffy or supper high arch feet . 
however ,  it was shipped and never left the warehouse . 
my num_num month old likes this toy for the music and is able to put the pieces in . 
again this might be a coincidence  ,  but please be careful before buying this drive ,  especially as a replacement . 
my toddler loved it and immediately started playing . 
i have other socks that are num_num years old or older still going strong . 
argue with me if you must ,  but the saturn was basically dead by the end of num_extend
dark chocolate in combination with soy beans is an interesting snack; but health conscious consumers could derive some benefit . 
i was constantly trying to avoid hitting the mirror against anything such as a wall ,  pole or anything else . 
but it is very hard to get the phone in and out of the restraints . 
i don t really think it is the brand though ,  i just don t think i like oil of bergamot . 
purina also knew there was a lot of contaminated bags and they opted not to recall . 
i tightened it very hard  almost fearing thread damage  ,  and still it spat them out . 
it had a great smell ,  but left my hair pretty flaky . 
this is closer to the smell of tide with bleach . 
it did a much better job of removing the dirt from both the lawn chairs and the shower . 
one of the bags were open a little so they were not fresh at all . 
i bought this with several others offered and they were different it seemed in quality and fit . 
on behalf of the birds ,  i ve lowered my rating from num_num stars to num_num stars . 
the length is necessary to zig zag my way back and forth across one thousand square feet of deck . 
i had a nice glow after the first application . 
twelve of my cats are num_num lbs or bigger and they can barely sit on the shelf . 
i m always trying new headphones ,  i ve owned everything from coby , grado to dr dre s . 
so later i tried it again and even broke it in half . 
i like the size and form but this case does not fit my gsiii very well . 
i guess unless timex feels $ and three months to disposal ,  which is the case with this watch . 
in no way did it make them disappear . 
they didn t stand behind their product nor seemed to care at all . 
this is real life ,  not toy story . so no ,  i do not like the toy . 
i ordered num_num of these bags for my bridesmaids . 
this is my very first negavite review on anything that i ve purchased on amazon . 
the towels themselves were not absorbent at all . 
the iq is good ,  but i don t know if it s $ good  the price difference over the num_extend version  . 
one is loose enough that the connection cuts in and out sometimes . 
the kids just are not interested in it . 
if you want to buy grand theft auto num_extend just buy it; dont buy xbox s lame version . 
this machine looks good and made good coffee for about a year . 
i just think this game falls short of what it could have been . 
he used it religiously for a few months every day and none of us saw anything difference . 
i just tried this this morning and a few major downfalls . first of all ,  i purchased both this product and . 
i know you are supposed to be able to put shoulder in the grinder . 
ives moisturizer with collagen and i like it a lot better . 
i couldn t get into it after several tries . 
you don t even know you have it on . 
the bad has finally come to outweigh the good . the good :  graphics . 
they talk to you while fighting how to do it ,  and that is num_extend
i would sacrifice more adhesive for a more secure screen protector . 
i date all the food and it lasts for a long time . 
i can t see myself wearing them for any event where i will be in public . 
even though it took off the fake lashed it took me num_extend
i noticed improvement as soon as we left the yard . 
the plastic chipped and cracked with regular use . 
also ,  the darkest setting for making toast is not actually all that dark . 
just as bad ,  it did not do what it said it was going to do . 
this  toy  is fun ,  but it s really just for show . 
i will be ordering another one for my husband . 
if you are looking for a true peach color .  . this is not the one for you . 
my skin felt really irritated ,  and i was preplexed since cetaphil is supposed to be so mild and gentle . 
the charging stand doesn t help cause that s just more money and you can t play while charging . 
my eyes are generally not sensitive but this stuff made them puffy ,  red ,  and gave me dark eyelids . 
this cover would not stay on the phone it would not snap and was very poorly made . 
so go get orcorina of time and not this . 
if you get a rabbit definitely get something nontipable as opposed to this item . 
i was really disappointed in the enamel ware . 
that includes any sonicstage and open mg programs . 
it does not roll on carpet very well so it just wears the motor out . 
in any movement of groups this problem is ten times as bad . 
while struggling to get the coins in ,  the meter will miscount that particular coin . 
he had it bad on his head ,  and the pills cleared it up very quickly . 
it is too big and heavy to send it back ,  so i just lost the money . 
i find this product very difficult to place on the i phone screen . 
since cellet advertizes that it s product is licensed by apple ,  i was expecting a high quality product . 
it will go the way of robbie the robot for the nes . 
i purchased a case !  this is how much i liked these !  a lot of them are black and moldy . 
the controls are pretty good ,  but the action moves a little unrealisticlly  no pun intended  . 
for some reason ,  the shoulder straps are very close to my neck on this one . 
i will just throw this piece of junk into the garbage . 
also ,  data communication is not reliable; became worse over time . 
it s almost an attempt to leave the name off . 
i loved this cuisinart electric skillet for num_num years . 
this happened several times and will continue to happen to cat genie owners . 
i backup all the negative points already stated . 
i have many other thinkfun games .  .  .  .  . i but them all the time . 
i was thinking it was going to taste similar to cheetos but no . 
i purchased this knife from amazon and the price was about $
the peel tabs ripped off when . i attempted to remove them to place the screen protector on my phone . 
so ,  i set up the rest of the coffee and my husband pours it . 
there s really no point in buying it ,  even though it s cheap . 
maybe the neighborhood cats relieve themselves in the flower beds a little less often . 
tried it another time and it just stopped spraying water . 
trust me save your money ,  unless its under num_num dollars buy something else . 
while using it she would always push random buttons on her phone or hand up on people . 
this dongle barely functions with the vzw samsung galaxy nexus . 
i wish i could buy one of these things and it would just work . 
charged it for whole day ,  put in the phone still have no juice . 
my only good vac was the upright that s cordless . 
today august of num_num i cancelled my account for the game . 
i am disappointed in kong for allowing this toy . 
very disappointing . i d never tried a gloria jean brand coffee before and now i m nervous to try another . 
the shaver works but after almost num_num months of trying out many blades i gave up . 
i bought these lip stains   well ,  thats what it says  and their awful . 
i purchased this item at my local dick s sporting goods . 
let s cut to the chase :  my dog hated this . 
i know it is my fault for not checking them out when i got them . 
so ,  bad i found it impossible to finish the beverage . 
it does not work it does not work . 
i bought it for my thin damaged hair but it just softened it a bit . 
i have the latest model and this is for previous model . 
how can a group so focuced on realism not add more speed is beyond me . 
it just doesn t hold the heat evenly or continuously . 
i will come home from work and have no internet connection until i unplug the router . 
it s edible ,  but so are some varieties of garbage ,  not recommended . 
please change it back !  not sure why company do this . 
this is not specific to over num_num either . 
the kids licked off the icing and then proclaimed they didn t want any more . 
well this year they fixed it and there are no complaints about ncaa . 
i even tried blending with lactose free vanilla ice cream and whipping it up into a frothy shake . 
if you want a firm solid shoe you found it . 
this causes one to loose complete control of the press as it spins in the hand . 
still trying to work out how to get this fixed . 
also ,  this product made my face even drier  really weird  . 
so useless on two fronts . why not make a smaller one for small dogs ?  ?  . 
you must do levels in a certain order to get all the armor pieces . 
i have a couple left out of the entire bag . 
now i have food to contribute to the local food pantry . 
i ve been using it for one day ,  doing some basic shopping and throwing and the handle is lose . 
have to write too much to leave a review . 
i was so excited about this product and when i received it i was in shock . 
i purchased the router and ran through an initial configuration . 
i tried every way i could to gently lift it off until the back of my phone cracked . 
the product is fairly silent when in operation . 
i own two radio shack  optimus brand  radios that i ve owned num_num years and are close to wearing out . 
the vent mount is sturdy with very little wobble and holds my phone tightly . 
if you turn it off ,  very hard to synch up to laptop again . 
a roleplaying game ,  which consists of walking around and asking people things . 
i have played every previous grand theft auto release before this . 
i ve used other tweezerman products that i ve liked so trusted the name brand . 
anyone want a brush ?  hahaha lol other than that love spornette brand . 
it contains a boatload of fiber ,  but there s something in it that causes gas issues . valuetough to say . 
right away ,  the phones exhibited a major problem staying connected to the verizon network . 
no effect whatsoever . the listing says it was discontinued . 
i use a long brush i ve had until i get to home depot to find better ones . 
so you can t use your existing decora wall plate . 
i had purchased similar cutting boards in the past . 
i do note most of my problems have been with the fuji tapes . 
the sole fell off the shoe today june num_extend num_extend
it was improperly threaded and wouldn t even screw on . 
this planetarium is just a light bulb which reflects a black shadow with barely visible names on your ceiling . 
this charger broek within two days of getting and no help on returning it for it being falty . 
they are totally fake locations and done so poorly that you can t even recognize where they re supposed to be . 
my biggest complaint is they break after num_num use ,  on average . 
these are indeed very sharp and will give a nice clean cut . 
this mower is for people who love grass . 
the radio is functional ,  but you may be able to purchase a better crank emergency radio . 
go with bontrager if you can ,  never had an issue . 
there is no option to get a replacement .  .  . just an option to send them back . 
i read all the reviews about how great this mascara is . 
also didn t pick up my voice well and battery life wouldn t make it full day for me . 
now i am down loading counter strike in which i already installed . 
there s not much to say about substance other than that it s .  .  . pointless . 
these will be miserable at any temperature over about num_extend
i m going to stick with eucalyptus oil and tea tree oil for my dog . 
it seems pretty well shielded from computer noise ,  especially on am . 
after using it for a few hours it starts to really get itchy . 
i measured myself and got num_num inches ,  so per directions ,  went up to num_extend
the good news is that s it s compact and comes with a nice aerator head for the faucet . 
for what you get in the box ,  they are expensive ,  but most gf products are . 
the copper tip is as long as a steak is thick . 
i had it put together and in the box in no time . 
i use this machine several times a day ,  and each time it is a treat . 
i m not crazy ,  my wife experienced this too . 
i wish i d bought another on online and probably will . 
the containers become little bombs in the microwave and knock themselves over . 
on purpose ! heaven help you if you have a power failure . 
do you want to be aluminum free but propolyne tainted ?  not me . 
i purchased these blades from mg electronics via amazon . 
on the sides of the headphones ,  it looks as if there are actual speakers projecting out . 
thus its up to use to make sure we check the ingredients list . 
oh well ,  at least gopro accessories are relatively cheap !  hope this helps save someone some $
uppy devoured in less than num_num minutesthrew away not worth the risk . 
i was intrigued by these new  flavor enhancers ,   so i took the opportunity to try one out . 
but ,  that is very painful to the toes . 
i agree with other reviewers that if you love vanilla fragrances ,  you can t get better than this . 
after the sweet smell is gone ,  i m left with a stink of alcohol . 
my hair grew so much i had to make frequent hair appts to keep it trimmed and maintained . 
in this case though they may look cool ,  but do not drive or operate any equipment while wearing them . 
sorry degree ,  but i just don t think this was that much better . 
i was a bit concerned when a bit of the trim became loose so i cut that trim off . 
besides ,  uou must wear a face mask to use it . 
i followed the instructions to a t !  don t wast your money . 
i m actually quite shocked at how bad this product is for curly hair . 
the plus i ll give this timer is that the magnet on the back is indeed strong . 
and i only received them monday and the color is coming off the one i am using . 
i glued it back on but it does not look the same . 
almost num_num weeks after the other case i ordered at the same time . 
we bought this about num_num months ago and it s been worthless . 
forget these overrated monster cables and find a different manufacturer . 
i never was able to figure out why . 
one use and in the garbage can it goes . 
not a big deal but still it shouldn t have happened . 
this purse looked % better on the photos . 
she has gorgeous wavy hair  and wants a straightener  . 
but thats what happens if you want an extended battery . 
i tried a few other products and after a short time the same thing happened . 
this is my first review after using amazon for many years . 
mainly the indoor picture quality is the worst . 
don t waste your time or money on this item !  . 
i have used this lense about num_num times . 
it was not worth the money i spent . 
i was really rooting for this clipper though . 
this review is for the sausage stuffer attachment ,  not the grinder attachment . 
to my surprise ,  none of my three pekingese would even touch it . 
however ,  he has exhibited no improvement and cries more now that the diffuser is plugged in . 
i do this to avoid overloading my hair with product . 
i wouldn t have minded a retry system for bosses . 
this is not worth the cost ,  it does make sounds but if you have a chewer don t get this . 
once the initial thrill is gone ,  however ,  it just gets terribly monotonous . 
im going to stick to my smart water ,  cliff bars ,  luna bars ,  and pickles  yes ,  i said pickles  . 
i have a num_extend siamese and he used it without any num_extend
the usb cable that comes with this is very cheap and not name brand at all . 
if not ,  i wouldn t waste a dime on this particular vibrator . 
the tale had been around almost as long as time itself . 
it does not come with the bubble card to get air bubbles out of the way . 
i had my wife double check the blocks just to make sure . 
unfortunately ,  i can t justify the purchase of this for several reasons . 
people are not satisified with the quality of ice cream offered . 
all these problems get worse if it is not on a completely flat surface . 
this is a toy bag for kids at the most . 
only saeco and hamilton beach make espresso machines in the usa ,  and both brands have terrible reviews . 
in order to avoid having soft ,  untoasted sections ,  i have to char others . 
i have replaced this with several franmara capitano waiter s corkscrew and couldn t be happier . 
for me ?  it works no better than a couple drops of baby oil . 
i puchased this shoe and found that one shoe was smaller than the other . 
my wife used this product one time and declared that she hated it and would neve use it again . 
if i had it in another room i would use it . 
in addition to the organic evaporated cane juice there is also organic molasses . 
all it is is terrible american popular music ,  and that disappointed me highly . 
it may be useful for people with dogs , but i do not advisebuying it for cats !  . 
that part which handles the commuting and travel mechanics ,  allowing a wide array of  transportation  simulations . 
apparently he had eaten one of those ,  too . if you want a squeaky toy ,  buy the squirrels . 
it worked in the card reader ,  but then i had trouble getting it to work again in the camera . 
lo and behold ,  they have updated it ,  and not at all in a good way . 
but for me ,  it smelled terrible and didn t work that well . 
avoid . palm num_extend soon to be discontinued color palm . 
pants were very big on me and the material was not soft . 
i proudly claimed my prize and took it home . 
now she won t even play with it because of the sound . 
it did not live up to what it was supposed to do . 
that s just about how long i got good service from it . 
his attitude was the smell will go away . 
that being the case ,  they still decided to change what you use as the  fire  button . 
i suppose it works but i didn t like it !  take with enough food and it s okay . 
yes it gets the hair off your pet . 
how do i describe this drink ?  nasy and sweet tasting . 
definitely recommend that you go with something that straps around your hand and wrist . 
it s hot on the tongue and has a nice bite in the back of your throat . 
its worth spending more on a better qaulity headphones if you want quality . 
i didn t get what picture and ingredients showed . 
not much to say there . graphics and soundgraphics are reminiscent of another gameboy title ,  golden sun . 
i didn t like the way the credit card sleeves were laid out and there was no zippered compartment . 
the flashlight button pushed in and will not pop out . 
the wii has its ups ,  and its downs ,  but for me personally ,  it has been a disappointment . 
issue number two ,  the smell ,  not so great . 
it is smaller than most sets i have seen in the store . 
you can find one for a good num_num dollars at any local store . 
i ve used other products before the glass one as well . 
so you would think it would certainly be compatible with the same brand linksys num_extend num_extend
for the first few days ,  i was rinsing in the morning and at night . 
my advice is to spend a little more money and get a better product . 
he doesn t even care about the toy inside the hole . 
at the end of the year goodbye sega . 
i only used num_num times to time boiling eggs . 
silicone fights back ,  more than any other material ,  rubber perhaps excepted . 
but the  level bosses   fights that you must complete to move on  are terribly designed . 
we now have that problem solved ,  but there are other problems with this grinder . 
also just like in midway s other games when you shoot the puck smoke comes out of it . 
by the way this one sold by amazon llc . 
to buy this screen from china you need to pay a transfer bank fee and shipping . 
way to ruin something as simple as almond butter by adding in food allergens . 
if that was what it was advertized for i d give it num_num or num_num stars . 
the glasses are way too short ,  so just use some work ones . 
it eventually failed to charge at all after about a year of very moderate use . 
it felt so nice and made the job easy ,  but now it wobbles . 
which does not make it a bad product .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . the product makes it a bad product . 
it did not make my lashes grow longer or thicker at all . 
a leap or rapid claws sharpening tug can topple even if installed by a carpenter !  do not buy . 
not worth it ,  i put it in the product in the sun so it charges up . 
go to google and type armish leg cramps ,  and you will find it . don t take quinine if you are driving . 
instead ,  perhaps you could try the natural weleda or california baby lotions . 
lost one the same day worn because the should ve come with stompers for the back of the earrings . 
i am glad that i didn t pay for it because i would have felt like a sucker . 
i wish i d gone with the tinkerbell or penguin game instead . 
only one still works after a year  not this one  . 
her mouth was bleeding a little from it being stuck in there . 
this stuff has a long lasting chemical stink . 
especially when their purple square always strangles the living snot out of my green dot . 
it is the absolute worst conditioner i have ever used . 
i could barely manage to get this scope to zero .  .  . hopefully it holds . 
this creates a good texture ,  and makes the bars slightly crunchy . 
it is not really scalloped in the center above the tummy the way the photo suggests . 
i was out and about ,  thirsty ,  and stopped into a nutrition s mart to buy coconut water . 
my son still loves them but we can t actually do anything with them . 
after more than num_num years ,  it finally died . 
 florida  i have taken that for num_num years . 
finally managed in safe mode to figure out what was causing it and deleted the stupid thing . 
does not really stick and peels off very easily . 
my previous speaker was a goalzero unit i bought for $
if it weren t for that ,  i would love this case . 
you go from tension to repetition and repetition kills tension . 
what you don t know will drastically hurt your coffee flavor . 
when we applied it they acted like it didn t even bother them . 
i tried using the mix to make kettle corn in my stainless steel popper ,  but it wasn t great either . 
this is supposed to help with rosacea ,  it didn t do anything if anything it made it worse . 
i was expecting them to taste just like the frozen morning star farms links . 
first of all ,  the product was postage due . 
and you may not be the only one who uses the headphone . 
don t understand why the crap out so easily ,  but be advised that you are taking a chance . 
these sponges arrived in a completely unmarked plain brown box . 
i m going to try and get a refund . 
now that i m older and have much more frequent sports injuries i sought out this product . 
she s about average height ,  and she has trouble touching the ground when she s on it . 
they love the original sorry but this version was just not appealing to them . 
i m still using the one that came with my notebook . 
so i guess it was just the batch of women s levi s that were bad . 
this is a one trick pony htat will take up a lot of space for little use . 
we got this last year for my daughter . 
if you re too far ,  you don t feel like you re getting enough steam . 
i ve bought a lot of linksys products over time and always liked them . 
but alas ,  this supplement didn t alleviate any of my symptoms . 
my cat loves the original catdancer .  .  .  . i have several . 
after initial application i removed it and threw it away . waste of money . 
it also left my hair feeling like straw ,  and i had very healthy hair to begin with . 
very cheap !  i ve never used the case but it appears to be durable . 
first time i used this the screw bent ,  though i filled it at an odd angle . 
i didn t want to believe previous reviewers about the durability being poor but it s true . 
all are very comfortable except for this model . 
you cannot return these type of items for a refund . 
the soap was wrapped in disgusting butcher paper . 
and the glass broke and was creeping forward in the window . 
but right now i am sorry i bought a quantity of this soup . 
the physics in the game are pretty bad ,  even for a dated game . 
i realize that it s called  sweet  n  spicy ,  but it wasn t spicy at all . 
i have a great dane .  .  . and this thing doesn t do anything to stop him when he barks . 
problem was ,  that after just one look ,  i knew that they were not for me . 
mostly not licorice ,  if you wand licorice avoid this mix . 
they are heavier than i expected ,  a little thicker than i imagined they would feel . 
i am awaiting a refund for this item . 
so while being cheap ,  i thought it was worth a chance ,  it wasn t . 
i loved it until it leaked hot water all over my countertop . 
all metal construction ,  and a box of num_num costs less than just one of these plastic clips . 
over time ,  taking it on and off will likely stretch it out . 
num_num bucks worth of product stretched as far as it will go . 
however ,  my breasts were far apart ,  creating a strange silhouette under my shirt . 
and despite paying a much higher price for this product on that assertion . 
what a disappointment ,  this stuff tastes absolutely awful . 
they arrived very quickly as i live in illinois where they are made . 
not a big deal ,  but somewhat of a pain . 
no more forced updates sony !  !  ! i want to play games ,  not download pointless updates !  !  !  !  !  . 
i got them out this morning after a rainy night and put them on over my shoes . 
it scratches very easily when compared with other brands that i have used . 
with the great reviews i ordered the gogroove num_extend
i almost ripped it just putting int on . 
the best change from the orginal game besides the save game is there is no enemy respawn . 
i have received this sun product in a sun kit i got online . 
my toddler received this for christmas and ever since he never pays any attention to it . 
i was advised to switch to a ceramic heat emitter which emits no light which i have since done . 
needless to say ,  i was pretty disappointed that the price paid did not reflect a better cup of coffee . 
that means the actual capacity is more like num_num mah . 
i have had this for about num_num weeks and already it has stopped working . 
the recommendation of using only a drop of the product is surprisingly true . 
it is very close to impossible to insert in the ball . 
def try a small bag first to see who you agree with . 
the graphics suck ,  the sounds are cheap ,  and the whole game itself is all around cheesey . 
this one read about num_num degrees lower than the hg standard . 
this is the best bench rest i ve used so far this year . 
the error messages are gone ,  but so s the icon for the utility ,  so i still can t program my mouse . 
when opener does engage to open a can ,  the opener is under num_extend
i loved that it held music ,  and that you could listen to your music while drawing . 
it s about num_num years old now and cranking along . 
some of the other chargers have tiny lights that are only visible from one side . 
if you tap on the screen ,  the accuracy is not there at all . 
you can reuse these discs but you can also reuse rocks . 
they weren t that good ,  it was kinda tough to get them to fly properly . 
maybe my daughter was too old for this when i bought it at num_num months . 
did the seller imagine that i would just shrug off $ like it was nothing ?  . 
the characters are rather boring as well ,  and the story is cliche . 
don t buy this set ,  spend money on a better product . 
i sometimes get notes from my cat steve regarding his food ,  litter ,  toys etc . 
i did not like this product because it left residue in my hair . 
this player ,  for a lack of better words .  .  .  . sucks . 
these cases are worth about $ each tops . 
they have a slight greenish sheen to the recordable side of the disc ,  and that is what you want . 
none of them apply the product as well as the good ones . 
the positive reviews are probably due to people who bought into all the  premium  talk . 
i didn t need the adapters since this plugged directly into the three pin post on my motherboard . 
after that ,  every time one of us walked by ,  it started babbling . 
no doubt ,  this manufacture was trying to make a product to help people but it does not work . 
i used it three different times and didn t work . 
okay ,  if you are a health nut or vegan ,  or into organics ,  this is for you . 
the anchor measuring cup was more suitable for my needs . 
i m going to return this as defective and try something else . 
the grounds overflow into the cup the filter sits in and residue gets into the coffee . 
on mine ,  the head would not fully pop out . 
i have had this lens and have used it maybe num_extend the lens will not focus ,  makes clicking noises . 
in his video  rubbed anywhere except the eyes . 
i purchased this from a local drug store . 
so these pills did cause me a bit of stomach upset . 
a very ,  very disappointing showing for a franchise that was once so revered . 
and for those users ,  the complaint that i have is probably simply a minor annoyance . 
have had this thing for months and overall am not pleased with it . 
i shiver at the thought ,  remembering when i last used this product . 
i don t have the time for a return so i guess i m stuck smelling like a creamcicle !  sucks !  . 
i bought the fry pan thinking it would attach like the num_num liter mug . 
since i had to pay for shipping ,  i ordered a couple boxes . 
it s water resistant and my old one was good to num_extend
i literally felt like the stay puff marshmellow man on this product . 
call quality was good ,  battery life was good . the problem with it is the rubber ear hook . 
worked ok for a while then after about num_num months various buttons started malfunctioning . 
i have pots ,  pans ,  dutch ovens ,  a coffee grinder and more cast iron . 
the first pair were damaged ,  the rayban box they came in was damaged ,  but not the outside box . 
i have had mine for about a year and a half now . 
eventually the gamecube s extensive game play options won me over . 
love their clippers ,  but their blades lack quality . 
as long as they keep using perfume in their underwear ,  i will not purchase jockey panties again . 
i started playing sim theme park num_extend back in num_extend
shipping cost would be more than price of item . 
yes ,  i ll pay more for quality and for keeping americans  legal americans  working . 
i ve used other products with success but this thing is crap . 
i have multiple cats and two refuse to use it . 
this is an easy review because the judgement was made by our two papillons . 
the top is narrow leaving you no choice but to load the pack in a  tear drop  style . 
tasting these reminded me of the old tv commercial :   where s the beef ?   . 
this leaves a sticky ,  hard hair spray life residue on my hair . 
i m now a hopeless addict to the power of the shirt . 
these mice seem to be incompatible with computers now . 
this is the num_extend num_extend filter i m talking about . 
it worked nicely for the first few months without a lot of noise . 
no one answered the phone at the ralph hagen co on saturday ,  midday . 
it wastes a lot of litter ,  pretty much just indiscriminately scooping everything in it s path into the bin . 
it still smells this way and i ve owned it for a year . 
i ve used this product for many years ,  only in the summertime ,  since i work outside . 
after two attempts  long drives  to enjoy this bottle i finally gave it to salvation army . 
despite the bad reviews ,  i had hoped deep down inside this would be a winner . 
never the less ,  i decided to give it a try for a few days opting for protection over fashion . 
he assured me all would be cured if i d only bathe myself daily in whole milk ,  preferably tuscan . 
i didn t like this product because it came broken . 
i wish i had read all the reviews before i bought this . 
this tastes weird in whatever i out it in . 
loved the color but it doesn t fit an otterbox like you would expect it too . 
i soo wish i never tried it !  my hair feels over processed ,  rough ,  dry and generally awful . 
he has a long attention span so i know this is a bad toy . 
all star qbs throwing balls out of bounds . 
keep in mind that the meal comes with a small packet of dried tofu ,  carrots and spinach topping . 
this item is absolutely dangerous to use on your dog . 
then ,  there can be some valuable family time . 
red mages almost cut it ,  but don t have a lot of hit points . 
the man i bought them for doesn t like them . 
i ve moved them around about num_num times looking for the sweet spots ,  no luck . 
many professions would complement each other and others would be completely different . 
even if he s wet ,  it doesn t do the job . 
it doesn t go over well ,  especially if you re watching someone else play the num_extend
so ,  i ll just keep the physical copy of it and reorder a new copy from online . 
this thing drives me nuts and wish i could get a refund . 
if that is your main issue with the bluetooth headsets ,  then this one is not for you . 
you can also purchase the microfiber rags and the spray bottle here on amazon . 
i would have given this num_num stars ,  but the high price knocked it down to num_extend
update :  last month  january  ,  the machine began to stop without pumping all the water through . 
the professional reviewers gets their games for free . 
if the product actually worked as a heating pad would probably be num_num or num_num stars . 
i am a professional computer technician and have worked inside pcs for num_num years . 
the warming plate has an auto shut off feature that is convenient . 
it randomly drops the connection with my isp and freezes ,  most of the time needing to be rebooted . 
num_num stars are just because they are easy and edible . 
i like being able to prop up the phone on my night stand . 
the barn doors didn t make noises when they were opened . 
i would never buy a waver like this one again . 
they are a great color of blue ,  the pink flowers are more pink than shown . 
i decided not to use it at the risk of damaging my equipment . 
it sits there like a little coffee pond . 
i guess i m the one who deserves the num_num star rating !  . 
each time it heated unevenly ,  either one side hard and the other soft or hard all the way around . 
like other reviewers i ve been on somewhat of a search for the holy grail of cheap headphones ,  i . e . 
the docs also said nothing about suggestions for improving am receptino . 
i figure i just wasted $ in grass . 
this may work great for those who have an occasional insomnia ,  but not so much in my case . 
order small and return it if you need to . 
i m going back to carhartt double fronts for my work and tactical wear needs . 
a person relying on this is setting themselves up for a catastrophic disaster . 
and yes i hit the reset button on the back . 
keep this with the batman dark tomorrow game . 
i thought it would be a friction mat ,  not a highly sticky mat . 
to me ,  it is definitely more powerful and substantial vacuum than the stick vacuum . 
to combat the hormone level drop during  placebo week  in the bcp month . 
she loves strawberry shortcake ,  but this thing just doesn t do it for her . 
you get what you pay for in this instance !  !  !  . 
the rayovac s nickel metal hydride  nimh  ,  so it s not toxic waste when spent . 
i live in nh and its dry in the winter . 
i can t even believe that amazon is carrying this item . 
this antenna worked no better than the cheap portable one that came with my miglia tvmini hd . 
if you need a spot cordless vacuum ,  look into the eureka num_extend
the knife blade is loose and moves inside the handle . i returned the first knife for replacement . 
i am now wary of all kettle products . 
what s more ,  there was none of the characteristic freshness that  bag  coffee typically has . 
i finally switched over to cisco and its been great . 
too bad burt s bees sold out to clorox . 
and i was so happy with it once i did . 
upon opening i found attachment shaft bent and beaters would not stay on shaft as something was missing . 
when moving from our apartment we somehow managed to lose the knife from it . 
i really wanted to find something eco friendly and safe for human use . 
in the long run ,  it was more of a bargain than the black and decker . 
i can t see the appeal to anyone but the most casual gamer or hardcore horror fan . 
if you aren t a handy person or don t have the tools ,  i would recommend avoiding this poorly designed product . 
the edges are sharp and the piece that holds the neck of the guitars is leaning too far back . 
i had this unit for about num_num months . 
num_num watt  candelabra base  incandescent light bulb $
if you make a lot of stiff doughs ,  this machine will become a num_num lbs paperweight . 
think someone installed the wrong jack during manufacture . 
ive heard raves about how coffee can help reduce eye puffiness and darkness so i gave this a try . 
i didn t like the previous one so i buy this cuz of all the good reviews . 
apparently works for some ,  but not for me . 
it left black sections and streaks all over the screen . 
these are laundry sheets that you dissolve in the sink water to wash you cloths . 
what works for one person or even most people may not work for you . 
the shine is not the best i ve ever seen . 
if you leave the sucker running for too long ,  it will hang during download . 
it does a fair job on medium oranges ,  and i suspect it will be ok for lemons . 
it s hard to put the plastic chips into the dispenser slot . 
the moon dough feels dry ,  and yet it sticks together and molds . 
disappointing that they turned a good product into a terrible one . 
my girls keep popping out of the bra ,  every time i move . 
this radio at least had push button tuning ,  but is far larger . 
i don t know why because the brush head that came with the toothbrush still looks and works fine . 
i ve come across a few people with the same case and the same problems . 
the dress was too big for an american girl doll . 
i wish the seller can read this maybe i still have time to return it . 
so ,  i don t know if i m given the wrong shirts !  thanks all the same . 
the cutscene outside the bridge of hyrule castle comes to mind here . 
i liked the top fill feature and the secure attachment to the cage  which are really good features  . 
i cannot get this to stay on my ear . 
unfortunately ,  it was difficult to close and ,  eventually , the top frame broke when removing it . 
even if gmos are not in it ,  i won t buy them anymore . 
once the new unit arrives i ll update this review . 
the second time i used them on bicep curls the handle popped off . 
overall ,  the build quality of the card is sound . 
i take mine on trips all over the world and even num_num mds is plenty . 
i could have the safety and the effectiveness combined . 
lots of problems and they never worked properly . 
would not recommend for cats ,  maybe dogs wouldn t mind it as much . 
i should have looked closer at the picture and noticed how skinny the grip handles were . 
if you can try it out ahead of the time ,  do yourself a favorite and do it . 
i love the clock and it is easy to program . 
bits continued to flake off during the simmer . 
my kids almost instantly switched to the keyboard . 
valve s choice not to support opengl further fuelled speculation that opengl may be badly lagging behind directx num_extend
these aren t potato chips ,  so you can t blame it on getting crushed in transit . 
it didn t feel natural to move and conduct basic movements and commands . 
they didn t burn or stick ,  and the silpat sheet cleaned up nicely as promised with only warm water . 
you will know what i mean if you foolishly purchase this game . 
then i tried baking soda and also vinegar . 
i can t understand how so many people liked this product . 
i had to rig it up to get it to stay in place . 
then when they do finally eat some ,  it tends to come back up again more than the others . 
blew it up when i got to camp ,  was totally deflated within num_num minutes . 
usually amazon is competitive in pricing but not on this line of products . 
i felt like i was playing another sega of the unreal franchise . 
no way around it ,  i don t care what any of you fan boys out there are saying . 
they stated in a email that they were sorry and would replace asap . 
the story line is so simple a num_num year old could ,  and might have ,  come up with it . 
sorry to say that i didn t really like it; though i m glad that it works for others . 
i don t own either ,  and i have no plans to buy them . 
as it is though ,  whether it s easy to install or not ,  crap is still crap . 
if you enjoy the look of wearing thick foundation ,  i guess this product would be good . 
get so , mething musch less expensive from your local pharmacy . 
i don t know why i bought it in the first place . 
it s a nice brush ,  but so much static . 
i say  would have  because i got rid of it . 
i finally traced the manufacturer on the web and was able to call them . 
maybe i just have a wierd head !  ha . 
it ll also hold your hair for a long period of time as well . 
can t because of the bad sony software that comes with it . 
when it was ground ,  there was no cleanup for my grinder :  no coffee oils were present . 
i agree with some of the other reviews ,  this product should be taken off the market . 
i wanted to start making my own fruit pops since i have a great juicer . 
this worked pretty good the clamp the phone would go into snapped in half . 
i have been a gamer for num_num years and am very familiar with shooters . 
i really can t recommend this to a novice . 
then you have to attend meeting after meeting with your position coaches ,  which is just plain not fun . 
my apartment is pretty dark and shaded and some days ,  i don t see much light . 
maybe that s a good amount of time but for almost $ i would expect more longevity . 
they offer a decidedly bland flavor with an aftertaste of old milk that lasts waaaay too long . 
i had previously purchased the wahl unit without the heating option and loved it . 
i will concur that it is beautifully designed  , has nice leather case and the fm section sounds decent . 
maybe part of it is the the artwork and design; the character animations look like weird cartoon figures . 
i d rather buy name brand like crosman or aftermath . 
she s a very content dog but she didn t want to stay in this . 
this item was great until it stopped working and that was in less than two months . 
a lot of area to push your foot through before you reach the footbed . 
so they could make glass jars to fit this purpose . 
i definitely got what i paid for ,  however . 
if i had to buy air mattresses again ,  i probably would avoid this brand . 
these parabens are readily absorbed through the skin and scalp ,  they are estrogenic ,  and build up in breast tissue . 
the old pokemon games had better graphics than this game . 
first of all this item cannot be returned because it s considered  grocery  . 
she will only play with this if i hold one side and pull against it . this thing needs doggy directions . 
so with that said ,  i thought it best to quit taking it . 
there were absolutely no new ideas or stage creativity or at any point in the game . 
had an older ar that a customer wanted work on so i bought this tool specifically for the job . 
on the new battery ,  i talked num_num min . 
maybe i am just use to good ones ,  but wow . 
i don t know what to think of this . 
mm had masks ,  oracle games had seeds and rings ,  minnish cap had kinship stones ,  etc . 
maybe i m not putting it on right or something . 
if you re an nba basketball player with gorilla hands it will be a perfect fit . 
after a month of using this product twice a day ,  i noticed no improvements ,  sadly . 
this app is virtually worthless and is full of bugs . 
ffekkai is a well know name but the product is not what i would want in a shampoo . 
i put this product on after i put on my moisturizer and my concealor . 
it is a little soft at the edges and at wide apertures . 
when the battery reached % it lost all power . 
we ve used it maybe num_num or num_num times . i hope i get my money back . 
cat batted it around for a couple of minutes then walked away . 
spend a few bucks more and get a good filter . 
i used other zagg products before and they all worked great . 
the thicker the hair the better this scent works !  . 
 the most common and immediate being chapping or dryness . 
creams etc either don t work for me ,  or also make my face beet red . 
somehow i m not at all satisfied with this palette felt its a total waste of my money . 
if you want to waste your money go ahead . 
good thing my baby was just happy to have some toys that are just his  new num_extend dog  . 
one could place it on top of their car or on the trunk as a  failsafe  . 
the unit looks good ,  but it will not work with windows num_extend
they were installed in my license plate and barely got them to work . 
why does levi change it cuts so often ?  . 
i guess it always helps to actually read the label fully before drinking . 
if you re a big granola connoisseur then you ll enjoy it ,  the casual granola eater wont be so pleased . 
he takes it into his mouth and then spits it back out . 
i thought i might be able to handle these but oh my god ,  it was disgusting . 
on my third and final use ,  i unknowingly got the metal plate off its track . 
could not get it to deliver water to the planter . 
they may be low cal ,  but it is because nobody can eat them !  . 
if you like to have a tasty bar ,  this is not for you . 
num_num countries around the world require that gmos be labeled . 
if your truly looking for pressure relief ,  look elsewhere . 
i got the xl ,  and it is way to small . 
i tried the dud cds on four total computers ,  so i know my technology is not at fault . 
would be almost comparable to carhartt belts if the buckle were fixed . 
i needed a vent mount so that it was closer to me and easier to see . 
when i first bought this game ,  i thought it would be great . 
i bought an up on the first day they were available . 
this thermometer is supposed to be more accurate . 
so far i have not seen any difference or improvement ,  it is waste of money . 
sadly ,  megaman num_extend is even worse than those two games . 
medal of honor rising sun is not worth the time it takes to get the shrinkwrap off . 
by the time you use a few of these products being reviewed ,  the rest will be discharged further . 
where is the story ?  where ?  it left with romero when he went to form ionstorm . 
it is extremely thin and porous ,  i don t see how this retains heat . 
it s hard to get on especially if it s on your tongue . 
i couldn t even figure out how to talk with this box . 
the picture for this item makes it look like it is chalk balls and not loose chalk . 
was hoping this was the one solid snap case . 
its very cheap compared to all the cases i have brought for the same price . 
best game ever ,  but i wanted to long to test it and couldn t return it . 
it is very uncomfortable having these rollers poking me in the back while sitting . 
the special effects for attack or defense spells and other weapons are ok . 
this stuff will not clear out your sinuses and i do not notice my breathing to be better . 
otherwise it looked like a nice stable dock ,  but who doesn t have a case on their phone nowadays ?  . 
i bought a book awhile back called how to toilet train your cat ,  very inexpensively . 
the velcro ripped after using it a few times . 
i m very fed up with the food industry . 
invest in something with more speed and you lll be happy . 
so why does a big company release a cd that never should have left quality control . 
now the fiber optics part of it is pretty cool but thats about it . 
this product has turned out to be a big zero for me . 
the shipping took a while too but that is because it s from hong kong . 
i didn t have another dog to test it on ,  so i ended up returning it . 
they are running out of ideas they need to takesome ideas from there fans . 
my iphone cable needed to be replaced because the wires were exposed . 
i think half of these reviews are probably people that are paid to do it . 
as others have written ,  the range is very poor . 
there was some irregular stitching on that shoe ,  as well . 
this game is revolutionary in the history of computer gaming . 
if i have been unfortunate enough to save my configuration during this corruption then that too is corrupted . 
there is something seriously wrong with this product . 
the same grinding sounds from rails and cement . 
compre unos num_extend y parece que fueran como num_extend porque son grandisimos y me quedan super anchos . 
i really wanted to like this and was excited to receive it but i just couldn t eat it . 
runs large for a mens ring as well . 
just for me hair milk works better for far less money and is less iky feeling . 
i bought this based on the num_num reviews here . 
leapfrog recommends you clean the ball with a damp cloth ,  but that doesn t always produce the best results . 
this is my num_extend tonka rc vehicle and it is a major step backwards in toy evolution . 
i have found that the pyramid series of tea from lipton is bland and flavorless . 
if you skip the ring there is an extra piece of collar that will be flapping in the wind . 
while it won t look quite so fancy ,  the feel won t be all that different . 
dim naturally contains compounds which can smell badly ,  in some cases like fecal matter . 
if you do purchase i would not suggest using them inside ,  it ate the finish on my coffee table !  . 
second ,  the steering knob needs to be larger ,  adjustable ,  and attach to the pole instead of the top handle . 
since i bought a num_num pack , i am trying to figure out what to do with these . 
i have tried an times but no luck . 
when this works it does have a sharp blade that splits pills in half . 
island dreams by figi is about $ on line and it gets you brown very fast . 
one has to wonder who wrote this contradictory packaging copy and who approved it . 
i ll have to pass on any further purchases . 
this uses a ti chipset which ti refuses to release any information about to the linux driver writers . 
they actually caused more fluid to be inside and more plugging up . 
it s like the old  games  used to be where there are only so many  burned into the led  images . 
that s not what i m looking for in a dinner . 
got all the way to the end and couldn t get the game to finish . 
i discontinued using the product ,  because it was too messy . 
the cut out in the case isn t big enough and my charger pops out . 
my mistake to have not looked close enough ,  beyond the num_extend power magnification . 
i decided to buy some on a whim from this company and i was thoroughly disappointed . 
i would not recommend this toy to any one . 
this is a decent game  the only reason i gave it num_num stars  . 
this is the shoddiest drink i ve had in a long time . 
i took away another star because of this . just received a ballistic case and tossed the vertex case . 
again ,  these breyer accessories are a waste of money for use as a toy being so poorly constructed . 
the audio was cutting in and out frequently . 
i want to choose my default search engine . 
my daughter loves this toy ,  and so do we ,  when it works . 
it s inexpensive which in this case equates to poor quality . 
i took it inside and when i sat on it  at num_num pounds  it barely makes a dimple . 
while the machine works well ,  it is very ,  very heavy . 
the straps have no adjustments and are too short and i am only num_extend tall . 
i had loved the zelda series ,  but was dismayed when i saw wind waker . 
the stopwatch ,  for instance ,  is a nightmare to use . 
we weren t expecting that ,  they re thin rubber ,  you shouldn t expect it either . 
i will even eat rice cakes ,  which are pretty styrofoamy . 
the blood and violence is just to intense . 
my laptop was overheating soo i decided to buy a fan ,  but it doesn t work . 
and to move around the  beautiful  levels with any sort of ease . 
the terrain is green ,  with some very sparsely placed trees and signs . 
the bad news is that the game is a chore to get through thanks to a terrible frame rate . 
unless you press it as hard as you can to make it buck . 
the face of the phone is completely exposed . 
will be getting laser surgery on my veins . 
bright blue light is larger and more visible than other bluetooth headphones . 
when i contest a player for three they just put up a prayer and make it . 
as is stand ,  i really can t recommend this to anyone . 
accordingly i thought it would be a good idea to update my review . 
when i tested it to see if it worked my computer always lost power and restarted . 
it is very flimsy and is just not a good case . 
i heard these are great ,  but i don t know how to use them . 
as to product performance ,  i tried several attachments ,  and cut or grated romaine ,  carrots ,  scallions ,  cucumber ,  celery . 
maybe someone has more practical ideas ?  sure would like to hear of them . 
and the bad thing is that it didn t even work well enough to make it worth the stench . 
so perhaps it tracks about the same as any litter . lastly ,  the poor clumping action . 
look at kong chew toys instead for longer lasting toys . 
i thought this would fit my num_num ipaq but doesn t . 
i mean ,  it helps but doesn t reduce it enough to make it comfortable to shoot num_num to num_num shells . 
did these people even test this thing ?  the range leaves something to be desired . 
the grind was uneven ,  with some beans barely cut in half ,  despite the length of grinding time . 
they successfully utilized sound  or the lack thereof  to scare the bejeezus out of me . 
i finally realized the lid given for the large pan just wasn t even close to fitting . 
i used this product for the first time and was very disappointed . 
unfortunately it feels like a rock under the band . 
for what should be simple consumer electronic devices . 
i shouldn t have overlooked someone s review on rust issue with these pans . 
i can t hear the shaker ,  the sizzling cymbals as clear as before . 
it does not tilt straight up or down like the small table fans you traditionally see . 
i ordered this gasket in hopes that it would fit and was overjoyed when it did . 
so the part in the back where the mirror attaches to the metal can t be tightened . 
i ask one of this used item nv and it arrived me with damage or bad . 
i don t necessarily like throwing all of those batteries away when there are rechargables . 
one would think it should not be difficult to take the temperature reading . 
oils will leach plastic from the container over time ,  so that is a concern to me . 
the refurb couldn t do internet except through wifi . 
i am very surprised that so many people are happy with this knife . 
i no longer experience numbness down south . if this one doesn t do the trick for you ,  check out the competition . 
when you are handicapped you have more trouble returning them . 
my guess is anodized aluminum not suitable . generally zyliss makes quality kitchen tools . 
we ended up buying a capresso and have been very happy with that instead . 
this case is not specifically made for the htc inspire . 
it did not taste like the jasmine tea i so remember and appreciate . 
the colors are less vibrant than i imagined . 
this looked much easier to handle than advertised . 
since the product is still being offered ,  i thought my review might help some to make a decision . 
finally ,  using this as a pointer takes a lot more movement . 
the metal on this rack is not protected and it digs into the rim leaving very destructive marks . 
when they work they are fine . revised bottom line :  ya pays ya money and ya takes ya chances . 
ended up purchasing a sear craftsman pump for $ that has a larger compressor and a built in light . 
even before mealtime ,  he just walks away ,  not even a sniff . 
it cleans your hair ,  but doesnt help it . 
sorry ,  just swinging around ny could not save this one . 
my husband and i tried everything possible to try to fix it to no avail . 
had the unit num_num months before one port died . 
however ,  the mission  rabaul raid  cannot be won and campaign stops there . 
sesame ,  flax and hemp are my superfood but almonds are the superfood when it comes to vitamin e . 
if you want to put ear muffs or even a hat down over them you will bump them . 
other reviews make a big deal about the great flavor . 
this is the most useles piece of junk on the market . 
its best used for hardwood floors and tile but forget it if you want to use it for carpets . 
when i put it in the  off  position ,  it turned on . 
the tea tree cleansing conditioner did much better with her hair . 
if you hand hold it you must keep a finger around it to keep the connection . 
the first one stopped working after about eight months . 
i wouldn t recommend using this screen cover if screen resolution is important to you . 
i received a num_num oz sample of this in my new beauty test tube . 
it wasn t too sweet ,  so in that aspect i wouldn t  and didn t  mind giving it to my boy . 
you have to glue in plastic pieces for the camera and apple logo window .

if this feature was implemented for storyline purposes only ,  i wouldn t have a problem with it . 
if you have msg sensitivities or related migraines ,  don t buy this . 
i started playing the game and thought :  i don t like this game but maybe it will get better . 
thee first quit responding to any input at all after a couple of weeks . 
plus ,  the only thing that came in handy was its outer shell ,  because the outlet did not work . 
this satin mask was very cheaply made and very uncomfortable to wear . 
and don t accept the offer from the suppllier   to cut open a bigger opening  to make it fit !  . 
gave it to my son as the humidity where he lives is different than here . 
when i received the first one ,  upon inserting the batteries ,  only five of the buttons lit up . 
my husband uses cutter backyard bug control spray for the lawn and has been very pleased with the results . 
i bought these because they look beautiful in the picture . 
next time i ll read the reviews even when i think i don t have to . 
the more you attempt to fix it the more streaky it becomes . 
it doesn t come anywhere close to ff num_extend
that game cannot be played any other way but by a computer . 
i can t give a fair review on this ,  because i haven t used it yet . 
i returned it for a refund and will have to look aroung elsewhere . 
this one does not have that holding power to keep away hunger until lunch time that i m looking for . 
or check out  the shadowhearts covenant  ,  the last installment in the shadowheart series . 
this bra offered no support for my num_extend
added september num_extend num_extend well ,  i think this treadmill has reached the end of its life .

i can see this is going to be a pain in the ass . 
i cant get it to fly forward ,  even indoors . 
i returned it but was not able to get refund or exchange . 
it does not leave enough room for me to sit . 
also ,  the lens thing ,  or whatever it is ,  is fixed at a certain height . 
it smelled like pure alcohol and made my hair feel sticky and rough . 
i will never order from these people again if this is how they take care of their customers . 
i never disapproved a product as i disapprove this one . waste of money . 
different animations don t equal depth or variety in gameplay . 
and when i wanted to switch ,  it took a num_num hour set up . 
it s a real shame that the game itself actively works to destroy suspension of disbelief . 
scoop surface appears to be chrome but not . 
the other two started to peel off just from daily use . 
they are distructive chewers and this looked like it might last them a while . 
i repackaged it ,  and it is going back . total let down . 
then it started interfering with the network ,  i . e . 
in the honey world theres a graphical glitch where all the honey stops flowing too . 
however ,  it s just too hard to be tasty . 
afraid i wouldn t be able to get the smell out  . 
my german shepherd is incredibly picky when it comes to treats . 
the vhs playback ,  however ,  was horrible on both machines . 
speaking of range ,  it only works for about num_num to num_num feet . 
next they tried to put the blame on the postal service for damaging the screen . 
i thought maybe i somehow had a bad cup ,  so i tried a different tea bag . 
our golden puppy is a killer of plush toys ,  so the lack of stuffing was a huge selling point . 
there is a white film all over my apartment and throughout my oven . 
crocs shoes are a different animal than most shoes . 
don t buy them because of the low price . 
my hair became dry and thin as well . 
not going to be a third time as they will be going in the trash soon . 
i should ve known :  resistance in a wire gets higher the longer the wire ,  and since resistance produces heat . 
buy any other transformers game just not this . 
but it never got past the soupy slush stage . 
but shooting at them is not at all fun . 
there really isn t a lot to say here . 
also ,  we re very clumsy and haven t chipped a piece after num_num months of use . 
not really my taste but gave them away the guy loves them . 
return policy is poor and shipping is high so make sure you are not going to return these shorts . 
it s a fight trying to get the molds to pop up with the sticks . 
however ,  when it arrived ,  i noticed it was in a plastic container . 
i have been carrying this knife for about two months . 
my button actually stopped working and i had to exchange the phone . 
the smell was delightfully herbal with a touch of florals . 
and guess what ?  it still played like crap . 
one is fine ,  the other must have been flawed because it basically unraveled . 
even an strong person will have difficulties with this scale . 
so this would not only be bad for her health but also bad for my wallet . 
if they did ,  i would snatch up both of them . 
i have a charger for my power outlet in my car . 
then it started to warm less and less . 
right now i have them in a normal inustrial clamp style lamp from a big box store . 
it does not work well at all it stays gooey no matter what you do . 
i ve come to expect more than this of oxo . 
it did not do anything to my skin other than major break outs . 
this little wallet smelled so strongly that i had to put it outside . 
i got it yesterday ,  opened the packaging and immediately applied the screen protector . 
and getting leaner each year  by other tests  . this device assumes body fat percentage goes up with age . 
i guarantee you it would work better than this marker . 
the whites are white ,  reds are red ,  and blacks are black . 
it pulls the hair rather than cutting it . 
and i don t mean it on a  mature content present  way . 
i think i came in last every time . 
they are still laying around my house uneaten ,  untried ,  untouched . 
i m disappointed since i enjoy other flavors of larabars . 
this product claims to restore black trim and lasts for two weeks . 
i got it as a bonus product for buying a roaster . 
my first thought was these are going back . 
i was not impressed with the quality of it for the amount i paid for it . 
various plastic parts completely broke off after a little more than a year . 
after two or three washings ,  these socks shrank and became hard . 
i bought these for use by my kids ,  since i wanted to get away from using plastic cups . 
you can look up the website of parry on google . 
considering going to a restaurant supply store and investing in a professional set of cookware . 
of course you ll learn a new move as you progress but nothing to boost about . 
be clear that if water gets on the phone lifeproof does not cover the damage to your phone . 
i even tried wiping some off on a tissue ,  but it was just a gummy mess . 
although the product causing it was also the same product she thought was fixing it . 
maybe i ll just use this as a pen holder or something else . 
i wanted to be able to watch videos on my ipad and still answer my phone with these . 
cable crackles when plug in jack is moved .

i purchased the devacurl travel kit so that i could sample this product i had heard so much about . 
i purchased the product even with all the negative reviews . 
based on the reviews ,  i bought num_num of these as gifts . 
i have ,  and had great luck with honest sellers and a great product . 
they had me down load and install the same driver over again ,  several times . 
now ,  after a year and a half ,  the pump mechanism just died . 
i normally wear large so i ordered xl and can t even get my fingers half way in . 
no more sticky residue after cleaning ,  and no overwhelming scent . 
thankfully i saved the old cord he had used previously to connect . 
i thought i had found a real bargain when i purchased this pan but i was wrong . 
the shiny parts were still shiny when i finished using it ,  and the dull parts were still dull . 
not a big fan ,  just use a credit card instead . 
i don t buy anything with chicken or rice for my dogs . 
it seems so obvious to me that i have to wonder what the developers were thinking . 
then ,  the folding handle ,  low and behold ,  broke in half one morning . 
maybe this is just a bad batch ?  not sure ,  but i won t be trying anymore of it . 
i couldn t wear them out of the house . 
it s fun to battle in  despite it s graphics  . 
no graham cracker taste or texture . it tastes like the chocolate chip cookie dough .  .  . and colored a bit darker . 
basically this is granulated catnip . unfortunately i want to get rid of cats ,  not get more of them . 
it does not work with the rca rc num_extend which amazon is bundling with it . 
however ,  i fixed mine by replacing the screws with longer sheet metal screws . 
this is a horrible product ,  didn t even work on one bottle for me . 
large oversized box with small set of num_extend
but on obagi ,  when one started resolving ,  another would pop up . 
this game suffers from such slow game play it is a wonder it was ever released . 
i loved how soft it was and the texture was great . 
hard to believe anyone would put something so awful on the market . 
we got rid of it after one month since willa cannot understand any commands . 
i ever had experience with this technology and so far i m not impressed at all . 
the whole idea of this design is ingenious . 
checkpoint saves are made automatically although you can save manually at any point . 
a little way into the second batch ,  it started smoking . 
i m very disappointed that seido doesn t make a cradle for rezound . 
this is a product i bought without reading the reviews . 
the bulk of the game ,  however ,  is simply beating up your enemies . 
i was looking forward to getting this bra ,  i like the look of lace . 
i could care less about snapping that guy ,  i only have num_num arms . 
you can buy food to speed up health regeneration ,  but again ,  this only works in the tavern . the world . 
just a personal preference but it doesn t interfere that much with the functionality of the knife . 
i followed the directions by first filling it with the cleansing solution then using it as a dry vac . 
plus for them . cons : wireless range :  the range on these headphones is hideously poor . 
once again ,  puffy itchy eyes . so trash can it went !  . 
i tried another one just to see if i got a dud . 
i like to replace my cardboard coins with metal coins ,  but they are fairly expensive . 
it worked fine for about the first month then the clogs and the stench started . 
would have expected it to last longer though . 
it looks very stylish and real ,  and it a semi and full auto airsoft gun . 
i was hoping it would help with antidepressant induced ed . 
seems they jack it up in the spring . 
but on the plus side the graphics are fantastic and not very glitchy the only decent character is koko . 
if you jog backwards it won t zoom . there s probably more ,  i just never wrote them all down . 
when i got home ,  i put in num_num agent under fire and the memory card . 
get a nice screen protector and you will be far happier . 
i am surprised at the number of high marks given by other reviewers . 
yes that is the only problem .  .  . it does not blend . 
i wish i could give num_num stars ,  but i can t . 
i guess it s just any other moisturizer but not worth a higher price than a drug store product . 
enter a new area :  talk to the pc . 
tried connecting cable from my sound card on my pc to my speakers and it just buzzes and pops . 
now if rocket just wouldn t fall apart while he s running around . 
but i ve had to go back to using my wired keyboard . 
this would go a long way towards restoring their brand image . 
it s a great softening agent in the same way as this product . 
when you take the bar out of the wrapper ,  you ll see what i mean . 
i ordered it because it was highly recommended on the food network and also on the travel channel . 
at the gun range ,  they definitely keep the sound down ,  but it s the little things that it s missing . 
i assumed that this must be a bad base . 
either way ,  i won t risk trying a replacement cable ,  and ,  for this price ,  i probably won t bother returning this . 
when my first one started falling apart after num_num years of use i decided to buy a new one . 
when on ,  the current drain increases to num_num ma . 
need to return; dogs irritate eyes and cant be used on them . 
the concept behind this bag is a good one . 
i took them to my neighbors and put the same dvd in their dvd player and they played . 
if the bread is of a lighter constituency ,  it may not fully bake on the top . 
just today i overheard somebody s conversation about wanting to buy a razr and i discouraged her from doing so . 
the other issue is that the tops of the sticks are just not sticky enough . 
for me ,  this was just about enough to get the taste ,  and then they were gone . 
this was tested with a blackberry and a motorola cell phone on both speakers i bought . 
needless the say ,  the third order as well . 
even then it dials the wrong number half the time . 
we bought these traps ,  put peanut butter on them . 
so i was using this shaving cream and absolutely loved it . 
when i first introduced beneful everyone dug in . 
shuffle the cards and put them face down in rows . 
i let my hair air dry and it was left feeling knotted and greasy . 
i tried this canner several times and every time the lid was a struggle to remove . 
used three of the five that it comes with . not worth it . 
i probably won t order them again for me . 
even though i rated everything else high ,  i really dislike this game . 
it is a nice looking watch but the watch would reset the time and date after a bit . 
this was a very bad ideal for a large older cat . 
it dyed my roots the awful neon purple color and then the rest was a light putrid purple . 
i just saw that it was blueberry and didn t realize it would taste more like nuts than blueberries . 
i would try another form of training instead of this method . 
but they are more like ducks in a shooting gallery . 
my two year old chihuahua mix ,  jake ,  responded to it . 
he only uses the teeth chew ,  and the other piece at the top . 
will not purchase and not recommend to anyone . 
my dog is too big for this toy . 
nonsense !  i was starting to think it was feeding the fleas because those bloodthirsty suckers just wouldn t die . 
bought a whole bunch of these in black ,  grey ,  and blue . 
the sprinkle maker was my least favorite part of it . 
it makes the product useless and a nice paper weight . 
i ve ordered online for these snacks ,  but this was my first time with this supplier . 
i didn t give sonic adventure num_num a num_num star review because many people , including my own brother enjoyed this game . 
i ll probably replace it with a logitech mouse before too much longer . 
after their bath and blow dry their  cuddle factor  is over the top . up date . 
long detours are required to travel between nearby locations . 
i mean if it shows up before feb ill rate this differently . 
used once ,  wiped it out to use again . 
i know it s my fault for assuming ,  but i thought it had cards slots on the cover . 
they were much larger than i imagined by the photo . 
i have tried to use this popcorn gadget on several microwave settings . 
with regular use they don t dry properly and begin to smell funky . 
my point in telling all of this is that these slippers held up great . 
hearing the massive hype ,  i fell for this games ruse and bought it . 
i was going to use it to prop up my phone at work but went with another option instead . 
i had a new phone for about three weeks before dropping it for the first time . 
one line is the only good product ,  like imonster from walmart . 
the only upside to num_extend is the graphics and that it . 
i m very pale so that could be a big reason . 
i purchased a sony num_extend to play video games . 
i would say the are brittle ,  not durable . 
so ,  what s the point ?  this toy just does not work . 
organic vegetable product from pacific natural foods ,  which makes the other product we love so much . 
all this game has to offer is running around and knocking things over and slaying things . 
while the store brands tear evenly since the seams are vertical . 
to dump the water out into the sink ,  you have to unplug it . 
it smells bad and has a chalky texture . 
this time ,  it wouldn t even play the disc . 
loud ,  there is no change in humidity level even if you run it on max speed in tiny room . 
as others have said ,  it is rife with indentations; nooks and crannies . 
there s some solid questions ,  but the way the game is set up it becomes confusing and monotonous pretty quickly . 
the  locks  on the case are extremely hard to open and close . 
i am always having to go into the bathroom and pull it down or readjust during the day . 
too bad because i feel great after i drink it . 
most of the kit is still in the bag in the closet . 
for years i have used a conair or wigo paddle brush with nylon bristles and a plastic handle . 
not sure it is even worth it to pay for them darn things to be sent back . 
it wears easily and now it doesn t look that nice . 
imagine if you had a piece of blueberry pie while you were out at a nice hillside picnic . 
i virtually never have trouble with damaged goods . 
i got this today and opened it right away for my golden retriever . 
they are all very lightweight and easy to toss out of the way ,  too . 
the itchiness soon after i out it on . 
i found it to be thick and sticky . 
now i cant trust buying something like this from here . 
suggest thoroughly testing these upon arrival if you purchase these . 
overall it was functional while it lasted ,  but was always annoying to use . 
i found this out by research on the internet . 
applied the patch and rubbed it down very hard . 
in that time ,  it sputtered and coughed like an asthmatic trucker . 
might be best to try one box first . 
i didn t like the matte finish at all and quickly replaced these with another type . 
i found chocoperfections bars satisfy the sweet craving . 
need more quality control before i buy these again . 
i bought it to manage my low thyroid . 
then when it finally came it was broken and there was rhinestones in the packaging . 
bought it for around $ to supplement my tiny grinder . 
i hit them with all head and body shots . 
i was ripped off with this ,  i dont recommend it !  it didn t last not even one week it . 
as well ,  a new design will most likely have a fresher date . 
this is one of those things i can honestly say you just shouldn t buy . 
i m probably better off jogging in a sport bra . 
for this product to work properly ,  you have to have tension on either side of the wrapping paper . 
grease leaks from the joint of the worm . 
you can t shoot your friends in the back of the head ,  which my fellow gamers appreciated greatly . 
after num_num out of num_num burns resulted in errors ,  i thought that something might be amiss . 
and onions get stuck on the blades and you have to open it to get it free . 
these pills ran my blood pressure up and caused me to be a little gittery . 
i went to walmart and purchased a cover for a uniflame grill which fits and has velcro straps . 
potentially a good knife if it locked like the original post stated . 
give it a pass unless you have a small animal using this ,  like a kitten or maybe a rabbit . 
felt and looked like a good kitchen item when it arrived . 
however ,  if you just like playing the games ,  i honestly must say for you to pass this up . 
i used it with yes to tomatoes shampoo . 
i ve previously used body washes by aveeno ,  alba ,  nature s gate and yes to carrots ,  with no ill effects . 
this product should have been sent to me num_num weeks ago and i ve still not received it . 
it was hard to use and didn t make my tongue feel any better . 
basically think lunchables without the need to be placed into the fridge . 
what i actually received was giant chunks of cocoa butter instead of little discs for easy measuring . 
this spray  like the deva curl mister right  ,  left my hair feeling sticky . 
one storm system can bring dozens of alerts to a county . 
the missions could have been great but ,  the poor environment detail and overall reality just cannot be overlooked . 
wand is so flimsy and hard to hold for an adult let alone a child . 
tiny mirror ,  couldn t figure out how to work it . 
i never understood why this happened ,  it just did . it s not a very good game . 
fits three small cans across ,  or two standard size with quite a bit of wasted space . 
thq boasts a gameworld larger than both zeldas combined ,  and this is certainly true . 
i wouldn t recommend these shoes even for the price . 
i am not satisfied with this productat all for many reason after all . 
the base is not heavy enough to balance the num_extend on it . 
i can only speak of my very limited experence using these . 
the idea of no more wires was exciting to me when i got my new consoles . 
let me explain :  when you slam your opponent ,  her face is completely submeged in the mud . 
i m fairly sure this product is the cause . 
i ordered this from qvc and i have used it several times ,  not terribly impressed ,  particularly with the price . 
as a result ,  your ground sausage meat ends up getting ground again by the worm feeder . 
the makeup came with a thick black stripe across the jar . 
i really didn t notice elmo on the package ?  these are for kids more than adults . 
when a lens clearly does not meet those high standards ,  i return it . 
i can t see any reason why anyone would want this toy anywhere around them . 
the material just seems too rough for that . anywho ,  so far ,  this is a bust . 
a month was not long enough to teach my new dog not to bark . 
other than that ,  these bags have been frustrating in the extreme !  . 
i ended up with my rechargeable batteries scratched not that i care num_extend
i thought if i left num_num spare mags in it for a while it would loosen up .  .  . nope . 
when i heard a new spyro game was out ,  i happily rented it . 
i do not recommend this screen protector to anybody . 
further ,  the dough began sticking to the machine and wouldn t go through fully . 
its a flimsy piece of plastic that will easily crack if flexed . 
procedure :  took off the cover and gently spun the mechanism . 
she had to check with a supervisor twice to finally discover the problem . 
frankly ,  i was quite surprised listening to them . 
it s safe to say that the  original  fans of ape escape were pretty shocked when they played this game . 
when it begins to fail ,  the digital display on the control will flash on and off . 
the next day ,  again ,  i was only given the above num_num parts . 
i expanded this to maximum length num_extend to hold my num_extend planter that already had herbs growing in it . 
but it simply could not manage the job . 
it does actually do what it says but expect certain things . 
this cooked the eggs ,  but completely destroyed them in the process . 
they are too big ,  awkward ,  and too fragile to take outside of the home . 
this is one of the most obnoxious toys my children have ever been given . 
the result is dropping this over and over ,  and it is now in pieces . 
i don t know ,  but it will be my last . 
since my cat prefers the fish and seafood flavors i thought this would be terrific . 
please be careful with these cubes .  .  . i would hate to see another kitty go through what christmas did . 
the  wheel  ,  which holds your wiimote ,  is sturdy but it s not easy to steer at all . 
after used it a while ,  it starts losing left speaker sound and it diminished volume . 
the shirt fit well ,  but the buttons are located in a weird layout . 
unfortunately this is not compatible with nexus num_extend
i ve broken chains before but not this new . 
yes ,  this item is convenient at measuring liquids . 
this is a very cute case but it does not fit my phone very good .

also ,  those machines you can rent from the grocery store are a lot more powerful . 
i ve read forums where many have had problems with starforce and had more problens when trying to remove starforce . 
they sent me the nj legal ,  watered down version . 
sadly ,  it appears they focus on the surface appeal of their products and scrimp on the actual functionality . 
worth trying out or buying when the price is nice and low . 
when it comes to a boil ,  let it roll for about num_num seconds . 
you chose a vehicle ,  raced like mad and picked the most opportune time to crash . 
there is nothing about it that sticks out . avoid this game . 
once you ve pointed at the thing ,  you just shoot it . 
wrong !  !  !  !  there is about num_num charactors missing from the num_num version for some unknown reason . 
big mistake on my part shelling out money for this on the basis of what i read . 
this lens has paint on it !  this lens makes noise . 
i started with liquid fertilizers then realized they would get expensive and switched . 
my cat wont play with it at all ,  so i will have to give it away . 
but it does not fit well ,  i bought it this on sale and did not try for a month . 
i kinda thought they were doing something wrong . 
but ,  motorola has a battery recharge pack that does the trick without being connected to a power source . 
i m guessing that the maple syrup added to the mix has ,  at some point crystallized . 
add the cost of the  jet clean  fluid and i would not buy that toy again . 
let s face it ,  all mario parties stink ,  but this is just plain horrible . 
all we need is an independent and vetted impartial nutrition laboratory to really find out for us . 
i d give this game num_num stars if that was possible . 
time to extinguish buildings ,  defeat monsters or villains ,  and just make sure metropolis s health bar doesn t reach zero . 
depending on the quality of your knives and technique ,  these might be ok . 
if they had a standard two pole tent they could have simply picked it up and moved it . 
after one minute ,  she just left it on the floor to play with a ball or chew bone instead . 
don t buy something just because it is made by a reputable company . 
it did absolutely nothing for my fine hair . 
plus the hinge is designed to be more durable . 
the connection balls are too spongy and they really don t hold a shade to support itself . 
yes ,  it is more expensive ,  but i don t have to clean up hulls . 
i would spend a few extra dollars to get a descent cable . 
the case fits great but it only covers the back of the iphone .

an enemy pops up and pelts me with bullets . 
i thought perhaps the cd was bad ,  so i burned another one .

not a single song is complete and i don t understand why . 
i bought some sort of protein treatment from this company years ago and it made my hair hard . 
i guess you get what you pay for .

i have had one for about a year ,  and i ve never used it . also ,  they are bulky . 
ok it could happen i got the one bad filter on the rack ,  but unlikely . 
i used this in place of sugar for things like iced tea and coffee . 
so i am upgrading to a steamer which allows me to do this . 
or wait for it to hit the bargain bin ,  it ll be there in a few weeks . 
it is not repairable . i bought them because of the volume control and travel case . 
it most certianly does not do as advertised !  mostly worthless . 
however ,  it now has a huge rip in the seam after less than num_num months of moderate use . 
i found that other people have had the same problem by searching the internet . 
i wanted to try this  gb special  since the price was right at under seven dollars . 
after moving some of the kibble ,  i could see right away that the motor was barely moving . 
the primary ingredient is oats ,  followed closely by corn syrup . 
wonderful in theory but the pack i received today has a best used by date within num_num days . 
that also includes any funcom game including their upcoming mmorpg . 
anyone who owns or has played ssx num_num would know . 
now we ll see whether the racks begin to  sag  as quickly as the toaster in the september review . 
i used passion flower befor this is tne worst . 
also ,  the strong odor holds the dog s concentration and makes it difficult to attend to what i am instructing . 
the base is loose and falls over all the time . 
that s why sega s num_extend saga is the new and better generation of baskerball games . 
so ,  the beginning of this game is not too bad ,  and i was mildly interested in the gameplay . 
reading the discussion forum gives you an idea of the huge number of problems this game has . 
so i will continue taking him to the groomers ,  it s easier on both of us !  . 
the rockout sounds muffeled ,  because of the way it is designed . 
you can t send a kid s gift in a plain brown box . 
as in ,  well a straight line of gameplay . 
i d suggest buying the smallest bottle and giving it a try before stocking up on it . 
if i could use it with no smell ,  i might like it better . 
fun for a bit ,  but not for hours and hours of filler . 
my tub is an oval and regardless of how hard i try it will not stick . 
the brush you get may look nothing like this brush . 
you can drop a badguy in some ways so the others ignore his death ,  even walking over the body .

i feel the cardo is a better unit for comperable price . my first bluetooth was a motorola . 
i do not know if he will eventually like it ,  but i will update if that is the case . 
the paint job was either very poor ,  or this knife was a used knife . 
finally it seemed to be securley fastened to my rear rack bars . 
it is also very light weight which adds to the instability . 
the cups extend to the side fine but there is no room for the breast to fill the cup . 
the time display along with the auto and program features are not illuminated and hard to read . 
we also use atopica as recommended by the vet . 
it s no wonder the pan arrived in pieces . 
i don t know what happened but i d say that reef s standards are falling . 
didn t find that this product did anything for me . 
terrible !  !  !  !  !  i was so loyal to this brand and this flavor but i cannot drink it anymore . 
oh !  this game was so boring and not entertaining at all !  i uninstalled this game from my pc . 
since some guests prefer sugar or unsweetened ,  i normally add sweetener when i pour a glass of tea . 
these insoles give a lot of support across the arch ,  thats the good part . 
i intially tried to make it work with just two people that is simply not possible with this game . 
i walk a lot and this shoe was not good for me . 
it seems to be a good buy for some but i m passing .

there are two tracks and it happens on both of them . 
i went out to a store and found a much more comfortable pair of headphones . 
you pay for what you get i guess lol . 
she ll chew on them for a few minutes and leave them . 
i contacted regency wraps before i bought these ,  and this is not silicone ,  nor is it parchment . 
it feels cheap and a bit rigid ,  almost like plastic . 
i m not slamming the game itself ,  but rather their policy . 
shouldn t have done that .  and so far ,  i can t even get the game to play . 
a couple of years ago nintendo stated that gamers didn t care about playing games online . 
i stopped by friday afternoon  the next day  to check on him . 
not !  i have warned others that kitchen aid is turning junk out at premium price . 
this  dock  was like doing brain surgery to get placed properly to charge . 
it plays cd but it takes a second or num_num to skip to songs . 
i m totally donating this to goodwill and getting a different one . 
yes ,  they contain sulfites ,  but that makes them pliable and easy to cut up for cooking . 
i had no problem locating an active mole path and installed the trap . 
based on my experience ,  i cannot advise anyone to purchase it . 
passable if you add hot sauce and tortilla chips . 
just not worth it . personal opinion ,  pass on this one . 
its awful !  !  tiny items and most have ended up or will be in the recycle bin . 
i bought these for just under $ a few months ago . 
i have enjoyed playing adventure games ,  like those by dreamcather .

to be honest ,  what worked for me was taking biotin every day . 
i am usually a size lare; however ,  i ordered xxl to have a bit of extra room . 
i didn t like the feel of the hair . 
it was very fresh and chewy but really has no flavor outside of a slightly chemical taste . 
unless your hog or coon hunting at night it is nearly unusable . 
the eye chart is adorable ,  but could have been placed lower . 
had i read all the other reviews , i would have not made this purchase . 
it was not the worst thing i ever ate but not all that good either . 
this gum completely loses its flavor within num_num minutes ,  maybe less . 
this product that i purchased on amazon smells different and has a totally different color . 
that said ,  it is very effective against light . 
this is num_extend either as stated .  .  . it is num_extend i believe .  .  . pretty shitty steel . 
it came out sloppy ,  and thus was just a waist of money and time . 
i this this product would work really well with a second person involved to apply the product . 
if i want a more natural product ,  i am going to do some more thorough research next time out . 
i m a car guy who used to own a custom detail shop and who has his cars detailed regularly . 
i also noticed that the drink left a slight yellowing on my mug which i had to scrub off . 
i would definately think about renting this game ,  but avoid purchasing it . 
you will be mind blown with the finished product and it will last much longer . 
i even found some in my bedroom down the hall this morning . 
now i have to spend more money and find a real white . 
just be certain you are willing to pay to only get half of what is advertised .

your car will drive through anything and everything . 
the problem with star trek games is that they try to be too much like star trek . 
amazon prime shipping is priceless for any parent . 
hermione can access tight spaces that the others can t . 
it always feathers and balls up on my skin . 
i have had good luck with similar suction hooks ,  but this one didn t want to work for me . 
i used this a few times and my hair looked really dirty and greasy afterwards .

this case arrived flat ,  not what i wanted . 
sometimes the blades pop off ,  occasionally with the spring in tow ,  and i have to start over again . 
this caddy serves the purpose of holding a sponge and a liquid dishwashing soap . 
the worst part of this mascara was not it s performance . 
we get together another time and play one of the other box scenarios . 
and when i went to make coffee ,  it spewed steam everywhere . 
i have a few complaints but really it s not worth discussing them all . 
it was easy to screw together and required zero tools . 
you rarely see the phantom catches or tackle ,  and players don t go through other players . 
many other options to keep little ones busy are available for this price . 
usually they screw around with the story mode . 
look elsewhere before you drop $ on these boots . 
it s ok ,  but we prefer perked coffee . amazon refunded the full price including shipping immediately on receipt of the return . 
did my research ,  looked at all the reviews ,  read the labels ,  bought this dog food . 
problem was in rubbing off i deleted some digits . 
and even then ,  i don t see how you could get one that won t leak . 
attempted to contact seller with no response after one week . 
the shipping was prompt and everything was well packaged . 
not even my one cat who will eat absolutely anything will eat these awful things .

but you wind up having to fight off the zombies .

i really love coconut water and was so disappointed to have waste my money . 
i took it home and hooked up the unit and got started recording my first movie . 
i used to buy a num_extend of envelopes from walgreens for about five bucks . 
when you need to join two pieces of num_extend  ethernet  cable together this is a must . 
it globs up very quickly and i have only used it twice and it needed to be thrown out . 
i have been using the crkt minimalist neck knives and love them . 
we have had great success with the little people sets previously . 
the fixed version is holding up so far . 
i even tried several pieces hoping it was something that would get better . 
i had this camera for a week and had to return it to the store . 
my daughter loves all the ones we have and they are educational and durable . 
but i wouldn t pay more than that for them . 
not the most comportable longline bra i have purchased . 
however ,  the description for this product clearly states it works with ipad . 
it is an insult to the pc version of soldier of fortune . 
streamzap acknowledged the problem on prior versions of the driver but it still exists to this day . 
these forks are not even as nice as the ones you get with your chinese takeout .

i prefer no sugar and organic ,  but organic no sugar ones were hard to find in my local stores . 
tried taking less for a longer period of time and it does nothing . 
apply a bit of petroleum jelly to the joints where they move . 
one drop broke this one and the backing fell off before that . 
i will be looking elsewhere for bluetooth headsets . gotta have one that stays connected . 
didn t last more than a few months in a calculator that i virtually never use . 
i figured when i bought it that i would be able to see the game i was playing . 
also note that flexogen is a patented hose . 
we then returned this doll at least num_extend weeks after the new year  january num_extend
it only took a few weeks for one bar to break . 
as soon as i opened the container i knew something was wrong . 
so i contacted amazon and they sent me a replacement . 
this stuff is bad ,  all the way around . 
they should atleast be able to provide a clearer sound . 
but both units had problems with the ball joint ,  which is about the most important component . 
the graphics on this game were very disapointing and the gameplay is not too great either . 
unfortunately ,  this battery pack seems to lose its charge fairly quickly . 
i m now conviced wii controller does not work with action games .

% sure if i hit a bump they ll come loose and turn off . 
but i wish i had saved my money and just bought a higher quality headphone set sooner . 
this was ,  in fairness ,  an  inexpensive  splitter and i should have known better . 
i say you get what you pay for . 
my previous nokia num_extend battery lasted nearly three years ,  and just got weak . 
they have a kong treat dispenser and some other generic one that they love . 
i was seriously afraid of getting type num_num diabetes and sending my kidneys into failure . 
thus ,  it is important to get them as many chew toys as possible . 
others with curly hair  mine is also long  know how important a conditioner is for maintaining their hair . 
i ,  as human ,  realize i m not the target audience for dog treats . 
no wonder it s num_num servings from only num_extend
don t like that this is not an adjustable sizing product . 
i m so jealous that others have had a great experience with this fragrance . 
i d give foxy curls zero stars if possible . 
disappointed ,  because the color in the picture would have matched my bike highlights perfectly .

it s all shooting ,  no fighting or dirving at all . 
i use it because i get prestas cheaper than schradder valves . 
one solution another reviewer and i hit upon is to squeeze the cuff during the beginning of inflation . 
getting the case off to change a battery is not fun ,  nor fast . 
with the case ,  putting any cover on is impossible ,  as is using a dock or station for it . 
they wouldn t even use it to sleep in . 
no sound unless you plug her into a computer . 
it was very unflattering and lumpy ,  i did not have a smooth silhouette . 
i had to redo my dining table the next day and just went back to pledge . 
there is a problem with the design of the tabs . 
i ordered a fram and it fit right in . 
i was planning to use it as webcam ,  but the picture quality is terrible . 
all recent reviews for the most part are negative because the product is from china not u . s . a . 
it just has a tiny hint of peanut butter . 
at least the num_num that i ordered from amazon did not . 
it s mostly made of plastic so don t abuse it but functionally ,  it works great . 
i think it was just really big and really floppy . 
i m assuming the seal cannot attach to the blue glass jar properly because of the cream . 
the story is a good one ,  but i found the game to not be so great . 
so small and hard that the only thing they are good for is to sit on a shelf . 
we are ,  of course ,  all different ,  and what works for someone may not work for all . 
this you could get at the dollar store . 
most of my friends love their kitchenaid stand mixers ,  so i bought one direct from kitchenaid .

it s a nice concept but doesn t work in practice . 
it is just as easy to make your own . 
emu oil has been suggested as the very best moisturizer . 
oh well ,  the search was wrong and because of that i was blamed for the problem . 
i bought it anyway because it is the cheapest router around with dual wan and load balancing . 
i ve tried and it resulted in either my death or a huge loss of energy . 
it s mostly just cut scenes of boring complex story . 
there are num_num fan settings on it and the lowest setting is ok as far as noise goes . 
the game is extremely uninspired and gets repetitive within num_num minutes . 
when i finished the game though i was horribly disappointed .

i was incredibly disappointed with the vectron wave from air hogs . 
the pictures basically appear to be a boxwave case but that is not what is being sent out . 
it was bland and the texture was too hard . 
i sent it back as soon as i opened the package . 
i ve had mine a little over a month and the footbed lining is already ripping . 
then the battery craps out and wont hold a charge anymore . 
this product is not a safe  nor does homak advertise it as one  . 
there are a lot of cases available for this phone ,  which is a good thing .

but all this is nothing to me because the pattern is cut  wrong  . 
i worked out with weights num_num times a week and did cardio three times a week while taking them .

they have been through thick and thin with me and i love them . 
it smelled like peanuts but it s nothing to over the top .

it was getting late and i had to buy something !  . 
luck and reckless speeding is your bonus over the ai . 
they sent me a pair of cheap nb num_extend
there are two main problems i find with it . 
the load times ?  no problem on my computer . 
this jacket was true to color but not to size . 
not what i was expecting ,  but it you know how to alter your brushes this is perfect . 
not even a coupon was offered ,  for all my time that i wasted . very poor customer service . 
the earbuds hold the battery that you recharge . 
in fact ,  after using it just a few times ,  i am doing just that . 
he s chaffed like he had a diaper rash . 
i am a homeschool mom and i had high hopes for this . 
 it was a good looking swimsuit though ,  just did not last at all  . 
i have very sensitive skin and unfortunately ,  the very bad habit of being a facial skincare products junkie . 
risky leaving phone there ,  and it sticks out annoyingly . enough for now . 
sky high promises aside if the taste is bad i won t drink it  beyond the sample i m reviewing  . 
this is too heavy and large for the chest . 
i had the choice of buying blade replacements for my ped egg or find a different callus remover . 
like paring my own clothes ,  or driving through a tree . 
i still had my headset that came with my num_extend and i compared them . 
how about playable ?  let me play for more than ten minutes without screaming in endless frustration . 
i m sending this one back to amazon and keeping the typhoo . 
after doing much research on this monitor i thought it would be a great buy . 
jeans have really changed ,  and these are a giant step backwards . 
i have never had this happen to me before in my life . 
this is confirmed by tests that others have done . 
it lasts like five minutes and then fades . 
it is like a teenager took these to a grinder . 
it would hold the num_extend pressure ,  but after a couple of hours ,  there s no air on the tube . 
washed it on gentle with very little detergent and with a jacket ,  pants ,  gloves and more . 
i gave these a try to replace my daily consumption of too much dew . 
i tried this product due to it s ratings ,  but was very disappointed . 
it simply boggles my mind that this is how mapsource works ,  now several years after it was first released . 
once filled i took it on a trip ,  and carefully sealed it in a ziplock bag . 
the other styles fit her and they were not wide sizes !  i am frustrated ,  to say the least . 
i immediately realized the battery is out of juice . 
i bought this pump with the intention of inflating a kiddie pool . 
i can t believe it !  i tried act dry mouth and hated the aftertaste . 
use the thai chi tea with powered sugarfree vanilla coffee creamer . 
if you re like my friend larry  we used to call him mr . 
we got two of these for our twins from a faimily member for christmas . 
the hair on these brushes were already falling off !  i was so upset !  i returned them the next day . 
my num_num month old puppy has jaws of steel so i wasn t expecting it to last terribly long . 
if you don t have wood window sills ,  don t buy this !  . 
we still have the num_num squirrels ,  but they aren t going to last long . 
i have been using splenda off and on since it became available to consumers . 
not worth the risk i took in buying it . 
however ,  this gizmo is completely unnecessary if you do not share your brushheads with other people . 
so if you go back for a second bowl ,  that s a pretty high caloric breakfast . 
it is not ,  i had to go through the hassle of returning it . 
a few months down the road ,  the posts are tarnishing . 
after owning num_num palms and one pocket pc   . 
although i do like this for reading ,  as aback support . 
there was absolutely no difference in reception with or without this attached . 
these treats easily slip out of the rubber ball thing they re suppose to stay in . 
if thq makes smackdown vs raw and day of reckoning . 
it was dry and had hardly any mascara in it when it arrived . 
i ve washed them a couple times hoping they ,  at least ,  become softer ,  but no such luck thus far . 
i frankly just burned my $ bucks with this game . 
so i tried just one num_extend piece each n still the same results . 
i was disappointed in the weight and size of this tool . 
they are just inferior razors that are wrongly designed . 
he was doing fairly well on the collar and with training . 
a very linear game that doesn t let you go off the beaten path ,  no exploration required . 
someof the welds have sharp points which can injure yourpet . 
very smooth feeling on her underarm and legs . 
it took me five calls to attempt to do this and still never got the account set up .

there are tasteless version of this you can get and put in a recovery shake . 
my dog destroyed this so fast i didn t even have time to stop him .

squeaker was out in about num_num minutes ,  from then on it was shredded to pieces . 
i always order several bottles at a time and got three which arrived today . 
i thought about giving them as a gift but decided to return instead . 
container was more and more viscous as i got closer and closer to the bottom of the big container . 
it does fit nice so i gave it num_num stars ,  but bad opening for my phone will be costly . 
it is a little too rich for my blood for a pan that is useless after num_num months . 
i bought same one for num_num gal its ok i rather tossed the food in . 
a product like this should be useable on it s own with the tv . 
the seeds are okay; there is nothing wrong about them . 
yet what i have now with the num_extend is worse . 
gave it to a friend who seemed to like it . 
it works ,  but i do not like that the head of the cord is so thick . 
there is a bright white pronounced border of plastic that was not color coated black . 
i have more than a hundred hours experience . 
i just can t wear their slippers any longer . 
i told him that the reviews say that these are good . 
the first unit i ordered ,  upon turning on ,  emitted a burnt plastic smell . 
it is an ideal drink for everyone whether taken hot or cold ,  in any occassion and season .   . 
the screen protector is thicker than average ,  but i think this may be a fatal flaw . 
while the tartar build up did not increase ,  it didn t decrease either . 
i feel like that money was wasted . i have made spritz cookies since childhood . 
i have refused to buy more bins since the cost for the box was crazy high . good luck . 
it is more filling to eat a chunk of real cheese . 
this sugar source is from corn syrup  first listed ingredient  ,  corn maltodextrin and sugar . 
the car mount came in the original motorola packaging ,  but was clearly opened by the oem store . 
this kitchen is ok ,  but there are much better kitchens out there . 
i think this company needs to research queen size . 
that part right there made this one of the worst games i ever played . 
just what i needed ,  another product with a transformer and power cords to keep up with . 
i am not new to digital camera so looks like i am not doing anything wrong . 
i believe mine was defective or they are not as well made as they used to be . 
i rebooted several times ,  all to no avail . 
the three pin adapter has num_num pins not num_num holes to match it . 
inside only holds num_num dolls and the compartments do not stay closed . 
this is not the same product ,  as the formula seems to have changed . 
not vegetables ,  not grains ,  not dairy .  .  . they require pure protein . 
this had to be the worst coffe drink i had ever had . 
i hate the short apple cord and hoped this would be a good solution . 
if you plan to use it once ,  this may be good enough . 
it should ve been thrown into the recycling bin immediately . 
i have performed the cleaning procedure several times . 
i was going for a wavy tousled look . 
volume works for about num_num notches ,  then won t go back down . 
supposedly ,  this is supposed to  grab  onto moisture ,  but i think it s bs . 
due to the improved defenses of supcom ,  that doesn t happen . 
if you don t know it already ,  cat s absolutely love to stretch . 
i highly recommend taking a look at the bell instead . 
it was more expensive but was very much worth it . 
it s so bad that i m starting to think samsung just makes junk . 
thirty five bucks !  really ?  this thing is built so poorly that it should really cost about five bucks . 
using this product ,  the slices stuck together ,  and didn t cook as evenly . 
it is a rich and engaging game with many different levels of play . 
just like in thriller where he played a ghoulish ,  inhuman beast ,  eerily foreshadowing the future . the gameplay itself is ludicrous . 
i ll be sticking to regular duplos  not education  from now on ,  despite the higher price . 
i don t think you can go wrong with this shaver . i ll leave updates later . 
i was able to use this unit with an antenna signal only . 
one of the biggest mistakes of my life was purchasing this travesty of computer programming . 
you have to occupy a usb port while using this num_extend
as a previous loyal burt s bees customer ,  i m out !  . 
i was very happy with it at first but the longer i used it the less effective it became . 
i have used many fragrance oils in my bathes ,  and never had this happen . 
normally i take advil before i play and the soreness i feel afterword is really minimized . 
the ones sold here are also made in mexico . 
i now have something else to buy batteries num_extend
i am afraid i am not going to hear it fall and will lose my phone . 
compared to nearly every other good headphone i ve used ,  i find the shure s treble response to be unsatisfactory . 
there s not a lot of leeway in these pieces to make anything different . 
but the menus ,  navigation and overall usefulness is virtually num_extend
it worked as far as suction to the screen and stability . 
i am a female ,  so that probably impacts my opinion a lot . 
so i ended up removing the pieces and using it as a regular litter box . 
putting rolled up towels under your head may be just as effective . 
since there was no data on it i hit the button to format it . 
the picture clearly shows gold connectors but they are not . 
the material doesn t even feel like something that should be used to make clothing . 
he already tore apart two of the bees . 
i would not recommend this product if you re looking for beach waves . 
in other words just imagine playing resident evil num_num but with more rooms and more puzzle solving . 
there are two issues with these stairs for smaller ,  older pets . 
the video shows that you can use the camera a side ,  but you need an adapter to do this . 
i have very mixed feelings on this dog toy . 
in this respect it is a departure from just lift and pour you typically do with the glass carafe . 
this is not a great product to buy . 
so ,  since the old one died ,  i decided to try the burr . 
i bought him this wishbone hoping it would give him some chewing action and last . 
these are the cheapest quality tools i ve ever had the displeasure of using . 
what i like is that the item got here on time ,  however its way tooo big for my phone . 
you can read my review on dap collar . 
i usually love everything i get from leg avenue ,  but these were very poor quality . 
these were just not that good . and in keeping with other reviewers with lower stars . 
while examining i ve found a lot of surface punctures . 
the issue i have with this is not that he is there but how he is presented . 
i had to do a lot of research and go through a lot of hoops . 
we returned it and our return has been denied . 
every time you get close to them ,  they hurt you . 
the twinnings green tea had little flavor or aroma . 
i washed my face twice a day with step one and followed it with step two each time . 
always said it would fit my num_num jeep wrangler sport unlimited . 
i spent about num_num minutes cooking over num_num days and num_num hours cleaning . 
if you loosen it ,  then the helmet doesn t seem to be on securely . looks too bulky on my head . 
i enjoyed it for about a week before i couldn t deal with it anymore . 
there are no tables !  only a corner shelf type table  worthless  . 
i guess its the small amount of spandex in these panties that ruin the feel . 
as the other reviewers quoted ,  this hat is not the one in the picture . 
i like the case ,  but it has a funny smell that gives me a headache . 
so back to shaking the bottle directly on my thinning areas . 
the suggested that a fountain might encourage more drinking . 
the courts look good but they don t have mascots ,  so it seems kinda dead . 
and ,  unlike most games ,  it was not a violent ,  mindless game . 
i an sure that some will say you get what you pay for and they are right . 
anco s clips don t look much like the ford clip i was replacing . 
i never got this item to clearly pick up on a station . 
a much better gluten free biscuit mix is the num_num num_num num_num southern glory brand . 
god is watching all of you money rapists . 
the strips are held between two clear layers of plastic  one layer has a sally hansen logo on it  . 
your vet has told you that cats and dogs are carnivores . 
the second you get past the menus and the gameplay starts everything just keeps getting worse and worse . 
our large breed pups do not seem to return to it . 
it s a very odd toy and i don t understand the reviews . 
they don t stand up to everyday wear and tear and the left speaker has a tendency to flake out . 
because this was frustrating rather than fun i give it a num_num star . 
sproing !  two opposite corners warped up nearly an inch out of plane . 
i bought this unit for a friend ,  and i could compare with others overdrives i already have . 
i put a towel under it and filled it til it was full but obviously ,  that didn t help either . 
poor tasting ,  mushy feel ,  not like what i thought they d be like and unlike other similar products . 
one sight had a red dot that was blurry . 
sony is trying to totally replicate my phone on my wrist . 
it does not stick on to the guitar very well . 
this radio should be better than it is for the price . 
sound wavers between the left and right channels . 
buy timesplitters or the pc unreal ,  save yourself from this turkey . 
these snap caps look great at first ,  but really scratch up with even the gentlest of use . 
so i m keeping the gel eartips  not this item  and throwing out these foam ones . 
i have never had glasses that break like these . 
i should have paid more attention to the size . 
sometimes it felt more like pain in my ear . 
this game is of very mediocre quality by to days standards . 
i have lived with chronic prostatitis regularly for the last six years . 
it does technically do its job ,  it is in fact a container . 
it was very disappointing since they are so cute . 
i normally love crayola products ,  but this is far below the quality i ve come to expect . 
if you want to take your chances with this ,  go ahead . 
if the manufacturer has little faith in their product ,  then neither do i . 
i will probably have to purchase another fluker s clamp lamp . 
finally ,  the story is why this game gets one star . 
i have to take the line housing apart at least num_num times every single time i trim . 
is that crap really necessary ?  i ll probably go back to hemp protein . 
it crashes at the start of the game . 
i bought for a glock num_num and really had to grind it in . 
she broke out a week and half later in same spot she wore this base . 
all of this means that i can not cut as efficiently as with my other knives . 
plus the days just seemed backwards to us . 
my wife doesn t like and she still keeps using the old one .  .  . the new model feels more  plasticky  . 
i ordered the cuisinart num_num slice maker to replace this one . 
this cream sinks after a while in the skin ,  but i have the same feeling of dry skin later . 
i still like the liquid version by another company a lot better . 
since those particular fish were fairly new ,  i wasn t positive that this product was the cause . 
i considered this as a cheaper alternative to the wrist widget . 
i tried lots of ways of mixing and applying ,  but nope ,  does not work . 
along with being bent ,  these screen protectors and made out of horrible yellow plastic . 
they graphics aren t what you would call a second generation . 
i went to the aso laceup level iii and it s much better . 
since it wasn t a cheap item i thought i could just store it upside down . 
the covers ,  bed and rim ,  can be washed but the stuffing cannot . 
it simply does not fit in with our meal types . 
could have fooled me !  it looks nothing like the movie . 
i don t know who the heck was in charge of controls for this game ,  but they should be fired . 
skip the wireless .  .  . next was the feature devoid software . 
if your some one who really needs a source of protein etc ,  you may like this product more . 
my dog had this torn open in less than num_num minutes . 
gabby loves the catit grass kit ,  so i got num_num other sets ,  this one total bomb . 
they cost less ,  are bigger ,  individually wrapped and produce a much smoother coffee . 
this was no help at all because it didn t work . 
what is disturbing is its ability to clearly focus . 
invading a system ,  and destroying and local fleets ,  and planetary defences is actually the easy part of invading . 
the positives :  my waffles baked up crispy on the outside and beautifully tender on the inside . 
i already sent in my review ,  but see it didn t get published . 
if there is more to unlock if you stick through the annoyances ,  i don t know . 
the measurement labels wore off within a year . 
my english bulldog chewed it off and what she ate made her puke . 
i will be looking for a different brand to replace this one . 
yeowww products appear to have declined in quality . 
i cannot tell you how disgusted i am with this purchase . 
i can t even draw pacman !  you have to be absoulute perfect with the drawing . 
then as you get addicted ,  you realize ,  for one thing ,  you have nooooo free time . 
i still have horrid oral thrush and am now trying olive leaf extract . 
it falls off in about num_num seconds once i start running . 
the replacement dimarzio is another example of one that was at the top of the list with cable comparisons . 
the crystarium that parallels with the num_extend system is pretty cool and getting experience was not frustrating . 
i commute via train and metro and there is nothing worse than people with huge backpacks on a metro . 
keep trying because this one isn;t cutting it . 
i was recently on vacation and used my phone all day for directions ,  bus schedules ,  etc . 
the material is thin ,  and the insulation is very cheap and again not what it used to be . 
i think you are better off with a regular cheese cutter and a plate . 
ultimately thats not a big complaint though ,  it looks passable . 
this stuff dries the hair out with its harsh chemicals . 
i rented this game and played as both an autobot and a decepticon for a mission or two . 
it s very unusual for me not to like a chi product but i wasn t pleased with this one . 
its ashame too ,  becausethis phone had it all . 
the originality of the game is the fact that the track forms itself into any sort of shape . 
if your really serious about skin care look into reviva labs or derma e . 
the nes versions of adventure island are alot better and more fun than this game . 
i was hopin for more mileage from the curcumin pills . 
if you eat yours one at a time like i do ,  i would recommend one of those . 
i was very dissapointment ,  actually i cant use this crocs because is so painfull and unconfortable . 
too squeamy for me .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . haribo always has a tasty product; but i can t get my eyes off the squigglies . 
adds height for longer range but the quality leaves a bit to be desired . 
she swallowed fabric that she pulled off the balls so i grabbed them up and tossed them . 
unfortunately it frankly did very little for my skin . 
this is not my first experience with terro ,  but it is certainly my least favorable . 
and much like several other reviewers on this board ,  i had graphics difficulty from minute one . 
this toy is expensive considering what it is . 
i sent it back because there s no mention of this in the description that it s not for occasional use . 
already ,  there are several mars that are particularly apparent while reading a book on the kindle app . 
i wanted them for eggs and hot cakes . 
overall i liked the look and feel of the shoe pretty well ,  and really wanted to love them . 
in fact they seem to be more reflective than the original ipod screen . 
this is another fine example of a junky toy . 
as a result ,  it takes two to three times longer to do yard work . 
so ,  i went back and ordered the next size up in waist . 
and i know my guns big time ,  red storm paid no attention to making the guns real like . 
the range on the new transmitter is less than a third of the older ones . 
this game has got to be the worst final fantasy ever . 
for some reason the head of the brush came loose ,  i continued using it until it came off completely . 
hmmmmm . nope ,  we re the largest agricultural producer in the world ,  and we host many of the best cooks as well . 
they obviously block the sweat from wherever they are ,  but wherever they are kind of changes . 
so ,  i asked for another person to talk to . 
my sister is allergic to dogs but not severely . 
it did protect the phone ,  but the case got loose on that top corner . 
when i replaced the original batteries with these batteries they last less than num_num days . 
num_extend st .  ,  torrance ca num_num with your grinder ,  the description of the problem   doesn t work   ,  your return address . 
you need to pair the new collar to the transmitter . 
the plastic piece that you connect the leash too is in a terrible spot . 
they were also wider than i thought they d be . 
once started it does a good job of opening the can . 
now i need to change it every week . 
i was jittery and felt weird for about num_num hours . 
reception was excellent ,  but in less than a year i had to purchase a replacement . 
this phone had problems from the start  as did the first one i bought  . 
when i used the drivers provided by belkin i would get constant dropouts at totally random times . 
i don t like the way it mixes up . 
if i tilt my head to the necessary side ,  i can make do . 
i live in a pretty urban area ,  but was able to find one not too far away . 
it was nice that it didn t change the shape of my breasts ,  but it was pretty uncomfortable . 
my dentist recommended spry ,  so i thought i d give it a chance . 
i can t even use this because the headphone jack hole isn t accessible with the case on . 
while not a bad idea in itself ,  the game fails to convey the meaning of war . 
i read other review ,  and decided to give it a try . 
for example ,  the case stitching is not high quality like the seller portrayed . 
it took a while for the dough to extrude and eveything stuck together . 
i paid $ for this and thought it would be a bit sturdier . 
other than the covers not fitting well ,  i have no complaints about the beds . 
this product sounded like a great idea to me . 
as for the texture ,  it was chewy and i felt like i had powder in my mouth . 
this lumbar was super hard and hurt my back . 
maybe mine was defective  i returned it ,  didn t want to waste time trying to get it checked out  . 
ever since i was about num_num years old ,  megaman has been my favorite videogame . 
the gel is really hard to work with and the brush sucks . 
it seemed to kind of burn in some places on my skin . 
years ago ,  i wore reeboks exclusively ,  in many different styles ,  and never had any problems with sizing . 
they offered to sell me a refurbished num_extend but no way was i going to buy another canon . 
however ,  loss in potency would be accelerated overtime . 
it is the only thing my boy asked for for christmas . 
my cats also didn t find the box to their liking . 
to wit ,  kill . switch veterans would likely rather be playing that game instead of this . 
the blade mechanism on this chopper is extremely difficult to remove or adjust . 
the earhook is so flimsy that it came apart in the first num_num minutes . 
if the grundig scans the fm band it only finds a grand total of num_num stations . 
and don t give me that  you can t compare handheld to the console  garbage . 
the mirror is plastic with a reflective sheet applied to it to act as a mirror . 
i felt that need for speed most wanted was a great game . 
this game has horrible story ,  graphics ,  and gameplay . 
these are so cheap i can t believe it . 
while doing nothing for num_num to num_num minutes was nice ,  the product did not do anything for my ailments . 
these titles will not disapoint as this title did . 
i would go with udi s ,  goodbye gluten ,  and food for life ,  instead . 
opening or closing the gate will result in a very loud screech from both struts . 
unfortunately ,  as i sipped it and it cooled down it started getting a  fishy  odor to it . 
threw her in the car and drove straight to walgreens for children s benedryl . 
another thing that bothers me is the introduction to the story . 
i was very happy at how quickly i received this product and in good condition . 
she has tritrichomonasand i was hoping maybe this would help . 
my dog has had one and now they re in the trash . 
i would not recommend this item if you need firmness . 
but the polaroid was not in stock ,  so i bought the toshiba . 
buy the bell citi or better yet the bell triton . 
maybe it s the herbs in the eboost ,  but it had a metallic ,  medicinal ,  bitter taste to it . 
however ,  when i try to run it all i get is an hourglass for a few seconds then nothing . 
how can i get my money back ?  i don t know if i should try another brand . 
hated to return them but these just won t fit me . 
i bought this to help with my vit . 
it chips after a day or num_extend and is hard to remove . it s not thick like gel . 
tried it ,  and wondered why my hands smelled . 
it automatically reboots it instead of turning it off completely . 
the other reviews about this salt is true . 
it s feb num_extend and i ordered this product on jan num_extend
it has a very slim appearance and a conveniently sized display screen . 
i don t mind paying more for quality ,  but it s like none exists anymore . 
they may cost more ,  but atleast you will get an accurate answer . 
this cat dancer toy might last long ,  but that s because it doesn t get much use . 
although i do not care for the smell ,  it has a nice consistency going on . 
this thing is now just a blue brick in the corner of my room . 
also very expensive so probably won t buy again unless it is less money next time . 
i saw the word  pomegranate  and jumped into action ,  bought this at sam s club . 
it will let water in if you put it in your pocket and go underwater . 
this toy is made up of num_num islands attached by a bridge . 
some enemies even get stuck in the wall . 
this remover burns so bad ,  and doesn t even really remove all the glue from the eyelashes . 
i think that s way excessive and using a  normal  amount doesn t work any better than regular shampoo . 
the acidophilus with pectin from the vitamin shope is cheaper and works better . 
it is polyester or some sort of synthetic material . 
and stay away from those bunny cookies !  !  yuck .   . 
it doesn t go around num_num like the other num_extend
in other words ,  press stop ,  then rewind then it seems to be more riskier . 
one of the bowls itself ,  was broken . the person tried to fix them . 
trust this review !  i would encourage anyone looking for a headset to try anything else . 
what directions ?  does it come with directions ?  it didn t even come in a box or bag . 
one star for stupid mistake and for my trouble . 
the heat melted the adhesive that was holding the velcro strap to the back of the picture holder . 
that is so lame , any number of singles titles on the line in a tag team match . 
but ,  like most of the other reviewers ,  we have a major problem with the hinge . 
i got one of these hoping to pick up some of the local dfw radio stations a little better . 
i don t know if i got an old box of these or if they re all like this . 
my daughter does enjoy trying to push them down in the tub . 
we also nailed in the gate sides to make it more secure ,  it didn t do too much . 
stability had very little effect overall and the bottle is perfectly within its shelf life . not impressed . 
my hair is super straight and i got this hoping it would be a good volumizer . 
there are many good options out there nowadays at this price range ,  dont waste your money here . 
it will work but you ll beat your hand up trying to bang tbe lever down . 
bought two pairs of these for hubby in size medium and they re huge . 
the consistency i got was thick ,  heavy ,  and never absorbed . 
so ,  based on my experience and the lack of support from the company ,  i m giving it a low mark . 
i don t think a size num_num w would even fit . 
in fact ,  i never even used the product before i returned it . 
well ,  once again i got sucked into all these awesomely glowing reviews ,  but it s just not working for me . 
it fell apart in five minutes ,  it s a complete piece of junk . 
when the rice is done simmering ,  add the sausage and two cans of well rinsed kidney beans . 
this product was not very expensive and appears that way . 
i washed it off and put on my normal cream . 
he was certain it was dirty ,  as it was filled with brown stuff and smelled bad . 
when i move it around ,  the cats turn to see where those babble noise comes from . 
however ,  this coating peels of rather quickly and makes it look cheap . 
stick with the kong wubba made of canvas much stronger . 
there are amazing details that the photo doesn t do justice to . 
the small tube just dries out the area i apply to . 
both my husband and i found ticks crawling toward our heads after sitting on the couch with the dog . 
it is also useful for pushing and pulling things around i suppose . 
unfortunately ,  these are stuck together and are only allowed to travel separately for the last three inches or so . 
it is so high above the road that your standing leg becomes exhausted from all the dipping and squatting . 
very difficult to transform and it broke very easily . 
so far i have num_num wii games that are pretty sorry . 
in fact ,  i would describe the overall flavor as bland ,  not tasty at all . 
this has worked very well for over a month now . 
this is definitely a toy for the over three set . 
you see ,  you must reach back to far to hit the thumb button . 
which is strange ,  since after about num_num years i have had one problem with amazon . 
but it seemed off ,  so i checked it with a boiling water bath . 
after a while ,  the pain subsided ,  of course . 
but ,  i m still in the air about how my hair looks . 
if you want to use the digital display more than once ,  you have to unplug and replug the unit . 
i have a killer all in wonder video card . 
when i received the product i was very disappointed in the quality of the case . 
i ve read the same happens with the z series as well . 
besides that ,  the fresnel distorts the words to a high degree . 
i have used alkaline duracell batteries for years and have always been satisfied with their quality . 
but ,  if you care about the sharpness of your photo ,  stay away . 
i feel better using cetaphil or even anthony logistics over this . 
these dolls look a bit scary and they don t bend their legs . 
i thought that i had closed the top tightly but maybe not tight enough . 
my parrotlets don t really care for this toy . 
i purchased this wrist brace because i have small hands and wrists . 
i don t see how it actually fits this many people . 
i thought that i had a bad unit so i returned the item for a new interact num_extend card . 
not sized correctly . i wear medium longs in army spec bdus and have several pairs in this size . 
then trying to close the case is just as painful . 
the fight action is interesting at first ,  but this too gets repetitive in a rather short time . 
the shoulder straps are made of cheap ,  thin padding  like the laptop sleeve  . 
jay robb claims sourced from grass fed cows not treated with rbgh on their internet site . 
i received the earrings in a plastic cover . 
i started using this in the beginning of the summer of num_extend and it worked just great . 
not sure what they were thinking making this . 
it did ,  however ,  tell me that i had a num_num second workout at num_extend
the first one you throw is always awesome . 
someone might know how to use this one ,  but not me . 
this extender worked great for two weeks ,  then it utterly failed . 
we searched the grass below and found num_num of them . 
i live in los angeles; it s above num_extend all day . 
i assembled it and put litter in it ,  and the next day decided to try it out . 
so here i am back on amazon getting oxbow timothy hay and i guess i will stick to that . 
ours had a cord for the phone and a cord to pull the toy with . 
maybe after the next firmware release it will get num_num stars . 
i tried pinching the banana to see if i could crush some of the nip ,  making it stronger . nothing . 
i loved the way it worked and it was the only thing that worked for my hair . 
amazon picture shows two rolling pins ,  leading us to believe that two would be in our order . 
i picked the correct case for my phone type and it just doesn t fit . 
an msr stowaway pot locks tightly and can be used to hold smaller items . 
she doesn t enjoy putting the balls on the track and could care less about the music and lights . 
if anything unusual happens ,  i will give an update . update :  april num_extend
i saw this product on qvc originally ,  was curious and read the reviews . 
when i saw the marble slicer i liked the look of it so i bought it . 
the fasteners are poorly made and come out when holding the carrier by the handle . 
there is nothing new to see here ,  move along . 
he loved to see the lights and the little puppy  dance  when he  sang  into the microphone . 
it was supposed to come in two days  i have amazon prime  and yet it never came it . 
you would be better off spending the money to get a custom one fitted by your dentist . 
these nuggets aren t bad but a big dog will go through this bag in a few nights . 
i was able to install the router by hand . 
way too huge to provide any firm support . 
if your hair is curly or dry ,  this is not the product for you . 
or ,  as an alternative ,  provide advice to the user on various aspects of the game  i . e . 
in addition ,  it only comes with a short usb cable designed to charge through your computer . 
connections would take a long time and would fail periodically . 
like all premium edge products , the dogs really like it . 
the one you have to start  o think now it s the mini  is so much better . 
i was looking forward to trying this because i had read some great stuff about it . 
the manual states it works with any mmc card . 
my dogs did eat this food at first ,  and slowly began to not like it . 
unless you treat your cosmetics like they re fragile children ,  i don t really recommend this product . 
i m back with the sephora brand of glass file . 
i like flowery smells on perfume but on the hair ,  it s kinda weird for me ,  specially this one . 
the colors are drab and don t blend with the rest of my son s pieces . 
btw ,  for mmx vets ,  there are no subtanks in this game . 
i went to inspect it and the little plastic piece that locks onto the wiper had cracked . 
the story is emotional ,  but the voice actors just couldn t add that to the game s characters . 
i sent both boxes back and i m disappointed . 
i bought it for my husband who walks every day and has a pace maker . 
probably because so much of the coffee gets wasted remaining in the container never making it to the basket . 
there were no good effects or bad effects . 
i slapped one on my painful hip at bedtime and did not smell any medicine or feel any tingling . 
so i ordered this bag .  .  . and it looks a little different than the pic . 
it will be going to the thrift store tomorrow . 
i ve bought dockers brand for years but something has changed . 
taste is ok but i am not reordering it . 
if you use this ,  just be aware that it is not good for sunscreen purposes . 
it s not a microphone but more of an echo chamber . 
i still get super itchy ,  red ,  inflamed skin . 
these head phones and uncomfortable and keep falling off every time i move . 
after trying it out ,  i wasn t satisfied with the results . 
i bit the bullet and graduated up to this one . 
i titled it ,  chose the opening theme ,  and stuff . 
the taste was horrible and it left my smoothies tasting very chalky i will never buy again !  . 
and you can have the chocolate by itself as well . 
you won t even be able to see your weapon . 
the marketing machine for zagg makes a big deal about the strength and scratch resistance of this product . 
call them for what you will not believe . 
i received one pouch of the eboost acai pomegranate daily booster from the vine program . 
the first two days it was oily and not as full looking . 
i purchased another that works fine and stays connected . 
dvd is an option ,  plus you can download your cd s to the internal hard drive . 
save your money and look for another mixer . 
then ,  sometime a few years later ,  nxt num_extend was introduced and to me ,  it was a huge step backwards . 
i typically prefer a rich ,  strong flavor but often bold coffees have too much acid . 
the first two times were fine with only a couple of stuck potatoes that eventually sliced . 
read the label . that being said ,  it s a nice oil . 
rafter and jack sizes on a hip roof  . 
i m sure one could hold it down ,  but that again defeats the num_extend
there is no  pilot light  led to show you that the mic is on or not . 
the stiffness is uncomfortable ,  but does lend itself to a nice ,  clean line ,  and good deposit of product . 
i contacted kensington  via their email support  and asked what the warranty period was . 
accidently got this stuff into my eyes and my eye looked like a monsters for a week . 
maybe it s because he s quite small num_extend months and num_extend lbs .   . 
kh has done nothing to improve their product in the replacement parts  not warranted  area . 
little ones will need help opening it though . 
fortunately for me ,  i touch my meter and it was very warm to the touch . 
they supply amazon ,  nationwide and slipped some old stock through thinking no one would notice . 
like others have said ,  these just don t last . 
sometimes a lot comes out and sometimes barely anything . 
we bought this toy for our two and three year old . 
at num_num per cleaning ,  i only have num_num more cleanings to go . 
once the valve was lost ,  water and other things gets inside . 
the holes cut right but i just don t like it . 
so ,  possibly ,  i may have missed some treasured gameplaying nuggets . 
most of the pieces are just not very memorable ,  and very few of them stand out . 
not as good as anniversary in my opinion ,  but still very good . 
it s larger than i thought it would be but it s not huge . 
my son was unsure what it was when he saw it . 
today i went to turn it on and the light flashed and then it shut off . 
everything works fine until one point where the map tells me to go to a checkpoint . 
even more excusably ,  there s not way to pause the cutscenes . 
i bought the small jar and finished it all . 
suddenly ,  an intergalatic army of invaders storm the place looking for fayt and his father ,  a famous scientist . 
no matter my location ,  the connection drops  glitches  frequently ,  and drops vpn connections . 
when patches come out ,  i will try again . 
i have never encountered a game with so many bugs . 
that come with skin exposure to the sun . 
no way to stop it spinning except let it run itself to the end of that winding . 
they could have been put to much better use . 
couldn t get any size to fit me properly . 
ditto . i d rent this one first ,  to see if you get drawn in ,  before you buy it . 
i thought i d try these for a few dollars . 
the puzzles are very small so the higher numbers like num_num are just a pain . 
and it said to increase num_num capsules a night until you have three or more bowel movements a day . 
if it did get played with ,  i know it would last . 
but i think probe thermometer s are far from perfect . 
hope you have better luck than i did . 
we grind our coffeebeans about weekly; we re too busy to grind them per brewing . 
addictive !  num_extend well ,  because it s small ,  it s easy to carry around . 
i don t know why the conair is causing it . 
the conditioner smells great as does the rest of the line . 
this seemed rather easy to me until the flag poles started to move ,  then it got a little frustrating . 
i wasn t able to use this product right away . 
this  stylus pen  is not going to work out well for use on my itouch . 
my hamsters escaped countless times ,  found myself having to duct tape parts of the cage they were escaping from . 
this thing sounds like crap with anything distortion . 
with the same cables ,  same computers ,  and same modem ,  i placed the gigafast router into my network and instantly . 
i was given two male parts ,  not a male and a female . 
i then bought the num_num version and its been working great for a long time . 
we have a groundhog that lives under our deck . 
i brought it back the very next day . 
after trying this on ,  i m wondering what bra everyone else got that posted a review . 
if you want to compare it to other fps ,  medal of honor blows it away in every way . 
this product did not help my dog stop pulling on the leash . 
so i m only giving it num_num stars for now and i m going to come back and rate again . 
this product does not work for my num_num lb golden retriever . 
now i m going to trash this  thing  and see what linksys has for print servers . 
it broke within a few months and i had to purchase another one . 
i decided to try connecting the hose directly to the faucet and removed it from the connector . 
the previous title ,  sonic advance ,  has a far better idea on what made sonic great . 
this game collection was an excellent idea that seems to have been slapped together and packaged overnight . 
they usually scarf up the gravy but barely touch this . 
i gave one to my mother and kept one for myself . 
maybe i wasn t doing it right ,  but i followed directions . i don t recommend . 
if you want a prop ,  this is ok . 
thank goodness there s a return policy at babbages . don t buy this one . 
i do not like the seam ,  you can clearly see it through many of my shirts . 
many appear to have shoddy workmanship in that they leak air . 
if nothing ,  writing is rewriting .   that philosophy really sums up nfl head coach . 
the lid did not fit right so it just leaked all over the place . 
when we received the package only had a fork and spoon no knife . will not be ordering another set . 
i am still searching for a charger that will charge my old motorola num_extend krzr . 
i got him super cheap so it would cost more to return ship him than i paid . 
the main objective of a bluetooth headset is to eliminate the  clutter  that comes out of wires . 
for around $ i expect shoes to have a well built ,  comfortable sole . 
my num_num year old pit tore it to pieces in less than num_num minutes . 
eventually ,  after about a month of this ,  those keys stopped responding at all . 
grinds hit the grinder and gravity pulls them through with ease . 
after a couple of months with this headset i have to give it a bad review . 
couldn t get hair to stay in this large donut . 
i think it comes down to poor design . 
concept was great but tad heavy in the ears ,  would not stay on . 
also ,  at num_num calories ,  i m not sure how this is going to make me  thinkthin  . 
this is my view of this product and i only have the above product link to compare it to . 
i found them to be smaller than others i ve tried ,  and therefore ,  didn t like them . 
just seems not sturdy enough for my phone . 
do all coffee grinders work this way ?  i don t know ,  this is my first one . 
i spent a lot of time honing the blade against a sharpening stone . 
there is little to inspire a kid to play and pretend .  . the construction is sturdy . 
at that point ,  you can determine if the cost of repairing the camera is of value to you . 
regardless ,  it will still be far superior to this rubbish . 
don t waste your money on these quick releases . 
the sales associate made it sound as the palm would install the needed components on my computer . 
if anyone of you think i made a mistake in someway please let me know . 
not something i could see myself purchasing again . 
the item arrived the estimated day but that is why i rated this two stars . 
it was fine though h h h h h h hhhhhhhhh h h h h h h h . 
now that i don t like it anymore ,  i find it quite unusual how people worship it . 
i have biracial girls with long curly hair and this stuff didn t even work on my baby s short hair . 
i bought this in black so can t report on the other colors . 
it d difficult to explain but it s very thin ,  very lightweight . 
does not fit well on a large adult male head . 
these are just what i was looking for ,  just not the flavor i liked . 
i m still looking for a reliable vendor for the num_num mg strength ginseng ,  which tastes quite palatable . 
if thats what you ll carry ,  then you might like it . 
i was in despair and tried not to give up on it . 
no lights ,  no itunes ,  no phone vibrating ,  nothing . 
i use moisturizer along with it ,  and bought a primer but have not been able to use it yet . 
when these speakers don t receive a signal for a while ,  they shut themselves off . 
i won t buy another unless there is some kind of warranty . 
the bass is too low if you re not able to adjust it with an equalizer . 
it sounds like there is additional fuzz in the treble . 
why is this ?  i have no earthly idea . 
that s when i knew there had to be something i could do about it . 
upon all the led light bulbs i ve been buying ,  this proves to be the most reliable . 
camera was well taken care of never dropped or abused . 
find a demonstration model in a computer store and try typing on it . 
i am currently searching for a new presto !  . 
i really like this case ,  but it scratches easily . 
its inside are plastic made and easy to fall off . 
as a holder only it is ok ,  but you don t have to spend $ for that . 
we loved it till the squirrel noticed it and started jumping on it trying to get to the food . 
this was only a num_extend turkey and it took num_num cleanings . 
my hair is growing really fast and i don t have nearly as much falling out . 
stations that i can get with a much smaller radio come in with a lot of static . 
good price if i had fit the wires i needed to be covered . 
when are they going to quit saying those same stupid things that they ve been saying for years . 
i purchased this watch to help me train for a race . 
however ,  this supp made my anxiety go through the roof !  i couldn t stop sweating turning red and freaking out . 
but .  .  . i gave it another try the next morning ,  horrible result . 
the pin goes all the way in not what i expected . 
it finally gave up the ghost ,  so this is what i got . 
helps when my plantar flares up to keep my foot immobile but no way on wearing all night . 
i bought this thermometer to replace a num_num year old taylor thermometer which has given excellent service . 
however ,  i m gonna give this to a couple with dainty cats . 
no more cradle or wires to haul around  or loose  . 
num_num a month ?  so nope gotta find an alternative . 
unfortunately ,  for me they are not true to size . 
i specifically searched for the cable to at least be num_extend
anarchy online invaded my life for several months ,  unfortunately . 
the legs have fallen out of their slots on more then one occasion . 
hope it works !  i ll be back if it doesn t . i m back . 
it was also not a simple chore to swap them out . 
you can t put much water in and once it s in ,  it easily spills . 
he put num_num of the wheels on and snapped the base together and has not touched it since . 
it is into one timed mission ,  to start another . 
i will never buy from this company again . 
i have a large dog and so actual whole pig ears would be better for her . 
i brush their teeth every other day and was hoping this will also help in reducing tartar build up . 
it has a spicy midly sweet scent to it . 
you get what you pay for in this case !  !  . 
i like coffee but this espresso coffee drink was too strong for me . 
was bought so that it didn t take up a pci slot . 
when i got these ,  to my surprise ,  the treats looked like something to feed a mouse . 
the inside is dense but not really grainy but just rather tasteless . 
that works better than trying to make the wireless on this actually work . 
in fact if it had a gurantee i would request one . 
twix especially looking more sick than ever . there s just no way possible i could recommend this product . 
the only reason i gave two stars was because they were packed well and they look good . 
than the unit stopped fully recharging and goes slow . 
the device was used ,  which i know is already stated . 
also ,  for it to work well you need to be in an extremely small room . 
we make coffee every morning and always use whole bean . 
this item arrived and it was not past it s due date . 
it was rather strong ,  which i don t mind . 
took a couple of attempts to get him comfortable with the noise but once we did he was ok . 
it propped my phone up but i could not use certain screen protectors with it . 
the texture of this licorice it gritty rather than chewy . 
sure there were positive reviews ,  but all the negative reviews were too important to simply ignore . 
the last point is that the buttons are uncomfortably hard to press . 
i m not sure how this has so many good reviews . 
i will ask amazon to send me a replacement ,  as it must have been defective . 
the reason is that the top lever is too cheaply made and it flexes . 
i guess large drives are not ready for prime time especially for large file work . 
i jog every day and i always wear sunblock . 
pay the extra money if you need a good jogger and get the nv . 
this means that this charger will charge those devices slower but that is perfectly fine by me . 
one of the cows  legs broke the very first shot i took with it . 
my son loves this toy gun ,  having asked for it above all the other nerf guns . 
it s easy to buy replacement brush heads ,  and that is a big plus . 
it just sprays everywhere and makes a mess . 
i prefer my cheaper cover girl eyeliners from my local drugstore . 
the chicken came out beautifully cooked ,  perfectly browned . 
save your money and buy some songs from itunes . 
they said this router doesnt work with my wireless adapter and i needed to buy a netgear adapter  wtf ?  !   . 
the ipod snaps in relatively easily but the edges hug too close and tightly to the screen . 
one usually has to mitigate the results or average the ratings a bit though . 
it looks cakey and thick on your face . 
i normally wear a size num_num but these were too tiny . 
i spent num_num hours to get the card working . 
on first use we didn t get any flow ,  but i figured the filter needed to be primed . 
however ,  after about a month of use the cutting blade seemed to be sort of dull . 
it s greasy but works great and doesn t have all the unnecessary chemicals . 
while the flavor is better ,  unfortunately the meat is of such poor quality that it s difficult to recommend . 
could be a fluke ,  but my unit was defective straight out of the box . 
go figure ? cannot truly recommend this ,  to bad the company does not offer the little sample packets . 
it s slim andquality  poor  :  the plastic over ear hook broke within a month of owning this headset . 
like another reviewer mentioned they almost sheer when held up to the light . 
i ve filed a claim with the seller and will update my review when they ve had a chance to respond . 
i haven t tried any of the silver colored ones yet ,  but i d expect the same outcome . don t waste your money . 
but it works the same as all the other lotions i ve used . 
i have an avid chewer ,  a terrier ,  so much so that i call him the toy destroyer . 
i prefer french grey salt for taste and since it is a fine grain it can be  applied  evenly . 
i got this for using purigen ,  a renewable filter media . 
i needed a camera quick because i had a trip to san francisco and denver coming up . 
i would have only given this one star ,  but it is ok for doing abs work . 
i ordered this network router for my home office . 
you are better off picking your own quality fabrics and supplies for less money than this kit . 
i would skip these and get magformers instead . 
bought num_num and both of them ended up with broken ends . 
i m switching back to neutrogena rapid tone repair . 
this particular lame is just not sharp enough . 
any way ,  the graphics are poor for the gcn . 
two months later and i still do not have a working unit . 
when questioned ,  he stated that maca s lead content is lower than this . 
the one notch broke off with the first good turn . 
i donated the remainder of the case to the local food bank . 
i stopped using it after a few weeks . 
i am not going to keep it ,  so i am not going to check it out . 
i think the secret is that she can t get it all in her mouth at once . 
yes ,  it can sometimes be a pain in the ass to open and close this lock with the key . 
in looking at comments on the ag website ,  i found numerous complaints about poor success rates . 
it s made durable enough ,  but could have been better . 
the shipping was good , it was vacum pick , and arrived early . 
in between i try to dry it as often as i can . 
audio randomly sounds like a tape slowing down and speeding up . 
he wanted to know why i had put bacon bits  or the taste of them  into his tea . 
it tastes like sugar and water with some nasty extra flavoring . 
for some reason ,  i expected that dockers would sell a better belt . 
after a couple of weeks of use ,  the rubber portion starts to separate from the plastic . 
the nonstick surface is crap . i ve owned this pan less than three months . 
this lasted two uses for me ,  and then the red brush part detached . 
i bought the num_num straight leg jean three years ago from tractor supply company in size num_extend
i needed the help of a pro to clear those out . 
worse ,  the paint has a bad tendency to peel when wet and chip when dry . 
if you can do one you can do both here . 
this product doesn t make any sense to me . 
yes ,  even when you don t use a lot of product . 
like i said ,  this is a thoughtless and annoying design . 
what a waste of good money !  cost me an equivalence of us $  !  !  !  . 
worst ,  their manager used to call me after midnight . 
i wish there were better alternatives ,  but for price this is it . 
when i checked the order it was listed as num_extend again . 
the convection function still works ,  it s just the microwabe section that s failed . 
i have obviously only used it in the car going and coming from work . 
i have purchased this toy along with the beaver ,  raccoon and ladybug of the same brand . 
the pointer doesn t move smooth like regular mouse . 
i own several pairs of these jeans ,  same size ,  same everything . 
the battery failed to charge after only two years . 
in fact ,  i mistook it for garbage at first and almost threw it away . 
but knowing that i may have to pay another $ to return them if they are too big . 
the lodge camp dutch oven lid lifter is very lightweight . 
when the thermostat goes off the fan just circulates cold air . 
and ,  to make matters worse ,  the manufacturer adds fructose sugar to the recipe ,  which adds an inappropriate sweet note . 
too bad because i love the slipper otherwise . 
i get tired of always fighting goblins ,  zombies ,  and aliens . 
as a product it was a great idea for that purpose . 
without the battery cover the batteries fell out at the slightest bump . 
i do not plan to buy this sauce in the future . 
i bought this so i could have an internet connection with both my xbox num_num and my computer . 
it was listed starting they re were only num_num left in stock and out was priced at $
next time i ll spend the extra money and hopefully have better luck . 
just enough so it appears that they care . 
during the longest period of connectivity was my heaviest use as well . 
i end up sending it back for a refund . 
the c . a . r . b spout is difficult to use and nearly worthless . 
this may be good for you but it taste awful to me !  won t be buying this again . 
it would work fine on the floor where the router was . 
very fair !  !  !  did they even test this ?  ?  ?  wrestlemania num_num had a better career mode !  enuff num_extend many animations . 
also i ran across a couple of bugs . 
to get hot lather ,  which is nice ,  you first have to get the device installed on top the can . 
invicta should be ashamed to put their name on such a tool . 
the build quality on the num_extend rail case is night and day better than this flimsy phonesuite brand . 
i received a bottle as a vine sample but i would not spend my own money to purchase one . 
there were three screen protectors and they all had the same problem . 
this battery is for the atrix ,  and will not work properly with a droid x or num_extend
you are paying for packaging ,  and little else that cannot be purchased elsewhere for much ,  much cheaper . 
cher ps the htc droid incredible is totally awesome . 
a definite huge step up from whatever lousy free  buds you may have gotten with your player . 
i had other pens that work a lot better than these ones . yet always keep it . 
there are no camera angle changes ,  and no num_num degree control . 
i thought comfortable around eye area would be good but actually really cheap foam . 
and stoneware will also chip ,  and break if dropped ,  etc . 
i own several upscale table radios from different manufacturers but i had wanted a tivoli for a long time . 
i can t speak about the function of the oil because i sprayed it only once . 
the next time i popped two batches using one powercup concentrator . 
lowfat milk makes it taste flat ,  empty ,  like something important is missing . 
your sausage ends up looking like hot dog or bologna meat . 
twice i got extremely awful taste  very sour and astringent  . 
i thought maybe the outlet had failed and tried a different one but the blender still didn t work . 
we have not ,  however ,  had any problems with durability . 
the music is cheaper and the story is stupid . 
i have another speedloader case bought from midwayusa and the quality difference was vast but the price was not . 
there are way too many places for pet hair to collect where it is hard to remove . 
i will post a photo of the damage tonight . 
where the problem was immediately obvious ,  a wire was not soldered to the fingernail sized circuit board . 
you will do better buying something much cheaper than buying this current formulation . 
this has to be the worst wwf wrestling game i have ever played . 
this is the worst case i have ever seen . 
i bought this in a store because i was low in supply at home . 
so inevitably the other parts of my lips become increasingly red . 
unfortunately ,  after a few hours of being totally entranced by the smell ,  both my cats ignored it . 
has a beautiful rumble and would make a great addition to a home theater . 
you shouldn t have to play a game num_num times to get through it . 
i recommend going with the fox labs products . 
it landed on gravel and shattered into num_extend of shards . 
but i m seriously considering switching back to the disposable ones . 
it s completely clear ,  but the color is a saturated pink . 
plus ,  it is num_num times more economical  cheaper  ,  now i figured out . 
so i know that it wasn t destroyed by a careless third party . 
the box doesn t appear to be labeled for direct shipping . 
last summer amazon carried another organic brand that was superior to this one . 
we gave him this and after initial uncertainty ,  this became his favorite . 
this is the worse num_extend game i ve ever played . 
weapon system was a strong point in the game ,  finding items and creating a weapon out of them . 
the recess for the index finger rubs against the back of the finger when you are cutting . 
the baby tires of it and rolls away from it after about three minutes . 
i believe the price is usually around $
that s how we judged video games back then . 
i also liked its compact design for use in travel . 
otterbox used to be one of the best guess i m going back to seidio . 
it turns out the fruit thief is not the rabbit after all . 
aluminum from a soda can would work ,  too . 
i was excited about this toy since i had one when i was little . 
it does not have a chili consistency and the various ingredients are not blended well . 
woohoo !  the smell is not offensive to human noses . 
 . after several weeks ,  it starts leaking and some of the  functions  do not work like when it was new . 
i really don t like the way it s made but otherwise it s cute but just not on me . 
starting with an odd series on krypton ,  which take a little getting used to ,  and can be difficult . 
don t know what i was expecting from these . 
and that tail whips around way too fast . 
farewell ,  old salt .  .  . b  it sucks making tapes ,  however . 
the one stencil that actually matches my eyebrow shape is way too thick . 
this is apparently a cheap counterfeit ,  made to look like the real blackberry battery . 
this color is not what it looks like in person compared to the picture online . 
leaning back ,  you can completely flatten it against the chair . 
this has a very strong fragrance ,  one that i don t particularly care for . 
i pictured tiny tapas sized molds and got large molds that don t really do the shapes justice . 
maxell ,  your headphones are bad and you should feel bad . the sound is low . 
i have put it in bed with him and he never pressed the button by mistake . 
it s entertaining for a little bit watching the zombies fall apart at the hands or blades  of ash s chainsaw . 
it looks formidable ,  has a nice ,  industrial looking finish ,  and grinds well ,  uniformly ,  and quietly . 
the little wheels slip so easily ,  even for an adult . 
so oily and does not go away when i rinse it . do not like it . sd s s sfa e efa . 
there s been no abuse or damage ,  so there s no reason for the failure . 
but ,  the blender leaves more chunks of uncut material than should be the case for one of this price . 
and this was a very reasonably priced bra that fit . 
one of the plastic tabs broke on the very first use . 
it s a thick white powder ,  not translucent like mineral veil is supposed to be . 
for me this product was a waste of money . 
once paired with an iphone num_extend it will pipe all audio to the headset . 
maybe i am not using these like i have to . 
the material is just not conducive for play for more than a minute . 
num_num hours later i was throwing it up . 
the edges were poorly cut ,  the seam was poorly molded . 
i bought it from amazon . com when it was on sale . 
it is also expensive for such a small bar . 
i like the peppermint in the neti stik better . 
the unit itself is attractive ,  and i liked it over all ,  it worked very well . 
update :  i stopped using this product after ring out that it is not num_extend as other opi polished . 
immediately ran out and bought another set but later found out they had changed the design slightly . 
we do not have a extra thick curtain rod . 
they ve destroyed projects that i ve saved on them . 
there is only a hint of that starbucks goodness imho . 
i would prefer having one that looks like the one illustrated . 
the only reason it doesn t have num_extend to num_num stars overall is because people are ,  well ,  different . 
already tonight i ve needed to unplug it twice to reset it . 
the glue didn t hold so the clamping base separated from the stem that allows the meter to swivel . 
i bought one of these about num_num years ago . 
another $ coaster . when i start the game ,  a window pops up and it says ,   the game cannot start . 
i suppose they are better than nothing but i m really not happy with them . 
i bought this because it can be used on any stove to clean and polish it . 
i have had num_num or so invicta s over the years and have had to send some back for service . 
now the drill will not work at all; a piece has broken inside where you stick the bit in . 
i decided to box it back up and pay a couple hundred bucks more for quality . 
this game was said to have been much more than it is . 
after spending months reviewing machines i settled on this one and am disappointed . 
i ended up finding num_num num_extend chips in the glass and i noticed it fogging on the inside . 
you can almost cut yourself by simply handling them by their edges . 
i mean ,  i felt like i was playing final fight or double dragon again . 
you wonder exactly what this game is about after all . 
i am very ,  very disappointed with this product . july ,  num_extend
i was looking for a rich dark red as shown . 
the size num_num were too small and the size num_num were too large . 
to sum it all up ,  it s a good game idea ,  wrapped in technically flawed garbage . 
the digital display and time still work fine but the mechanical hands start to fail . 
i m returning the trimmer; i m assuming amazon just throws these away when returned  i hope  . 
my biggest gripe with this remote is it s range . 
at first you think it s going to be a challenge . 
these are small pieces of plastic that you can do some cutting on . 
hard to stay that intensely focused for that length of time . 
after listening for several days ,  i decided to return it . 
the depth issue also makes me bump my hand on the cutting board when i am holding the knife . 
there is also a very strong flavor of cinnamon . 
previously ,  joby forced you to buy another tripod to use with other devices . 
but on examination ,  one sees it is made of no . 
the two halves unscrew ,  and you put kibble in it . 
they are very narrow and don t fit the average num_extend
you get what you pay for so i should not complain too much . 
it should be stated somewhere that these are little girl earrings . 
but the cost to produce this must be about num_num cents ,  if that . 
third ,  the remote doesn t work across the room unless you hold your mouth and wrist just right . 
apparently that was a misguided assumption on my part . 
this is the worst kitchen appliance i ve ever owned . 
i should have known that anything with atari , looks like atari . 
i tried it a few times and each day i d come home and my skin would hurt beneath it . 
we returned ours and luckily got a full refund from the store we purchased it from . 
for the last num_num years my husband i have not been preventing pregnancy ,  but not trying either . 
shame on ea and dice for making a game so hard to register and install . 
looks like the generic chinese products won t work for an expert either .   .  .  .  only $ but i m returning . 
it wasn t long ,  however ,  before we heard our dog choking . 
i didn t use it consistently but i feel a regular cleanser works way better than this pricy cleanser . 
so ,  this talking that i said you do ,  well ,  it s pretty much reading actually . 
oh you can manage to get it on alone ,  but it will be all loose and hanging and ineffective . 
my son is almost num_num months old ,  and has absolutely no interest in this toy . 
talk your child into some other polly pocket item than this one . 
i turned it off ,  washed it off ,  and then it never worked correctly again . 
edit :  so i exchanged it but unfortunately ,  my dog doesnt like it at all . 
maybe i got an old one ?  ?  anyway ,  won t bother to buy this again . 
both of the canisters were opened at the same time and stored in the same cabinet . 
california based companies typically have my packages delivered to me within two days . 
this product ,  like many others ,  may work for some ,  but not all . 
it is thick ,  so only a little bit is needed ,  but it isn t fully absorbed by my skin . 
the best are still num_extend and il num_num sturmovic also il num_num ace expansion pack . 
i gave this game num_num stars because of good graphics and good entrances that s it . 
i really like the taste of these chocolates ,  but they almost certainly use gmo ingredients . 
this is one of the worst shooters i have played in a long time . 
it doesn t have radio or recording function ,  while many other players have integrated these functions . 
purchased this for my num_num year old son . 
it seems to work ok but sometimes you want a product for more than just functionality . 
unfortunately i have num_num different cup sizes and none of them was fitting below like the picture . 
i do not know what i do not understand about buying pants but these fit so weird . 
i have tried whole foods num_num mayo and this spectrum canola mayo . 
i found it to be very messy and not very effective . 
i don t wear these while sparring or free rolling ,  but for practice it works well . 
hence it got num_num starswe prefer to poach eggs and that is the big disappointment with this unit . 
thank god i had real ice cream in my freezer . 
i was disappointed :  the lexar card was even slower than the delkin card . 
it said it would fit the etrex num_num but it didn t . 
the inside of this bottle emits very strong plastic smell ,  which to me indicates a lot of leaching . 
after i forced myself to finish most of it ,  i suffered from really bad heartburn afterwards . 
sorry ,  i am very disappointed and annoyed ,  with clif bar and with amazon . com . 
it has none of the issues listed above and will certainly last a life time . 
this was a waste of money and time and effort to assemble this puzzle . 
however ,  the night cream is definitely worth it . 
i never had any problem with something fitting until now . 
i was really hoping that this monocular would be good enough for birdwstching . 
i had the otterbox for num_num months for my evo shift . 
why would they change the ingredients after all these years ?  so disappointing . 
the music also fits the mood just right . 
i unrolled the leaves and sprayed the spray directly on the worms . 
this binder is so stiff and uncomfortable ,  i can really only wear it for a few hours . 
the bear is too stiff and sheds like crazy . 
way too sweet for something that s supposed to be  healthy .  maybe little kids would like it as a treat . 
it wound up being welded to the oven bottom ,  a complete piece of garbage ,  don t bother . 
because of it s weight it is not a light push and my puppy lost interest in it fast . 
the label says its blackest black but its brown !  . 
oh yeah ,  and i forgot . loading .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . loadingloadingloadingloadingstill loading .  .  . you get my point . 
i had an old black pair of koss headphones that i loved . 
i d rather do something more immediately gratifying or worthwhile ,  like playing an actually fun game ,  or reading . 
it s too bad that aspartame is what makes this drink so deliciously sweet . 
there must be others out there that are better quality than this one ,  go find them . 
not a combination you want to have when the safety of your wrists is at stake . 
it didn t work in either phone said invalid battery . 
i can use it when i m using perfume elsewhere ,  so there s no clash . 
usable speed brings my rating down to num_num stars  . 
yea right ! senate missions consist of blockading one port after another very exhilirating . 
loved twizzlers and was so sad to find out i couldn t eat them anymore . 
too bad ,  cause i was pretty excited about this . 
if you are an audiophile or have a good ear for music ,  then don t buy this . 
some of the easiest mixing powder formula i ve tried ,  and we ve tried a lot . 
now ,  it takes two or three good headbutts to finally kill somebody . 
less num_num hours later ,  limp hair that wouldn t hold a curl . 
i would havi would like to say i am a regular eater of protein bars . 
i used it to glaze some chicken ,  and tasted it on a teaspoon as well . 
if it works for you ,  it works great . 
in anticipation of this product being amazing ,  i was excited to install it at first . 
so i ordered a quantity of num_extend thinking i d receive a total of num_num for my son s birthday party . 
who has room for all of them anyway . 
cord is too short and it does not heat up fast and does not get very hot . 
the first two systems were competitively priced to compete . 
i do not like that slick feel to my hair from products . 
need an engineering degree to operate the mechanism . 
they looked great with jeans and even my dress pants for work and a casual sweater . 
it turned out to be a big mistake . 
used up almost the whole thing ,  did not see any lightening . 
speed num_num sounds like one of those white box fans on high . 
anyway ,  the soundtrack is really european ,  really techno ,  and really ,  really bad . 
need to get a scratching post that is sturdy for a big cat . 
the bottom bowl is pretty thin ,  which led to the handle breaking . 
the whole game is silly and feels very childish . 
i have purchased num_num of these from amazon ,  neither worked . 
i played through this disaster and my heart was shattered into a million tiny pieces . 
i don t believe that wii controls generally work well for flying games and this one is no exception . 
my title says it all . agree with most other reviews . 
i don t know why they designed it this way . 
this is my num_extend bottle of keys solar rx . 
they cannot be removed without tearing so you cannot reapply them to make them straight . 
container stored in the refrigerator the whole time . 
if i have it clipped on my pocket ,  the eargel faces out and unavoidably rotates to its removal position . 
the game is totally linear  at least as far as i played which admittedly wasn t far  . 
should be made of a more  little tikes  type plastic . 
i have a basset hound that cries and bays like crazy when i leave on my bicycle . 
these fog up on my face all the time . 
each week ,  i have to scour the rust off with steel wool . 
i have thin hair that doesn t usually tangle all that much . 
i read the other reviews and figured they must be a bunch of fat guys complaining about fit . 
i was hoping to like this ,  at least a little bit . 
i also own a num_num x num_num tent made by kelty which is also and excellent tent . 
i could sit in it and i m num_extend concept and low price however the poles are worthless . 
but ,  i can t take salt out of a prepared food whereas others can always add salt . 
the blade can fly from side to side ,  and the syma cannot . 
i rely on this and if ppl were not truthful ,  it totally defeats the purpose . 
it has a very strong light penetration and lasts long . 
when i reviewed all of the comments i notice that most wrote how quiet this pump is . 
por has to be the most disappointing crpg release ever . 
i cut mine with a scissors ,  which resulted in small pieces of the flammable material all over my counter . 
the rubber lock cover keeps out dirt and water . 
this fixed that issue . second ,  the sound was not great . 
i used it and seems to do the trick on some magazine base plate work i used it for . 
we were so excited to think we found a product that would help our dog without the huge cone . 
the biggest issue is that the earpiece is just way ,  way to big to accommodate a normal adult ear . 
i haven t had this very long but so far it s great . 
luckily  for me  my mom bought this expensive toy for my son . 
temperature surfing , better beans ,  roasting my own beans ,  adjusting the boiler pressure ,  darker roasts . 
before you dismiss my review ,  hear me out . 
way to small ,  if you have a larger butt like i do they wont fit . 
they werent !  for microsoft to have released this piece of drek is irresponsible in the extreme . 
the enemies can know you are there ,  and most time they will just shoot at your direction . 
after a few uses ,  the gasket failed and started to lose pressure . 
it was difficult for me to get a good sight picture . 
we even used warm water so the kids didn t have to stick their hands in cold goo . 
honestly ,  this cologne is too strong and caused several migraines  with just one spray !   . 
sound quality far better ,  radios are smaller in size and they still work . 
the second unit emitted the same awful burning smell . went through the same incredibly long wait to customer service . 
stations that came in clearly are now filled with interference . 
now its in the trash where trash should be . 
i made the mistake of throwing out the box or i would have returned it . 
i would buy something else if you want cute little princesses to play with . 
i finally asked him to call me using the number i included upon first contact . 
these scissors are too small and hurt my finger . 
it broke the first time i tried to use it . 
i was satisfied with the workmanship ,  color and twill pattern of the material . 
he is not a locksmith or a professional burglar .  .  .  . he is a twelve year old kid with a fish hook . 
the charger is obviously used as the tag on the cord is very well used . 
you barely tilt the device and it gets hard to see . 
it s packed with large size pieces of fruit . 
and since i bought this used ,  vince and co . 
i m reviewing factions from the trilogy game set that i got . 
durable ,  pretty ,  pricey ,  and not for my cat . 
no matter what i do if on the move these headsets will cutout . 
for a disposable ,  it actually looks pretty decent . 
it has the same plastic logo as the first pair . 
i only got to use the cable connections ,  never got time to setup a wireless connection . 
like everybody else i had assumed ,  that toy is tested . 
three more before lunch and plan to take three more before dinner . 
i played for about num_num minutes and couldn t take it anymore . 
the berries are of good quality ,  but i find them rather tasteless and too sweet . 
i tried to explain the ipad num_num is the new ipad ,  but they weren t getting it . 
i don t even mind that the battery powered thomas typically eats an aa battery every day or two . 
it also drops a puddle of juice under the peeler as it removes the core and slices the fruit . 
grill leaves uncooked areas if height is irregular ,  like a chicken breast . 
the moisturising is good though ,  probably another fragrance would have been good . 
so ,  the actual flavor of the bars wasnt bad . 
the signal reception on this device sucks ,  simply put . 
and this definitely started occurring the day i started using the battery . 
one stuck on all flips and ended up a crumbly mess . 
a family member and myself decided to get cradle holders for out iphones . 
i have a standard screen protector on my phone . 
the fan unit is plastic and cheesy looking !  it s certainly not a quality fan . 
i actually gave it away after two uses to my friend . 
if they are wearing such large jackets and the name is camp fire ,  then i m guessing it s really cold . 
it is not as water proof as they claim . 
this num_extend player only lasted two weeks in my possession . 
i had a very % dollars cheap ruler extension same like this but cheap . 
if you like it ,  buy it and enjoy it . 
obviously n is here but if you just want wireless  g  avoid this one . 
this product has gone down hill and will never buy again . 
the beeping quickly became overly annoying ,  so i removed the batteries . 
be warned :  this product connects only to the old ipods ,  that have the firewire port . 
the edge of this spatula has melted and i can remove the excess with my thumbnail . 
this thing fits like hammer pants for my torso . 
well ,  first off the battery was dead out of the package . 
i d only order this when deeply discounted to use as a noodle base for other dishes . 
i just gave up using it and feel like it was money wasted . 
i am afraid it will be a great disappointment as well . 
i would have still tried it on my skin though if i could have gotten past the smell . 
this vacuum lasted me only about num_num months . 
then the game leaves you hanging with it s lack of excitement . 
separates fat from liquids well ,  but does not pour well at all . 
i primarily feed her taste of the wild dry food which she thrives on . 
lament of innocence has a few moments of platforming throwbacks ,  but they re ruined by the game s unmovable camera . 
the ingredients are water ,  then sugar cane ,  and then grape and lemon juice . 
these are very flimsy and the volume control doesn t work well . 
this toy was completely unusable for our dog . 
if one chooses to be a fish keeper ,  do it the right way ,  or skip the hobby all together . 
it would be nice if there were a  play  mode that would just play the song . 
it s very pretty but not finished on the back side . 
in this day and age this is pretty old school . 
i have a very hard time using these . 
you have three  windows  on your rifle to see where your bullets are going . 
and the after care wipes were slightly oily and seem to sooth well . 
for the num_extend use ,  i couldn t get the  mercury  to go lower than num_extend of the earlier reading . 
i wasn t checking that often ,  and the mouse began to mummify and rot ,  and smelled nasty . 
i went out and bought nhl num_extend was promptly disappointed ,  sold that game and waited for this . 
i personally do not want any extra chemicals in my body !  . 
i have used other brands with no problem . 
so there appears to be a defective batch of these leashes in amazon s inventory . 
my dog just ate the part of the bone sticking out . 
it must be terrible to be a baby and get all kinds of flavorless food . 
not for an adult as some folks suggest in these posts . 
however ,  the stone does not fit into the oven . 
the main interest seems to be taking the clay apart ,  not making something with it . 
i ve had this backpack for a little over a year now . 
and i was not recontaminating myself ,  i assure you . 
after trying several mounts ,  it is the best . 
this is the first product i purchased from amazon that did not work as advertised . 
you see ,  reviews are written for people who have not made up their minds . 
i have emailed your inquiry and he will be touching base when gets back in the office . 
i ve used this product before and it worked fine . 
sorry n rage ,  you just didn t do it for me . 
i returned it got another disc and that disc was defective too . 
i better stick with the tough indestructable rubber ones for this dog . 
the shirt looks ok ,  the color and size is nice ,  so is the cut . 
the rubber button that you press to make it work came out of this hole . 
after reading such rave reviews about this product ,  i figured i would give it a try . 
if you go cheap ,  you can go home . 
to be fair ,  the truck has num_extend and this could just be the natural lifespan of the sensor . 
it works for some but not for others . 
i received this product after a long wait . 
buy one item that will last forever .  .  . this is not an item that will last forever . 
even at discount ,  this is not a cheap toy . as for the toy . 
that s a manufacturer problem as it was stamped that way both on the bottle and the box . 
does block the camera lens a little bit . 
the pen also needs to be completely flat on the iphone screen in order to work at all . 
this puller is made reasonably well and i like the clip for easy attachment to my range pants . 
this is absolutely the worst shaver i ve had in quite a while . 
this antenna is not strong enough to pick up fm stations . 
this just didn t get the job done reliably enough for me . 
my two year old son was very excited when i bought him the desk ,  but he quickly lost interest . 
i got one of these as a gift . 
update :  captain katie says you should know it s hard to find the limited edition now . 
the first time ,  all the extra buttons on the keyboard stopped working in under an hour . 
dont want to risk $ to save $
items i have cooked with it felt like i put sand in the recipe . 
my cat is not too enticed about this toy . 
i picked these up on a gold box special for $
it is heavy and there is rubber on the grip . 
i was looking for a cheaper alternative to clinique and didn t find it here . 
i would give this product a much better review had it been delivered to me in a new condition . 
my hair came out an ugly brown  my hair was already a medium brown  . 
and don t worry about completing superman num_num in a short period of time ,  either . 
i ve played this game for about num_num minutes and simply became disgusted . 
power off the printer and power it back on doesn t do anything as well . 
no white chocolate except a teeny tiny thin layer on the outside . 
i recommend you to get a couple of deluxe toys instead of this . 
it needs another ingredient such as piperazine or phytosomes to enhance absorption . 
we paid $ for a heavy regular swiffer sweeper . 
the colors in the game are really bad . 
i encountered no gristle or otherwise inedible pieces . the packaging is interesting . 
i should learn to read feedback before purchasing . 
was hoping this would take care of a uti . 
i gave the remainder of the case to a friend whose cat loves it . 
i ve only had this bag for num_num days and it already seems to be coming apart . 
the little straps  eyelets  are completely uneven on one shoe and it looks ridiculous . 
somehow i missed the detail that this was a  tingle  product . 
no matter how much i try ,  he hates it and didn t give it a second look . i ll be donating it . 
maybe it would have worked better applied at night ,  since i couldn t rub it in . 
i will continue to use it ,  but not at full strength . 
the cups folded over once the bra was on and hooked !  !  !  . 
it does work for that purpose ,  but is not at all reliable . 
sometimes certain triggers would not work even though i spent hours inspecting them . 
num_extend when i contacted the manufacturer ,  i got no reply . 
i like the idea and was bummed it didn t work . 
what is required is a male full size to male mini cable . 
this is very marginal quality that you would expect from the num_extend
just received this item and was disappointed with the quality . 
i gave it this star because i don t see how it fits in the machine . 
i got this for my wife as she works out a lot . 
when i applied them to the phone i have they were a little undersized . 
total bummer and dog has no interest after rolling it around for num_num seconds . 
they however ,  are num_num times more fun ,  and don t require a montly fee . 
that is all that it has going for it . 
save you money and get the actual toobeez set . 
the wire leading in to the earbud either comes loose ,  or dissolves with use . 
cheap dont buy it !  its like chalk and smells like it to . 
i bought this vornado heater from amazon . com about num_num years ago . 
after slowly inflated the tire to num_num psi ,  i waited num_num hours before checking the tire . 
i would return this but it is stuck to my car door . 
i have been searching for a lower cost alternative to ddf s glycolic acid cleanser and i ordered this one . 
now after charging all night ,  i can t even turn them on . 
a friend recommended another brand that i faithfully purchased until it was no longer available . 
have no idea if he has used it or not . 
i couldn t stand to be near my dog ,  and it didn t seem to make his ears any less itchy . 
i could not get into this boring crap . 
i see some of the creative toys being made today and stuff like this just doesn t compare . 
nintendo needs to either take it one step forward or one step back . 
first time i hooked it up nothing would work . 
amazon did refund me the money from the case . 
this bluetooth is excellent except for the auto volume is very loud . 
it s carbonated but is all natural and is % juice . 
however ,  they just don t fit my body type right . 
to be fair ,  the audio sound quality is pretty good for the price .  .  . in the right ear . 
the boss theme is especially good , though ,  one of the best i ve heard . 
i thought i could get into astronomy but i was wrong . 
the other two formed bubbles after a few days of putting it on . 
even though they may sound great ,  these speakers only play num_extend sound unless you have a direct digital connection . 
my little one now just pushes it around the lawn or back yard pretending to cut grass . 
this is a review of this product : driver num_num  playstation video game  . 
he d thought that this device would be more useful that it has proven to be . 
it s a shame this product doesn t hold air . 
i ve tried numerous brands of stevia and this is not worth the price . 
even with the rollers my hair just layed flat and half curled . 
but ,  we never saw ,  because my son still thinks it s lame and does not play with it . 
i have had a few wallet cases for the iphone and prefer the ones with a more slim profile . 
cheap version of the real thing .  .  . but i kind of knew that by previous reviews . 
this garage was very difficult to put together . 
i thought i would use it on my tiny yorkie s face and legs ,  but it doesn t work well . 
the only sources of soluble nitrogen allowed under organic regulations are compost teas and various manures . 
a broader ,  cleaner white background would have improved this item a great deal . 
i loved it and it worked perfectly ,  but only for about a month . 
the next morning ,  however ,  my hair was incredibly flat and full of static . 
and says anycall instead of samsung on the charger block . 
compared to other brands of instant soup cups ,  annie chun s hot and sour soup bowl is pretty darn good . 
the taste reminded me of some sulfur medication i had when i was a child . 
the music gets very tedious after awhile; everytime an enemy approaches you get the same annoying music . 
i threw it away after the first week snce he never touched it again . 
i swear a num_num year old must have written this monstrosity . 
not two weeks after i put these on the a string broke close to the ball on the string . 
i did feel the  burning  sensation other people claimed . 
i stopped using it because i want to keep my eye lashes . 
i m going to try it one more time ,  and ,  then ,  consider it a lost cause !  . 
to me it tastes like the awful flavored bigelow green tea series . 
i did beat the current price ,  but at $ they are still worth it . 
this was purchase as auxiliary cable for my bmw . 
however ,  when it got here ,  it didn t waste any time making me a very unhappy customer . 
given that the toy does very little ,  this i believe is a major flaw . 
i have a cat who is urinating next to ,  but not in the litter box . 
every single one of them gave me the same problem . 
the tips on these things  smoosh  all over the place ,  making precise contacts difficult  for me ,  at least  . 
after all ,  with the difficulty of these puzzles ,  rest assured ,  you ll be looking for one !  . 
buy headphones from koss  sportapro  the ideal headphones for this unitcheers !  . 
and i m willing to bet dynasty warriors num_num is just on the horizon .  .  . with the exact game mechanics . 
sound was coming too low no matter what . 
i purchased a virbac tick collar ,  but haven t tried yet . 
it s fantastic ,  and i finally got around to ordering one for home use . 
not built correctly and it squeezes my foot and leaves a bruise . 
at first it smelled like mango and it was ok . 
i was afraid of breaking the new ipod . 
but now apparently a new company has bought nioxin and they have clearly changed the ingredients in the conditioner . 
nice bass ,  good treble and overall very clean room filling sound . 
your child and you will not find these as much fun . 
i don t profess to know a lot about mercury poisoning ,  but it doesn t really matter . 
i ve pulled it down over my forehead like the picture and tied it tightly ,  but it still falls off . 
the corner started peeling up and of course couldn t be stuck down again . 
i ordered it because it is loose flowing so perfect for wide bodies . 
as i continue to play pool of radiance ,  my opinion of it has grown steadily worse . 
i m not saying that to bash someone s sexuality in any way ,  but this guy is way over the top . 
it seems to help people with knee problems but i had no luck with it . 
the four month life span i got out of these did dissapoint . 
i completely understand and accept a free market economy . 
looks cool on a shelf ,  that s about it . 
thought it would be fun to play with . 
i have horrible visions of this top flying off and wasting my cocoa powder all over the place . 
not enough fabric to dig into and cover themselves ,  and the fabrics were to stiff and small . 
or the digital camera would not stay connected to its software . 
do not buy these with the teal blue fabric you will waste your money . 
my daughter had a very hard time understanding what to do . 
the narrow size is ok but the shoe slides up and down on my heal making them very uncomfortable . 
bought the spray sense collar which works great . 
these stylus are a bit flimsy and the rubber tip doesn t do a good job . 
the chair is going into the trash ,  it is now beyond saving . 
well ,  these colors are just like using crayons  imho  . 
have a bulk pack of extra batteries on hand . 
i bought this product because of the advertised  no clump brush  . 
the environments were mildly nice ,  but felt awfully bland . 
you can t mold it against your skin like you could something pliable like a towel . 
but i think that could be because i have a screen protector . 
not sure whether it is my windows ,  or my printer . 
the pockets just disintegrated when attempting to form them around a pill . 
this works sometimeshowever ,  most of the time ,  it refuses to charge and even overheats your device . 
and ,  everything i thought i d hate about it i did . 
past thirty days so i can t get any money back . 
it went in the trash on return home . 
i have submerged it halfway in my num_extend pool ,  but i m still kinda scared to sumberge it many times . 
so if your looking for protection do not buy . 
the other tried to eat one ,  spat out what he had eaten and refused to eat more . 
i love their music and the porn stars they used in this game ,  but this was just horrible . 
my vet told me it only works % of the time . 
we may keep it and use it as some kind of piggy bank . 
after ordering this bag ,  i remembered why i sold the first one . 
but there are way too many parts to assemble . 
kirkland  costco  has substitutes most of the chocolates with cheaper chocolates . 
then i finally decided enough is enough and bought a new mr . 
i purchased quality led bulbs cheaper that will last as long as i own my car . 
people throw them away because the flint is depleted . 
i have standard size bands and this tool is just too small . 
the sound quality was good but it picked up way to much room noise . 
however ,  i was disappointed at how it turned out . 
was very disappointed and it was a waste of money . 
i love anastasia products ,  but this pencil did not glide on so easily . 
i also don t like that there are only num_num shapes when you can get sorters with a lot more . 
their products are much better suited for my needs . 
you have a external power supply to hook up to it then you need a speaker wire . 
this holster is designed for a num_num with a very narrow trigger guard . 
did no realize that this game was so old or i would not have purchased it . 
the hinges popped off when i opened it . 
it has little balls inside the mask that makes it very uncomfortable . 
in addition ,  muscular legs will just not fit into these pants comfortably . 
this game should be in the platinum hits sections . 
i could easily bake a much better cake at half the cost and twice the quality . 
so i ordered myself some but it takes forever ro receive it !  so im giving only num_num stars !  . 
this product is made for dogs with flat broad chests . 
imagine having to toilet and breathe in such a filthy environment day after day after day . 
when you ,  push something on the touchscreen it might take num_num seconds for the phone to respond . 
anyway next review will be the real streets of rage num_num bare knuckle iii . 
even though it looks just like the original ,  it charges super slowly . 
the sound quality out of these is terrible . 
i have been cramping and miserable for about num_num hours now . 
i did not use this timer very often after purchase . 
certainly ,  the solution attracts fruit flies ,  but not all that well . 
i went looking for some winter boots that were not only functional but attractive . 
as for the chocolate flavor ,  it is a bit artificial for me . 
i got it just as an add on to my order to get free shipping . 
i had a problem with the item ,  contacted schwinn numerous times ,  and was absolutely ignored . 
having dropped and shattered a glass french press before ,  i thought i d give it a try . 
just doing it one time gives u a blister . 
she told me to tryworld s best cat litter ,  multiple cat clumping formula ,  num_num lbs . 
it takes sharp photos with great color under all conditions . 
kellogs you missed the boat with this one . 
one size fits all was not meant for me . 
this is a huge bag of the repellent . 
just give us ournabisco honey maid graham crackers num_num pack value boxplease . 
they re not perfect ,  but it works ,  and the dogs like it . 
regrettably netgear did not get the job done . 
the entire system is rather well done ,  but is still afflicted by many bugs . 
first ,  the sound quality is just not very high . 
third ,  even the hardest setting puzzle was ridiculously easy . 
it was heartbreaking and i can t figure out why he had such a negative reaction to the asian fusion . 
this camera just never gets the picture you want . 
it worked great ,  and i got up to a good pressure without much effort . 
i will use remaining but probably will not purchase again . 
the bags would also be much better if you could tie it close like several other brands . 
i only ordered one pkg so i could try them out on my dog . 
it isn t the same over and over again ,  actually the backtracking screws that up . 
dehydration directions say that you need guar gum . 
i can t see any improvement and i got seek ,  with nausea . 
tree nut warningsurprised this has not been addressed but there is a tree nut warning on the bag . 
so it s possible the product has worked for many  besides mr . 
its a rich ,  full distortion that at higher gains gets slightly fuzzy . 
beside advent children ,  this thing doesn t have much of anything . 
it was a bit sticky ,  but didn t add definition or separate curls or any of that nonsense . 
i turned out to be one of the latter people . 
just a cheap cd envelope and brochure type key card . 
there is no way to cancel out background noise lest your own voice be considered to be background noise . 
anything over this price is simply a waste of money . 
together ,  we can make these safer for our dogs . i think i have come up with a temporary solution . 
volume sucks ,  its either too loud or too low . 
the charactors all run ,  shoot ,  dribble ,  and move the same . 
it bends and flexes easily and cracks with minimal effort . 
ordered the size that works for me in all other styles and brands . 
i even bought a different phone to try it on . 
that is cold ! what s happened to american made stanley ?  . 
the fabric is soft at least ,  and it is easy care . 
the wooden letters are covered on one side with a thin piece of colored paper instead of being painted . 
i poured the water for a couple of hours to clean . 
make sure your childs clothes are not covered or they will get stained . 
after one week the left channel started making strange noises . 
sorry supes .  .  . but this game was a let down . 
you get what you pay for i guess . 
 reviewed elsewhere i m writing this as i m not sure what to do next . 
i cannot find anything on the jar to indicate an expiration date . 
now its just a clear case with a few water spots . 
it s a good way to use up these tablets . i no longer take these tablets on their own . 
replace the sheath and this makes a cheap hunting knife . 
so it is also hard to perceive depth . 
reviewers note :  throughout this review the product is referred to as dragon quest vii and not dragon warrior vii . 
it actually looked like i got struck by a huge lightning bolt . 
it is now the end of december and i still have no espresso machine . 
so after a num_extend download ,  i connected my leapfrog explorer and it unsuccessfully tried to download yet another update . 
they put a nice dent in the movie making this . 
maxell quality is usually pretty good ,  but they missed the bar with these . 
this product gets super hot ,  but the plates are not very good for my type of hair . 
not to mention that getting that crap on my fingers was just nasty . 
the yellowish camo on the case makes the case looked like used . 
they should have stayed where they were and bumped up the price some . 
i was having a problem with a groundhog that was loving some of my cabbage plants to death  literally  . 
cats showed no interest . da bird is the best cat toy available . 
the games range from something a num_num year old could do ,  to something your grandmother might play . 
i remember shelling out the money to buy this product ,  like the ignorant fool i was . 
this didn t help me sleep better or with anythign else that i can tell . 
i bought this because just about all the reviews said it was good . 
doesn t mix well at all . lastly ,  all this  orac  hype ,  yet i noticed absolutely zero benefits of taking it . 
i suggest visiting macworld to read their reviews of other wireless mice to consider one of those instead . 
but i can t use mine often because like i said its too loud . 
my lashes looked the same after using as they did after using . 
i felt led by the nose in this linear drama . 
i chose the sony set because it seemed the least expensive headphone set . 
my num_num year daughter was so excited until she did about num_num of the experiments . 
i love popcorners with sea salt ,  but do not like the kettle flavor . 
the shell holder itself is of good quality for about $ but i have no use for it . 
this blow dryer vibrates terribly in your hand while using and that makes it very uncomfortable . 
my mother still has the original barbie one i played with as a child . 
i wish i had researched more and got something better instead . 
after reading all of the reviews it seemed like this is the product i was looking for . 
these were the best value . after a year of using and washing ,  these get rusty . 
my bras don t fit on it at all and i m only a num_extend
i made one batch for five mins .  ,  one for three mins . 
i loved the series from num_extend to its fourth game on the num_extend and playstation . 
i tried adjusting them several times ,  but they were not comfortable . 
you don t really learn anything about the character you control . 
l oreal makes many hair color brands ,  the superior preference brand is just terrible to apply . 
it kept me up all night long !  had to get up early for work num_extend a . m . 
in the past num_num years ,  many of them have been starting to break on me . 
a couple of washes and they would be done . 
all of my plants are being eaten by these invaders so i gave this product a try . 
just what is the problem with remote reliability ?  . 
i have been there and done that and am finally healed from the worst of the worst of candida . 
i used to love the old zico when it went straight from the coconut into the container . 
i returned immediately and wouldn t recommend it to anyone . 
i even thought i broke something at one point but ,  i num_extend remote . 
but you take a boat in the air that you don t love . 
so i wanted to use this w my acoustic bass and violin . 
also the microphone didn t work and neither did the other button . 
psst made a small improvement ,  but no where near what i was used to with tresemme s dry shampoo line . 
they also can t do lighter genres like jazz and classical due to their poor positoning . 
so i was hoping this would work with my mac ,  and it has a very bare bones functionality . 
i m not even sure where it is anymore . 
do the math ,  and you will find that the num_num pack is less per battery than the num_num pack . 
i got one as a present and it works great and fits better on my ear . 
but didn t work good . waste of money in purchasing this . 
the breeze pads  which are expensive even when you buy them in bulk  are supposed to be  odor free  . 
honestly ,  i m not sure how much these work for the pain of arthritis . 
you must use your ingenuity and several different programs to load and maintain your data and music . 
so i must urge the reader :  do not purchase this product . 
i tried num_extend num_extend e ,  num_extend d ,  num_extend e . 
there is some weird taste that i just can t get past . 
i had it for years without any problems whatsoever . 
i will be honest ,  this is the most useless product i have ever purchased for my cat . 
well yet again is another game sold that would not save due to corruption issues . 
you battle time on top of the many tasks that lay before you . 
let me know if i am wrong ,  and i will remove this review . 
if forced to say something nice ,  i d note there were no side effects either . 
the bag will still be useful ,  i suppose ,  and it s not very expensive . 
for instance .  .  .  . mafia ii is a lot better game . 
it might be cheap ,  but trust me ,  it s not worth it . 
now i can use more potent products with out having my skin flake off and burn . 
my daughter disliked it and frankly so did i . 
not a comfortable wear ,  equivalent to buying from local walmart or thrift store . 
i really wanted this one to work since the reviews were so amazing . 
however ,  my biggest complaint is that the bottom rod has burnt out after just one year of use . 
now i am stuck with num_num num_num packs of soup i can t force myself to eat . 
any longer and you should be checking your pulse . 
the sunglassess fit too snug on a big head . 
the lenses were always fogged and then a permanent cloud settled in the lenses ,  making them almost useless . 
nor have i ever had this issue with any other under eye gel . 
you have to be a contortionist to get the iron at the correct angle and roll it up smoothly . 
the socks were so narrow i was not able to get it over my hand and arm . 
for now we will glue the broken piece and put it aside for future use . 
not as good as the doc s other products for sure . 
after num_num years of taking vitamins i tried animal pak because of the positive reviews . 
the same that i wrote for the sewell . 
wish i had listened to other reviewers on this one !  . 
when i first put this on ,  it looked perfect . 
it has num_extend of total fat with num_extend of saturated fat . the front of the package says ,   deliciously natural nutrition  . 
the glass from the filter put a very small nick on the edge of my $ lens . 
and the phosporescent watch hands fade in about an hour ,  so that doesn t help much . 
sony customer support recommendations are first to clean the cd s and second to unplug the unit and reset it . 
this unit worked til the warranty ran out then jammed with my media inside . 
not wanting to risk poisoning my animal i asked to send it back . 
he has atari ,  spongebob ,  blue s clues ,  et al . 
marshmallows ,  milk chocolate and some of the unhealthiest oils and saturated fats are the primary ingredients of these cookies . 
now i like hello kitty ,  but i do not like this case . 
buy the looks of the launch titles they all seem to be ports from the num_extend
when i originally used this it just slid along the concrete and the wheel didn t roll on to it . 
this shoe is sized much smaller for a given size than the fila counterpart . 
opening the slipper box i pulled out the slippers and saw that the bottoms were dirty . 
it s a hack that gives you unlimited health ,  but that takes alot of fun out . 
i never removed it from its case ,  it just eventually started cracking under normal use . 
even with freshly ground beans ,  the coffee was not good . 
these batteries only last for about an hr after putting one in . 
but they are not pleasant to listen to . 
so much for simple . not sure why it is so particular . 
similarly ,  the online maintenance schedule hadn t been updated to include this model  the ultra  . 
she loves sitting in it ,  but just as long as she s not strapped in to it . 
if you just want a toy ,  you will find this to be barely adequate . 
they come with absolutely no instructions or what they are called . 
i generally buy garden of eatin  all the time num_extend cases a month  ,  but no more . 
it is  gel  so it does allow nails to be protected . 
the fit of the boot was ok ,  but the top of the neck was too tight . 
i bought that for my grandson ,  and he still plays with it at almost num_num years old . 
but i could detect a very very faint whiff of menthol with that many patches on me . 
horrible quality  i m only num_num feet away  plus the static is tremendous . 
i purchased this same battery in white ,  and it works great . 
the odor control isn t so good with feline pine ,  however ,  much like pine mixed with well ,  feces . 
it s a matter of ,  build enough items and the casino will fill up . 
however ,  this lavender scent is not as clean . 
in my mind that is  mild  language ,  however ,  that is not the extent of the severity of the language . 
the first time i used it was on a num_extend lodge fry pan . 
for me this did not go on smoothly . 
they say this accessory is not supported everytime i plug it in . 
and was much more painful than i anticipated since i heard it was supposed to be gentle !  . 
it got an extra star for being blue . 
just because an aftermarket battery says nfc doesn t mean it really is . 
a bolt connection would have been a better connection ,  more of a theft deterrent ,  and likely smaller . 
i personally received money back from the company for the airborne i had purchased due to the false advertising . 
i absolutely love this product ,  unfortunately they don t sell it in stores anymore . 
this rat trap is designed pretty much like any standard mouse trap . 
on its own ,  this does not work at all . 
i don t know if mine are defective or if it is just the quality of the binocs . 
my dogs would not stop eating grass after every bowl . 
our son was given this last year for christmas . 
this one is cheap as well and constantly comes apart . 
in this regard it was a great purchase . 
i have been playing mario num_num ds for a few weeks now . 
i am a huge fan of the nancy drew games . 
from that perspective it does deserve num_num stars because i hate this thing . 
random times ,  the aiming just would not work . 
i feel confident these bodum and bonjour double wall designs will break eventually due to this stress . 
the picture quality is so low that only about % of the photos are worth keeping . 
well personally i havent got a new nascar game since num_extend
i do not hold them to blame as many customers have had no issues whatsoever . 
but i just could not grow to like it . 
i have a top of the line gaming cpu btw .  .  . i wish i could rate it lower than one star . 
unfortunately i am just  a fool and her money  with a very spoiled dog !  . 
this one is probably the worst that i ve tried . 
you can only win this game is you are lucky . 
low volume background noise very frequently ,  but the most dismaying problem was an occasional very high volume screeching sound . 
i didn t see that stevia is an ingredient . 
she said it worked fine on her underarm ,  but not well at all on her legs . 
i ve enjoyed every game i ve played for it . 
will be looking for a new pooper scooper . 
as sharp as the lens is going to get anyway for the kit lens . 
i hate to sound too nasty but this thing was just horrible !  i just sent it back . 
the num_num is nice but the num_num is fine for most applications . 
this unit did not work well with my phone . 
this butterfly closure is to thick and not plyable . 
wife saw no improvement in her knees after num_num weeks . 
it smells good and acts like a conditionner . 
those most susceptible are children and the elderly .   . 
our son needed pans for college ,  and i bought a couple of these in different sizes . 
i am impressed by the brightness of the lens . 
it stays on ok ,  but it just makes me look like my lips don t exist . 
in any case ,  i hope this helps . finally ,  based on my return experience ,  i can certainly recommend amazon for electronics . 
which sucks ,  because the default ringtones num_extend pictures folder . 
o . k .  ,  i m going to offer a counterpoint to all the positive reviews . 
also ,  my hair looked limp and i didn t notice any shine . 
at least it was cheap and i m not out much . 
i liked the idea of this but when i received it ,  it was not functioning . 
why is this !  it s not like we re going to run out of room . 
others might have a different reaction ,  but this product is one i can do without . 
i wonder if it might actually be the  oat kernel flour  that does this ?  colloidal oatmeal is a powder . 
i could not believe how ugly these crocs were when i opened the box . 
the range is so short and narrow ,  it will nit detect most of the time at all . 
if in the middle of conversation when this happened ,  i had to become a one handed driver . 
the jacket fit ok in the sleeve length and the overall length of the jacket . 
the game informer review said everything about this game . 
it had clumps in it ,  almost like yogurt . 
my feet actually hurt worse with the superfeet inserts and i gave them a good week to break in . 
then we tried it again a little later and no go . 
however ,  that will no longer be a problem as the heating element died today . 
it s probably the same size of a beach ball that you would purchase at your local dollar store . 
i expect at this price to get at least a month . 
used it once and bent the damn thing . 
if it weren t for the fact that it really is a good idea that looks very neat . 
i will look for another form of magnesium that can be absorbed more efficiently next time ,  and in capsules . 
they sort of make you feel like you re watching an anime film . 
when it suddenly stopped working altogether one day i returned it to get a replacement . 
i hadn t realized how strongly tinted green this was . 
about one third of my playing time was devoted to this stupidity . 
i guess i will go back to my brush . 
wow ,  was i looking forward to this after the great reviews . 
the shampoo contains paraben ,  which is carcinogenic ,  and sls ,  which is a skin irritant and a probable carcinogen . 
i bought it thinking i was going to love it . 
the tagstand app is the best whether you use these or not . 
they are not worth it for any price . 
we had num_num and very happy with them . 
it s bad enough when the other player has a hard time interacting with the game world . 
i started playing ,  but soon quit as the visuals were rather primitive . 
well ,  one of them did not work at all . 
i asked if they will automatically credit them back once the replacement arrives . 
there is nothing perfect about this game ,  so that right there is false advertising . 
i was able to tune chicago stations with ease . 
the problem is that when you take it out of its case ,  your phone is completely unprotected . 
this should have posted the gauge for the wire which would help decide if it will work for you . 
but it won t if the plastic is cheap and the workmanship sleazy . 
who am i supposed to blame ,  opteka ,  num_extend st photo ,  or amazon . com ?  . 
the longest it ever held connection was a full num_num hours which i thought was sheer magic . 
pathetic . to add insult to injury ,  they re fastened by not one ,  but two rings  wow !   . 
besides that it dies seem to be sturdy and well made . 
and you have to reapply from time to time to make sure the color is consistent . 
it was a great port from the consoles ,  with enough changes to make it fun on the pc . 
nonetheless ,  i still rely on a good eye cream to make it through the day . 
it may look festive ,  but the baby blue polka flex gel case could have been so much better . 
i thought this product might be helpful in reducing the number of times she needed to use her inhaler . 
this is not really a serious gaming experience ,  its more of an exercise in futility . 
the gasket does a fine job of holding the water in ,  just by the way . 
the plates are not quite smooth enough for my very curly hair . 
i read another review where the writer complained about the lack of labeling . 
but now you need to trim this piece into smaller pieces . 
i took these over a period of a couple weeks . 
you ll need to oil or lubricate your firearm after using this but it does dry quickly and cleans well . 
there s the loud sub that does tend towards boomy and there s the tinny sats . 
i am surprised that some people think this sounds good . 
amazon ,  as usual ,  made the ordeal as smooth as possible . 
i read many of the reviews about how to make great popcorn and adjustments in the arm . 
i personally like these games very much so i expected rayman num_num to be a great platformer game . 
i have used several competitors and i like them all better . 
so if you re a fan ,  you can follow along . 
i mostly make smoothies and similar textured things and this blender can t keep a blendable mass moving . 
you can turn it all you like and thegrind remains unchanged . second ,  one of mine died . 
what amazon is presently selling isn t what you re getting . 
the picture cards are double sided and it comes with a decent number of cards . 
need the maximum strength to remove gell nails easily . 
i installed the covers ,  opened and brushed the caps against my jacket .  .  . broke right off . 
but you can not pull back far enough to engage the spring . 
for someone with smaller hands ,  it s unwieldy ,  heavy and clumsy to hold . 
i wrote this about five minutes after finishing a cup ,  and i still have a terrible ,  bitter aftertaste . 
does not compare to the quality of the teeter . 
meant to be used with a drill instead of a buffer . 
i remember in classic killing a new boss was actually an accomplishment . 
the lid cracks and pops as it heats up and cools down . 
the joke is that this deodorant is not the one we received ,  even though we wanted this one . 
this shield is num_num inches so it fits the narrow num_num qt bowls ,  not the num_num plus ones . 
i strongly recommend against the purchase of this remote . full review : i am a professional software developer . 
i just could not get these to work with my mosin . 
the splitter was the culprit ,  not allowing good signal through . 
pulling the cartridge box to reload is very difficult . 
if it is that ,  though ,  i m not sure if thats a mercy or a bad judgement . 
i tried it for three nights and nothing . 
the support is good ,  but a bit tight . 
it looks like i have num_extend glasses on and am walking around in the sun . 
i tried every single radio station i could find . 
the cereal does live up to its middle name ,  vanilla . 
huawei is not ready for the us market . 
i slowly developed terrible acne and had to stop using it . 
most treasure chests are filled with only healing berries  really lame  . 
my num_num star as rated before ,  is now num_num star . 
just don t set your expectations very high ,  and you won t be disappointed . 
i thought this was a full page magnifier . 
i purchased this bag to keep my wii games and nunchucks in . 
you can t tweak individual buildings ,  or really get into the management of a city as you would like to . 
it just did not handle well at all . 
the strands were very loosly twisted and tended to unravel . 
a simple dc jack in the unit would be nice . 
i bought both for $ on sale at cvs . 
i tried this product with my conair hot rollers and ,  it does not set my hair properly . 
as for the lemon ,  it s just flavorful enough to provide a sour background to the concentrated spiciness . 
if you love your pet ,  at least check them out . 
i purchased this in the hopes that i would get a fresh tub . 
i returned it and tried a second one just in case it was defective . 
seems like it s a little more difficult to rinse off than other washes . 
i still have it but it also has a few layers of dust on it . 
kid  not pet  safe ,  and indoors only . mouse killer iii :  refillable . 
this product is not really useful with gigia products as they say . 
i m not sure why they made the white one this way but looks and feels like poor quality . 
unfortunately the smell of this product is so intense it makes me feel sick when i open the bottle . 
i changed channels and it worked for like a minute then went dead . 
first ,  the one i got does not have a brushed exterior . 
i lost the charger a couple weeks after buying and i was glad i did . 
i rinsed the canister and filter material ,  connected everything ,  primed it and it went to work upon plugging in . 
my review is directed towards camp fire use . 
shotty block where none of the knives fit in right . 
my physical therapist told me to buy this ,  but it didn t work for me . 
why so many ,  you may be asking ?  i have no clue . 
i bought this game for my grandson and then found out it had way too much cussing and violence . 
the capsule is the size of a nfl football and difficult to swallow . 
i dropped it about num_num times from my face to the sink and the head came clean off . 
i had two in one day and woke up with terrible stomach pains the next morning . 
this came and i was excited to get my laptop temp .  ,  down . 
this is a solid part to this system . 
it took me forever to get it off . 
for some reason the ones i ordered from amazon are horrible . 
the caw feature in num_extend is not as good as the first . wwe should drop thq . 
but if they treated madden this way and added arcade elements then america would revolt . 
that s how narrow reefs run . second ,  if you don t have high arches ,  avoid this sandal . 
after purchasing again realized this chamois is too thin and will not hold up with repeated usage . 
it did however hold up to the abuse . 
i m going to stick with the halo headband . 
very tall and skinny and tips over very easily . 
i have three cats ,  one with a mild aggression problem and one that likes to chew . 
these socks do not fit as knee socks . 
well ,  forget that !  the talking box won t go over the loops to get it on . 
i ve used both peppermint and orange flavored versions of the source naturals coenzymate b complex . 
the second one within num_num and the final within a week . 
he modelled them for me as a laugh ,  but was very uncomfortable in them . 
i could not use this product because amazon includes the wrong antenna for this product . 
i believe it was overstimulating her in a negative way . 
he gets bored when it stops moving and walks away . 
i was very disappointed in this crate  which i bought at a local feed store  . 
oh yeah ,  i can t even figure out how to uninstall it from my system . 
and there is something really neat about a spinning disc on a turntable . 
i don t have very thick hair but it constantly bogs down . 
free shipping on the item num_extend ounce and much lower cost . 
you need to wear your own shirt underneath or not use the tie . 
they are easy to read and pour very well ,  and they nest for storage . 
i ordered the wrong part and had to return it . 
i ll probably use this as a highlighter or just give it away . 
when i got this piece of crap ,  i put it on my phone ,  and it was peeling . 
but i cannot for the life of me understand why this is a franchise . 
i bought this deodorant for my husband and he got allergic reaction to it . 
its worst then the screen itself . update :  changing the rating to one star . 
i just can t hack the concentration of that undercurrent of bitter earthiness like nuts sometimes have . 
num_extend doesn t include those instructions in their mediocre manual . 
i brewed a pot of this but found it too strong . 
it erratically either won t turn on or it won t turn off . 
i m not happy ,  not even a little bit . 
polder had a real winner here and they completely blew it . 
my younger cat loved this toy; my elderly cat is frightened by it . 
i think that this is what makes these headphones so crummy . 
i can easily recognize people at num_num yards . 
it tingled but never felt like i got the oil and dead skin off . 
ralph lauren makes a lot of great products ,  but these shoes aren t them . 
the num_extend power is adequate for most situations . 
i use to have a motorola walkie talkie . 
i would recommend you save your money on this . 
the light is powerful enough to do its job . 
it s not surprising that some customers find it flying out of the slipper in clumps after brief use . 
magnesium bar is low quality ,  very hard and difficult to make shavings . 
i have to admit to not knowing what organic inulin is . 
it s well documented all over the internet how horrible it is . 
it takes about num_num million to obtain a new level . 
i bought this to back up my pictures but it died after only one year . 
it s doen t dry as fast and the crylic come off when i used my professional nail filer . 
always the cheap it ,  will be expensive on the future . 
the product is nice but it s not what i thought it would be . 
i have used iron skillets for decades and do not speak from ignorance . 
why doesn t anyone make really good ,  lightweight subtle dog bags that don t cost a fortune ?  . 
eaten one at a time ,  there is no noticeable flavor of any kind . 
the problem ? i think my babies were a little too big . 
i almost never hate a product ,  but this is the worst excuse for eyeliner ever . 
everyone at work like the boot and so did i . 
also my sweat won t ruin it . big con :  very ,  very twitchy in keeping connected to the phone . 
batteries did not charge ,  and tried several batteries to be sure it was the charger and not the batteries . 
i tried the humidifier with and without the filter and cannot tell any difference in dust output . 
somebody could have sat on it and it would ve been fine . 
that should sum up how i feel about these supposed  thinkthin  candy bars . 
especially the power supply that bulges on the outside . 
but my son is only num_num and its not a big deal ,  he can just trade them at school !  . 
i immediately turned it off ,  put it back in its packing material and returned it to amazon . 
good luck in your journey to fix your hair !  . 
this brand has uneven clumps of aloe which feel like waste product instead of a craftily created cool treat . 
oh by the way ,  that s all there is to this game . 
it s hard to find the broccoli in this chunky soup ,  since it s the size of parsley flakes . 
i bought this popcorn first for my air popper and went through it rather quickly . 
i only use it in small amounts of time ,  so it hasn t broken down or shorted out on me . 
i purchase these underwear becuase i like loose undies to sleep in and these appear comfy . 
and that s the only good thing about this waste of materials . 
didn t notice it until we were out on the water and i attempted to use it . 
if you flinch ,  start ,  jump ,  or whatever you could hurt yourself . 
i only purchased this because a friend suggested it . 
i like the price but you do get what you pay for . 
we ve had a couple sets thrown away by employees or friends who didn t realize the cells were rechargeable . 
if it works correctly ,  i ll update this review after doing a few recordings . 
i took it as a loss and threw everything away . 
switched to tdk and almost always works fine . 
there is a lot of collecting to do ,  but it really isn t fun . 
but i have never found a mouse in it . 
she flat out refused them and ignored them even when left out for her . 
you could possibly get this same ph paper for free from your doctor  if available  . 
well ,  it s better than a string and two dixie cups but rich detailed sound ?  not even close . 
it has less functionality than the model that succeeded it  the num_extend yet is more expensive . 
first ,  the wands are tiny small second ,  it clumps and makes the eyelashes look really bad . 
disney really missed the mark on this one . 
these chips give you num_extend fiber in num_extend vs . 
i got this for storing and securing items in my soft top jeep   num_num jk   . 
i also think that the packaging is unattractive; i could have designed it better myself . 
i have to buy filters for this bagless vacuum . 
no way to attach to phone and have room to reach keypad . 
i continued to use just the back cover ,  but it s tabs are losing their grip ,  too . 
also found the ups sticker over top a sticker with someone else s name and address . 
i have had these adapters for a few weeks now and i can t say much good from them . 
the kids were excited about this product but the lights did not work well . 
the beads would not rinse out and were lodged under my lids . 
my lips got so dry and they looked so gross . 
also ,  due to the design of the rifle ,  i am unable to swap out the front and rear bases . 
even though i get my hair straightened ,  i still use the angel religiously . 
and it did not prevent viewing from the sides . 
what i got works as it is intended for . 
it fit over the top okay ,  though it didn t quite cover the base . 
not worth the purchase and i wish i could get my money back . 
i drink a lot of tea and was looking for something with another flavor to try . 
if you read the ingredients and thought would i eat that ,  the answer would be a resounding no . 
recently ,  however ,  there have been new disposable razors which are just as aesthetically pleasing . 
my pt thinks it might have been correcting me too much too soon . 
it might be worth a try if you can buy it locally and return it easily if needed . 
unless you have a mild infestation of an easy to kill bug ,  don t bother . 
however ,  personally ,  my results cannot testify in favor of this product . 
the squirrels destroy plants and containers and chew through wood trim on the house and get into the attic . 
you can increase your luck but this decreases your lore . 
if i could just lift the lid and push the beans down ,  that would be no problem . 
i should have read the comments as well . 
i had to pull the straps down and wore them tucked under my bra in the sides and back . 
my dog has very hard to deal with skin problems . 
i guess i m probably just sick of playing these ff games . 
i ended up buying frontline plus from another reliable place and it works  great  just like it always did . 
a little smaller than i had hoped for but hey the description said the size . 
the price is awesome but the fit is very awkward . 
this can be used for something else but not for prevent snoring . 
after num_num hours ,  two lights were still charging . 
i gave this case away or else it would ve just collected dust in my drawer . 
furthermore ,  the perfume smells quite different from the scents at the department stores . 
i don t know how well this product works but i can t get passed it s repulsive smell . 
the  ear attachment  and its hinge is made of flimsy loose plastic . 
i got this sandwich grill in a christmas gift exchange and was thrilled at first . 
i did not much care for this product . 
i returned this game after a day ,  and bought slugfest instead . 
the only person in the family it fits is my num_num year old daughter . 
too bad it s so obnoxiously scented !  i m returning it immediately ,  no ifs ,  ands ,  or buts about it . 
i work my tools pretty hard ,  but i almost never blow out a watch in a year . 
wacoal ought to be ashamed putting it s name on something that is so inaffective and flimsy . 
anything heavier than an egg is difficult to turn over because of the flimsiness of the spatula head . 
i have really thick ,  hard to curl ,  dry ,  asian hair . 
i would still have it if petco still made the filters for it . 
it s almost like they put some ground instant powder in the mix to make it stronger . 
i m so frustrated that i wasted my money on num_num lbs of this lousy flour . 
i found these finally and was quite disappointed . 
for a gaming experience that truly screams the mid nineties ,  its the donkey kong country series . 
i had high hopes for this cereal ,  as i am a big peanut fan . 
i took it with me to the hospital but the material is too tough and itchy . 
the palm v is the second palm product that i have owned . 
they have a horrible waxy weird aftertaste that is really bad . 
i wish cobraco the best of luck and hope they can some day live up to my higher expectations . 
num_extend the same as the num_extend of the basic flavor . 
putting small kibble inside presents absolutely no challenge and the ball is emptied in under one minute . 
i bought this product to deter squirrels from moving into my attic . 
after few minutes of charging ,  it felt hot . 
activision should make a new game ,  instead of concentrating on tony hawk this ,  tony hawk that . 
i wanted to take a photo of this to explain that i couldn t complete it . 
what i got is green army guy material . 
these are very light weight compared to my first set . 
very frustrating for both us and my son . 
the texture was good ,  pliable ,  not prickly or crunchy ,  and easy to get chewing . 
for those who want something small ,  this isn t very useful . 
verizon s house brand fit almost over the whole screen with no issues . 
this one is oval shape which makes it harder for the kids to spin on it . 
they are dried out tomthe point they are white on % of the outside . 
she sent us a new  upgraded  drill kit and a gift certificate quicker than i thought possible . 
i ordered this one which was suppose to be a num_num foot model . 
the game tries to be both an rpg and a warcraft style rts . 
would be good for a small child but not an adult . 
it smoothed out nicely with no bubbles on the surface . 
the puppy kong we have is num_num years old and still good . 
if it s as good as wind waker you know i ll buy it . 
since i can connect one gateway desktop though linksys ,  i confirm the network setting is right . 
we d recommend using spikes instead because this product did nothing to keep them out of our yard . 
there is no smell and my cats had zero reaction to this product . 
taste is so so ,  not horrible ,  not great . 
this game is so complicated ,  that its a drag to play . 
the straps were uncomfortable ,  and the band was uncomfortable as well . 
the plastic beads ,  when washed down our drains ,  are polluting our oceans and waterways . 
glad i didn t purchase the larger box as i ve been awake all night . 
when we write on it now ,  the line immediately evaporates so you can t see what you ve traced . 
i ll keep what i have but will not consider ordering cat food again from amazon . 
the reviewers who say this tea has gone downhill in quality must be right . 
this is your only choice ,  should you run out of space in the original drive . 
the car that you drive is too darn hard to drive . 
the high frequencies rattled and sounded tinny like there was a loose connector inside the casing . 
so ,  as of now ,  still have no scrub top and no refund and no answer from ups . 
the max drive will update your cheats quickly . 
i bought this for use with a baby glock and the pistol fit is flawless . 
one of them is methyl paraben combines benzoic acid with the methyl group of chemicals . 
this sunscreen looks ashey on the skin ,  and is very shiny . 
texture is crumbly with a slightly sweet coconut taste . i gave it a low rating because its way over priced . 
it will simply disappear from your bios at ramdom intervals and give you the blue screen of death . 
he had similar reaction to their product and did hydrogen peroxide tests and found them to be rancid . 
i bought this but then went on nutrisystem so i gave up popcorn for num_num months . 
i washed it with dial antibacterial soap ,  and it still smelled awful . 
i am done with the bottle i will order no more . 
this is one hell of a mediocre game . 
the plastic leaves a grainy dust when you tighten the screws ,  which is a lovely feature . 
guess i will use it to season something . 
since greed is apparently the sole motivation they have behind their various decisions and practises . 
the souls of my boots were starting to come off so i used this . 
it doesn t automatically occur to me that even natural foods today are doused with chemicals . 
this also has a fragrance that gives me a slight headache . 
pls help make this company fix this issue by sending proofs in and forcing them to refund . 
the tabs should be a bit sturdier but they are not . 
honestly ,  i would like to see the creators beat their own game . 
the clarity of the glass sucks when focused manually or with a camera body with its own motor . 
the force is excessive from when you first start to depress the key . 
i really didn t think it was worth the money . 
this is especially problematic for a lens that is made for stitching images . 
i have only had great results when using the floor tool . 
i hate to gripe about this purchase as i enjoyed releasing the few ladybugs that i did receive . 
same price ,  same package ,  careless error on my part . 
i m having to ship it back to amazon now in order to get a refund . 
i have extensive experience with networking num_extend years  . 
don t waste your money on the possibility that that the volume control won t fail . 
it is colorful ,  and my daughter does enjoy throwing it ,  but that s obviously not it s intended use . 
he was also able to rip open a hole in the trunk . 
they neither froze nor did they become crunchy . 
not since final fantasy i have i been so frustrated with a game in the series . 
and not just a little warm ,  or a lot warm ,  it s hot . 
point a to b  like someone on here had said  . 
i won t recommed the product to anyone ,  unless they love stalks . 
great box overall but did not get what is pictured . 
it broke easily which defeats the purpose of getting it to protect my phone . 
i ll likely just buy a different harness altogether . 
so please ,  don t waste your money in this item . 
i replaced the factory provided batteries to no avail . 
i noticed my eyes started getting irritated and a rash on my forehead . 
it is definitely the biggest bra i have ever had . 
i think the concept is best if a person has multiple dogs and needs side by side crates . 
i tried a few more times to stomach it ,  but just can t do it . 
so amazon quickly sent a return label and i returned it and ordered another . 
not too long ago i dropped a fat stack and bought the entire line of awapuhi products . 
but ,  no i didn t try it during the day . 
and let s face it ,  it is very possiblr . 
they both begin with  :   filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates  . 
i wish ,  truly wish i liked this stuff . 
this is how i feel when i carb load . 
unfortunately ,  it doesn t have a rubber base so it can slide around when it s in use indoors . 
i wanted to use this for massaging my lower back by laying on it while on my back . 
who can predict what bad things might happen ? other cautions in norelco s documentation :    . 
unfortunately ,  there is a grounding problem with these speakers . 
i really like the radio@aol feature  which is why i purchased it  . 
this device is hard and has no give ,  so your spine adjusts without any cushioning . 
the balloon in the belly popped the second time we played . 
when using the case the color transferred to my hands ,  face and ear . 
warning of the dangers of the harbored digital rights management  drm  subroutine that comes unavoidably bundled with the game . 
just purchased this thing a few hours ago . 
i love lodge products ,  but this doesn t work for me . 
it must be labeled exactly  nunaturals nustevia white stevia pure extract  . 
this mixer died after only a few uses . 
i ll check back in six months ,  if it lasts that long . 
the battery tester function is partially useful for testing alkaline cells . 
for the price there s better toys out there that will keep your baby s attention for longer . 
the the furniture looks like a paper craft project that you punch out of a children s magazine . 
i filed it down to make it fit but then it becomes too weak . 
i would strongly recommend lee consider redesigning this piece of junk or take it off the market . 
dont but it unless you want a headache . 
the reason i purchased this was to use for my symbol num_extend barcode scanner through my usb ports . 
you should fly right through that building ,  not the case with this game . 
the foam isn t attached to the side walls and the foam falls down when you open the case . 
but it all turns out to be boring . 
while it removed some ,  it would not remove the larger ,  harder ones . 
i suspect there might be something in our town s tap water that reacts with the pot . 
you have to hold the pirate down to push the swords in . 
the power speed fly switch up was poorly designed ,  and they do the same thing every time . 
i give the one star due to my money lost . 
not at all soft and flexible like they claim . 
it left my hair heavy feeling and unpleasant smelling . 
i like the flat covers so much ,  i bought extra covers ,  just in case . 
i purchased this headset after the one that came with the xbox broke . 
remove with only one num_num minute application !  no daily application of creams ,  oils or acids . 
i wonder if there are too many veggies in this food ?  cats and dogs are carnivores after all . 
it can t be that hard to make lemon flavor . 
now the handle has a jagged seam with that is off center and sharp . 
if my skin starts looking better without it ,  i will just trash it . 
the pieces fit in awkwardly ,  especially the alphabet one . 
however ,  if you need something extremely light ,  it will work ,  but it will bend easily . 
no sharp edges ,  secure closed doors ,  better gauge wire and a softer  better quality  tray . 
i work with computers and accessories all day ,  i am not intimidated by something different . 
but looking back ,  syphon filter really isn t any good . 
for those that want lte ,  for about $ dollars more i would certainly go with the galaxy sii skyrocket . 
in the beginning ,  these hit the right key every time . 
never received it !  don t have anything to say on this product . 
colors on picture are not as they are on the actual ear cap . 
the case barely shuts; you can drop it on the ground and the contents spill out . 
i wanted to use this cleaner to ensure my friends vcr would be in top shape for the conversion . 
they are not even a heavy duty plastic . it only moves on certain surfaces . 
don t waste the money ,  good graphics or not ,  this game is not entertaining . 
very disappointed in this product !  doesn t do what it promised to do . 
the cars themselves are pretty clunky ,  though they improve somewhat later . 
we later used it to go to the vet ,  and had the exact same thing happen there . 
i did not keep them ,  nor would i recommend them . 
my two stars goes to the absolutley fantastic opening sequence of stunning visuals and graphics . 
when i used it everyday like it says ,  my skin was awful . 
you can do your basic spin attack ,  jumps ,  grabbing onto ledges and floating . 
the second i bought to see if it was a fluke didn t work right out of the box . 
the stem broke on me after three docking attempts . 
i had only been using it for about a minute and it got quite hot . 
not positive results for severe itching ,  or hives . 
how the players can play the same game for a year and a half is beyond me . 
if you have a lot of suede to coat ,  forget this . 
i am a right handed person and the left sided opening is awkward . 
i just don t get the hang of it . 
i m new to air rifles and made hundreds of shots trying to zero in a rifle using these pallets . 
get in it and it drops to within num_num inches of the ground . 
i found the aftertaste of this product very unpalatable . 
by the end ,  several of the seams had problems and the bow fell off . 
so far they have lasted several months with taking extreme good care of them . 
all i got was an error when scanned . 
the fact that the pieces do not slide together or interlock at all really ticks him off . 
oh boy !  of course i might have had a better experience if i had not been laughing so hard . 
if you plan to use yours alot get a better one . 
after listening to all the hype i decided to break down and give it a try . 
the product does not work as it says . 
the stinging takes a couple of hours to subside . 
there are a lot of characters ,  a lot of games ,  and a lot of different things to try . 
i usually love dermablend for it s coverage and staying power . 
i have a wired and wireless networked soho . 
i got a couple of them just because they were priced well . 
the kitchenaid pulse is a failure in actual controlled blending . 
i purchased another one ,  it was comfortable ,  this one had a leak and would deflate in about num_num hours . 
so mine sat at the bottom of the cage and just got pooped on . 
this spotting scope is virtually useless past num_extend
sure the web swinging is well done but they had that down in the last game . 
my problem ?  the top !  i have so many problems getting the primary top to screw into the thermos properly . 
too cheap to bother returning ,  but not useful for me . 
i would rate this a num_num our of num_num in comparison to most drug store brands . 
well ,  to start things off ,  i will list the pros of the game . 
when they arrived their fit was too large all over and i was quite disappointed . 
num_extend num_extend curdle test has been under way on the kitchen counter for num_num hours now . 
my hair looks like i haven t washed it in num_num days . 
they removed the zippered compartments from the interior and they removed the portable padded laptop sleeve too . 
in addition ,  they look like over the ear ,  like scoshe ,  but they are not . 
the ghost was a nice touch though . graphically speaking ,  this was a good game . 
at first ,  this seemed like a good purchase . 
this product did nothing for me at all . 
however ,  be very careful to hold the valve end still . 
sure wish it had worked !  we re trying fox or bobcat urine next . 
my first shock came when i opened the jar . 
num_num for the printer and the last for a router . 
i wanted to see if anyone else was having the same problem . 
if you do buy this camera ,  look for an update to their software if you are running num_extend
my vet recommended these for my num_num girls  one maltese ,  one papillon mix  . 
while quick ,  the auto focus is not very accurate . 
without it ,  i consider there to be no reason to own it . 
it is a standing ,  thinner and perhaps smaller version . 
the game just does not deliver what it should for what a starship combat simulation should . 
next i asked :   where do you have the facility to make it ?   i hear :   ahhh ,  we re in mequon ,  wisconsin  . 
guess what ,  % say that  a  is their choice . 
so ,  you must use the included extension cord ,  which is way too long . 
the green part started peeling off within a week . 
this was an expensive lesson for me ,  but we switched back over to our loved dog food . 
although it looks nice to me it was a waste of money . 
but i ffel the price is a bit on the high side for these items . 
all of the doors fall off every time my daughter plays with it . 
i bought this for working on watches ,  but broke two tools within minutes of using . 
they are very feathered which makes them look thin . 
the players look nothing like the real thing unlike madden for num_extend
the don t have the bridge to so they can t be used as tips . 
my skin was  normal  with no problems before this serum . 
this however is just like scented water . i definitely would not recommend this product . 
this polish doesn t dry great and when you put a top coat over it the design smears . 
over time ,  you want things to get smaller not bigger . 
at the present time this item is of no use to me . 
the smaller crosspoint screwdriver won t engage smaller screws . 
my num_num year old keeps pressing on the puzzle pieces to try to make them work . 
it did not get tangled in my thick ,  past shoulder length hair and it rinses out in a snap . 
i ll try to return it and tell you if i got my money back . 
the track is very delicate and falls over or falls apart constantly . 
i tested my ipod with headphones and it played perfectly ,  my radio played perfectly so it wasn t my speakers . 
this is typical of nokia s products ,  placing a high degree of emphasis on packaging . 
i did just use a cnd shellac color this last time . 
and his parents so i think maybe that s the problem . 
it really did nothing at all for me . 
cars have a very hard time to stay on the track . 
i have had to tape piececs together and she still manages to escape . 
its very bright ,  i will say that much . 
i ve had my infrashine flat iron for over num_num years . 
the  jumbo  size did not match our  xlarge  litter box ,  despite the  equal  dimensions . 
one of the poorest excuses of a sport i have ever seen . 
this is a very comfortable headset and was quite easy to set up with my motorola phone . 
i have the treats in it and all and she doesnt even roll it around . 
but the iphone app just hangs and doesn t sync to my account ,  even after a reinstall . 
you have to complete num_num off the wall ,  ridiculously hard tasks just to get one weapon ,  or one inventor . 
i dropped it on the ground once and it shaddered . 
oh yeah ,  and i got a serious sore thumb from holding the joystick in the same direction . 
she had it all over the floor around her , and all over her paws . 
i only received the red num_num grit ,  and blue num_num grit stones . 
first ,  i would have never bought these simply due to their cost alone . 
spend money on those ,  this i absolutely do not recommend . 
once the black writing wears off of these there is no way to tell the measurements . 
this would be a great product of the wires to the ear buds were more durable . 
was very disappointed as was hoping this would be a good solution to my girls . 
very cheap material and gets dark and dirty quicklu . 
it s too expensive to feed it to the feral cats all the time . 
it was on her face ,  eyes and mouth . 
but when i rinsed and got out of the shower ,  i knew something was wrong . 
it is not included and i wish we hadn t bought it . 
the xbox num_num is a very good gaming system ,  but however . 
the handle is all metal and not very rough so it is very easy to drop this . 
i guess i m not having that much luck with bluetooth earpieces . 
and crashed again after trying to launch explorer . 
and was told they would need tocall me back . 
its is in many makeups and its slowly being taken out of the products we use . 
the new covers are made out of the cheapest plastic possible . 
pieces always stay inside and it gets funky if you don t find a way to get them out . 
the inner case is very hard to the point that it could damage your phone . 
you have to remove the cradle ,  and the antenna for this to fit well . 
i can t say anything good about it and i don t recommend this game . 
in terms of performance wen is still better . 
the toy projects light ,  and the stars are just shadows ,  not the other way around . 
i would not recommend this if you are easily frustrated . 
multiplayer on these maps is much ,  much ,  more fun . 
that product is rubbed on ,  and has a bronzer so that you can see where it s being applied . 
the frame rates have also taken a beating . 
it may work on dogs with less serious problems than mine . 
a direct line recording from my line out would be stuttered and useless . 
i tried on an extra small  no way  and then a small at a local store . 
i was going to buy another one but this one seemed fun . 
the item did fit the phone very well ,  but didn t offer the increased handling confidence i was looking for . 
i tried charging my htc evo num_extend lte with this charger . 
well right away i had a ninja running at me slashing me to bits . 
i bought these blocks because i wanted to use them for some maternity photos . 
sorry ,  im just telling you how it is . 
in early career mode ,  most of the more interesting races ,  tracts ,  and cars are locked out . 
i don t know what is going on here . 
it held up for a couple of days before it started to pull off the screen . 
i had to re wash my hair after using this . 
for some reason ,  i thought this was going to taste more like coconut milk . 
anyways ,  now he doesn t play with it at all . 
i ordered one of these a few years ago  four ?   . 
threw it in the garbage ,  and immediately ordered a different case . 
these are only num_num billion which is nothing . 
nomenclature and printing on battery not as represented in photo . 
i wear size num_num but it clearly is too big for me . 
out of all ,  this was generally total dissatisfaction ,  however ,  the product is a good one . 
though neither is something we d want to purchase ,  kiwi berry was the least desirable of the two . 
the fat burner pills are fairly large and a pain in the $ sometimes to choke them down . 
the length of the cord is also shorter than the original adapter and it heats up considerably . 
we thought this product would solve the fried vs . 
games like boiling point ,  gothic num_num  best game ever  and morrowind ,  are . 
in num_num months it was eating batteries in num_num minutes . 
i bought it for my surefire num_extend defender ,  hoping i could molle it to my num_extend vest . 
this was the first ever highlighting kit i have ever used . 
and this time even the coconut oil isn t cutting it . 
i don t know how these work on hard water stains . 
that s num_num to num_num months of operation according to my experience . 
the little fluval is doing all the work . 
the fabric doesn t have the same stretch as the one i got last year . 
well the foundation doesn t stay and it doesn t cover well . 
would have gave a num_num for a speedy delivery ,  but my  bulk package  came defected . 
just find a brand who s flavor you like . 
however this product does not fit our droid num_num phones . 
i had a question and contacted moroccanoil directly . 
i have an iphone num_num and thought i would give this a try . 
i had this machine for about num_num weeks . 
i was so disappointed ,  i threw away num_num packs . 
i replaced it with a bigger one that is more durable and less expensive . 
i happened upon it at a small town pickle factory . 
we bought this before talking to our vet ,  the side effects just weren t worth it . 
during winter ,  mice invade our barn and basement looking for food and warmth . 
i think they would work if your puppy is already pad trained . 
i recently used the num_extend model charger on vacation and it worked !  !  hope that this helps .     . 
this is a cute toy and our daughter loved it but . 
check the dimensions also ,  much larger than i thought . 
the handle is one piece ,  and there is no way to modify it . 
at only num_num miles from a few broadcast stations ,  i expected this antenna would be functional . 
if you can swallow smooth sweet tasting mud ,  be my guest otherwise stay away from this . 
in all fairness my husband is also super picky about his shoes as far as comfort goes . 
if you want a cereal that has lots of fiber and protein ,  and will keep you full for hours . 
i ve been using it for about num_num months now and am no longer pleased . 
it can  go out of control  and spin the rotors uncontrollably . 
for the price ,  yeah it s some cheap plastic . 
i had the original several years ago and they were fantastic . 
told you why mega man num_extend is so freakin  awful . 
the case itself looks great  aside from the giant incipio logo which is a bit of a turnoff  . 
worst of all though ,  the motor has lost its umph . 
no matter how many times i tried to introduce the product s  to him . 
i spent some time researching these  not enough to offset the savings vs . 
this stuff is just not as thick an smooth as gillette s series of gels . 
when i saw his knife i told him he probably should get something made better . 
but please ,  please save your trouble and stay away from this game . 
was poorly made and didn t fit the phone . 
by the time i received the product ,  it was no longer needed . 
but i could not recommend it because of the poor quality . 
the software occasionally dropped out and the unit had to be restarted but after that it worked . 
this is a cute product ,  but does not fit around the phone properly . 
then ,  it very suddenly started lasting less than a day . 
i think the thorlo brand is vastly overrated . 
the silicone housing is just not very well fitted . 
the material obviously had to be made from chemicals . 
but it is no better than the attachments that allow trimming . 
i saw so many good reviews for this i had to try it . 
with drivers misssing ,  drivers being misplaced ,  electrical failures . 
they started falling apart after a week too . 
the clamp fits different size frame tubing by using the provided plastic sleeves . 
barely picks up much before you have to empty it or it loses suction . 
probably because it s a little bit loose . others might get a better connection . 
way to small if you like to take a lot of things . 
if you want a num_extend camera look at the olympus stylus num_extend and the konica minolta dimage num_extend
i purchased this because i have broken capallaries in my cheeks from sun damage . 
sick ! the photo software that this num_num comes with is useless . 
i prefered the card games in ff viii and ix . 
it is nothing more then a night cream . 
i don t know how to describe it really . 
on the positive side ,  this game is seriously beautiful . 
they were great product did not preform to me . 
i wish i could return mine and get my money back . 
after watching a friend play this game and playing a little myself ,  it looked sweet . 
i ll update this if the tool was the problem . 
the little marks between each num_num pounds are impossible for me to read even with my reading classes . 
this is really not my kind of deodorant . 
you have no real control over your party .  .  . everything is automated . 
i will keep hoping for an all natural asthma solution that works great . 
the included usb cable is only for synchronization ,  not charging . 
i tried this self tanner about a year ago and had a horrible experience . 
i contacted boost case help ,  but they never replied . 
incorrect ,  only stated it was an outdoor product . 
last night ,  it had been running for num_num hours ,  at num_num am . 
por fin ,  la mejor version de num_extend acaba de salir . 
i have sent them no less than num_num emails over the last num_num months . 
i ended up having to take the whole phone apart and bend the pin back into place . 
but if you are looking for a game to entertain you .  .  . pick something else . 
unfortunately ,  i now have a case of this bland stuff . 
usable only on jeans or some heavy denim . 
we were so excited to give this to our son . 
i don t know if it s the product or the user ,  but this won t hold my lashes on . 
with fandango ,  gameplay seems to be a less important means towards creative and hilarious ends . 
i also like the num_num person memory ,  quick fit cuff ,  and cuff storage . 
very serious issue is the left over wax . 
i am able to get online with the wii using this device ,  but it is very touchy . 
this de boles pasta has a really weird aftertaste . 
this is a beautiful watch ,  but no matter how i latch it ,  it won t stay on . 
if you are expecting commercial quality ,  and most powerful electric meat grinder ,  go with tasin . 
i have not seen my daughter even give it a sideways glance since chirstmas morning . 
i purchased this splitter so my wife and i could watch movies on my tablet during our recent flight . 
in reading the reviews ,  it seems this is more common than it should be . 
needs to be more protective and more sturdy . 
now i have to check on it periodically to make sure it is connected . 
my experience is the buzz just adds to the noise . i ve tried to give the headphones away twice . 
i like his friendship where he throws his hat like a frisbee . 
sony headphones are notorious for the ear pads falling apart . 
the controller is very difficult to master or sometimes does not do what it is suppose to . 
this toy was a great find or so i thought . 
i used it once and threw it out .  .  . it absolutely reeks . 
i ll probably end up donating it to the thrift store . 
i was so happy with the first num_extend that after num_num months i lost it so i bought another . 
i actually found the play at times fun ,  but the game crashed num_extend out of num_num games . 
those are about the only good points about this cleaner . 
these were great at first purchase ,  but they did not hold up very well . 
the computer would detect the camera and download the pix like it s supposed to . 
the bite valve is and still remains a mystery to me . 
if this were a computer product it would be worthwhile . 
it had no effect on frisky ,  a six month old rescued feral . 
i usually love these cheese and peanut butter crackers ,  but these are probably the worst i ve ever had . 
it actually smelled good like chicken and had lots of gravy which i thought they would go for . 
they were too long and ,  again not wide enough . 
i am two years and $ into tic products ,  and i have nothing left that works . 
i am a dude and i bought these for my wife because she needed one . 
too bad they go so heavy on the fragrance . 
this was a great toy ,  for the first num_num minutes . 
xenosaga is not a true rpg ,  nor is pretty much any console game out there . 
it is useless until i can buy screws from a hardware store . 
this cream soda for the sodastream is absolutely terrible . 
the rebel wireless remote is not a good device . 
i bought this to use as a diuretic ,  didn t really work . 
the wood on some has broken or splintered away . 
it only worked for a month then it would charge my phone anymore . 
for me over all just to much bean of a flavor and i will never by it again . 
i wish i could have returned this box for a refund . 
these ,  in turn ,  are composed of  fatty acids .   these fatty acids fall into three categories :  saturated ,  monounsaturated and polyunsaturated . 
i had already purchased a bra just like this one in a popular high end clothing store . 
i don t want to take the back off my phone to place it in a case . 
she munched on the softest one and ate some of it and it gave her a tummy ache . 
the slightly high price tag would have been worth it if this product had lived up to its hype . 
to end it all ,  the ending was just . 
i have bought flight sim num_extend num_num pro ,  and now num_num pro . 
i would raise the rating a notch or two if it allowed me to . 
i unpacked one of them ,  read the instructions and immediately filled out the return request for amazon . 
i can t get enough power to charge it when it is plugged in to my netbook or laptop . 
so ,  i have it here somewhere for me to look at occasionally  :   . 
the color is exactly what i was looking for ,  but the consistency is no good . 
for me this bay rum shave puck was very ,  very dry . 
room around the eyes so its not pressing against the eyelids . 
it might be low acid ,  but it seems that any acid at all is too much for some people . 
i guess by most of the meat being too soft and  mushy  ,  it lost all its flavor . 
whatever . another main ingredient of this game was its puzzles ,  i suppose . 
but that s about it ,  num_extend stars out of num_extend
sounds just as good ,  still in one piece . 
this filter works ,  but comes at a cost of disadvantages to other similarly priced filters . 
i opened the container and instead for a fine powder it had clots probably due to the heat . 
the next time around ,  i ll make sure i thoroughly research the game before i buy it . 
i wish i could understand why stupid men have to have enormous arm holes . 
he said he d had other reports of the product causing problems or simply not working . 
even with a brand new filter ,  the water tasted very bad . 
this template was hard to get all the color off in the correct shape . 
however ,  later on in the game the game starts placing num_num laws in effect all at once . 
this stated that it was for knee and patella support . 
they give you this false image of how beautiful you ll look when you use it . 
until the open road design i just got and had to send back . 
in this price range i m just asking for useable optics ,  so i m not expecting a leica for twenty bucks . 
i don t understand all the hype about this product . 
in other words ,  the juice can charge at most two devices :  a notebook ,  plus one other small gadget . 
note :  amazon requires vine reviews to be posted within num_num days of receiving the product . 
i immediately went into the main game and went to play . 
it will not work as a shine spray ,  or frizz remover ,  etc . 
being a trainer ,  i had to try it . 
give the price of the nook to a local charity . 
because the plastic is hard ,  it scratches the top of his nose . 
why didn t they use hinges so the legs could fold . 
there are only two possible user names :  admin and user ,  a potential security flaw . 
i would have rather paid much more and got something that could last . 
they always come off as soon as i walk in them . 
i originally used a thin nail ,  but wanted something a little easier and faster to get the job done . 
 not much effort was taken to do so  . 
to make matters worse ,  they re not even accurate among themselves . 
 there was lots of reading ,  much too much ,  in the game . 
have not seen it make a difference in my skin color . 
it came out in too small of pieces anyway . 
i am num_extend and ordered a medium length and these fit halfway over my feet !  waaaay too long . 
let me first say that this is not the vacuum that i selected and ordered from the amazon site . 
again though ,  i wouldn t use them to filter out a model entirely . 
the old developed some cracks after several years . 
the game simply doesn t live up to it s prequel . 
i have a daycare and over think it is a waste of money . 
when my son was going through his construction phase ,  i purchased this . 
i could see how to beat every battle ,  if only the ai would cooperate . 
i first thought i d try using my workout glovesvaleo ocelot wrist wrap lifting gloves . 
i washed my hair num_extend times and it still smelled like it . 
however ,  he has replaced his also within the last year . i bought this ball around christmas num_extend
glad amazon has a great baby item return policy . 
i ll also reconsider when it comes time to upgrade whether to buy another motorola product . 
i won t buy a cheap bino online any more . 
so ,  atleast this was not for my num_extend
once i started using only made in usa products the issues went away . 
i first bought a norelco back in the num_extend and it was the best ever . 
you alternate segments between a young retarded lad named billy and his grisled ,  bloodthirsty yet also retarded preacher uncle . 
i spent a ton of time trying to figure out why it wouldn t resolve an ip address . 
in austin ,  not which isn t an especially large city ,  there is not one frequency with absolutely nothing on it . 
within a minute water entered the canister through spider cracks in the base . 
maybe the extruder hadn t been rinsed well .  .  ?  preservative ?  probably would have been tasty otherwise . 
i m always looking for new snacks to spoil my mini dachshund ,  so i bought these at petsmart yesterday . 
our dog is well behaved ,  but has the worst case of separation anxiety . 
i wasted my money on both cb radio and the antenna plus the adapter . 
after num_num or so minutes of work ,  i finally got a barely usable edge . 
your goal is to chain colors together and drop the breaker block to set the chain off . 
i listen to about num_num gig of music daily so throw away another $ for a memory stick . 
the battles are full of little phrases that ,  after a while ,  will drive you crazy . 
the holes are too small for the majority of the pegs . 
she s still not too happy with the usability of the motorola num_extend
my little one is almost num_num now and has had it for num_extend years . 
i received the pair of these goggles i ordered this morning . 
my network is hardwired and i use linksys routers . 
i guess i got spoiled on gin gins . 
well i am sorely disappointed after reading all the reviews about this machine . 
i only paid $ for the num_num oz . 
too large around the ankles and a little snug along the calves . 
hot enough to curl other lashes i m sure . 
i couldnt even leave town untill i found everyone and it was a pain to play . 
it s inexpensive but just a bit too cheap . 
i don t have this game ,  i only played it at a few stores . 
that s the one that killed my love for constant comment . 
so i do have a clue as to how to manage a litter box . 
they leave globs of hair on my chairs . 
ea killed this game with really bad drm . 
what i received could never be described as sturdy . 
after several weeks of using this product ,  i actually can say it made my skin look worse . 
in comparison ,  the kong toys are mighty strong . 
toast wasn t a golden tan as i had anticipated ,  but brown around the edges ,  white in the center . 
the gba codes worked better than they did with my old ar ,  but i was still disappointed . 
i wouldn t put it on my skin and ,  as a skin care professional ,  i say not worth it . 
the movies are ok ,  but the game play is boring ,  and most of the jokes are really corny . 
i got this for one of my cats who had mild buildup on his top teeth . 
plus they are too loose for a straight fit . 
i have had it less than a week and it is already broken . 
i have a little gut ,  but not so much that i have this problem with pants regularly . 
i just hope the other games coming out are not just num_extend ports . 
my opinion is that the kimber slide release is far superior to the wilson combat product . 
save your money and buy a new irrigator . 
i bought this pan to make sandwich buns from yeast dough . 
i was skeptical because i read some not so great reviews . 
the plastic is very thin and it gets punctured too easily . 
it comes with a plate that fits the evo battery its some generic charger . 
i was num_num days over the return policy . 
i had to go back and shampoo this product off him . 
i can clean it ,  and it doesn t roll away like the iq ball into places my dog cannot reach . 
until i researched the ingredients and made the switch . 
this is the worst ff game i ve ever played ,  taking the title away from num_extend
these pens will write just fine on disks that don t have an unlabeled ,  mirror finish . 
the pc version of bioshock is the most drm d game ever released ,  no joke . 
it s similar putting on vasaline on your lips . 
it is only held in by one magnet . 
i bought this on seeing num_extend star  rating in amazon . com . 
i bought this thinking it was something else . 
enough so ,  that we are returning the toys . 
i found it to be absolutely ,  positively ,  useless . 
these are made of very low quality materials ,  but given the price ,  there is no shock here . 
they re much thinner ,  set up faster and provide a nice canvas for makeup . 
android malware continues to crop up regularly ,  with a new one just found today that bricks your phone . 
my pups won t bother with this no matter how many of their favorite treats i put into it . 
the quests are enough to keep you occupied for some time ,  and varied enough to avoid boring you . 
i am sure that it will last forever ,  but i don t like the toughness of it . 
also ,  to avoid this issue ,  the strainer must hold less than a cup of liquids . 
so expensive and the quality is very poor . 
in addition ,  the transformer ,  that plugs in the electrical outlet ,  gets way to hot . 
was able to get the smaller one on ,  but could barely get the larger up past hips . 
it looked horrible !  and nothing like how it looked on the blonde woman s lips . 
they make a much better and safer product . 
i think the extra $ or so i spent for belkin are worth it . 
btw ,  the vendor who depicts one item and sends another is redrock distributing . 
this is a bit too much work to get the olive oil out to spray . 
this has gone on for num_extend minutes while wasting the num_num aa batteries inside . 
after two months it wouldn t play dvds longer than maybe num_num minutes . 
now imagine walking through your house with ten pounds of grotesque filth in a trash bag . 
there are some levels where you switch between the two ,  one defending the other or completing different tasks . 
it looked very nice visually in the screenshots released . 
i opened two bars to be sure ,  and passed one to my coworker to smell . 
while it is christmas ,  and my son did get a brand new crayola glow dome ,  it s not really exciting . 
i personally believe this is a useless and cheap product . 
we are not all the same size and shape . 
they are also much smaller than the originals . 
this is horrible ,  it can t tell the difference between the dog barking and someone laughing . 
it lasted throughout half the night before it wore off . 
don t lose money and time with this game . 
the game looks stunning for what it is . 
my phone is a num_extend and not a . 
i had high hopes for this unit given what we paid for it ,  but have had many problems . 
a poor expenditure ,  but too much bother to return . 
but this expensive kitchenaid is out of warranty . 
another said that it was great ,  they peeled a bushel of apples quickly . 
this toy was more trouble than it was worth trying to play with . 
i must have done something wrong because this was a disaster . 
this game is about ww num_num in the pacific as the title indicates . 
i had to force myself to stay interested and keep going . 
that is because the finish will deteriorate and allow food to stick . 
i tried that instead of this dish and my dog hasn t had any more problems with eating too fast . 
we feed halo dry and our adult male cat stopped vomiting . 
this is something many similar games boast of but don t really deliver on . 
there are far better ways to combat oil than this product out there . 
i tried cerave facial lotion am ,  because i love cerave facial lotion pm ,  and cerave moisturizing cleanser . 
i immediately started emergency water changes and filtration . 
as soon as i put them on ,  the liner slipped and started to curl in . 
where i got them from seemed to play role . 
i have tried to put tape but obviously it does not work . 
arrived on time ,  well packaged . i ordered tops and bottoms . 
i felt like i was going to pull my hair out . 
the case is handmade so there is some glue left around the case . 
after cleaning it up with a small wire brush voltage tested at num_extend that s only a % charge . 
i do not know what i do not understand about buying pants but these fit so weird . 
she had pretty good results ,  sorry i can t say the same . 
my eyeshadow doesn t go on very well when i put it on over it . 
i did not try this long enough to be able to state whether it works or not . 
hard to get off clean better put it where you want it the first time . 
to be fair ,  most products don t work on me . 
it seemed older than all the orders of this item . 
world wide distributors says it s samsungs problem ,  since their num_num day warranty its expired and i m sol . 
this horrible ,  horrible  my opinion of course !   concealer . i am num_num and tend to look younger for my age . 
this does not lightening ,  even skin tone or anything . 
the graphics are poor and movement is archaic . 
goes on nice ,  but didn t see any rejuvination . 
it never used to . i have stopped buying this brand completely now . 
i purchased this and found it to be a waste of money . 
maybe that s the problem ?  at any rate ,  it isn t working for him . 
once i returned it ,  i went to   .  .  .   and just sent it to them to replace . 
i really like how powerful this phone is . 
i suffered for about a half hour and tossed them into the trash . 
one of the most common tricks with dog food :  ingredient splitting so you can put meat products up front . 
it has a whang to it that is nasty . 
it s much sturdier than the nyx blush ,  and there s a lot of product ,  plus a small mirror . 
rule of thumb is to move the decimal point over num_num spaces and add a $ dollar sign . 
well unfortunately ,  it didnt really do much for me . 
to sweep half of it up after each play session just makes me cringe . 
since the item was outside of amazon s exchange timeframe ,  i went to kensington and got a replacement . 
that is a stupid mistake from engineer who design this bluetooth . 
otherwise ,  if you don t like to spend money wisely ,  this sp is for you . 
and the pictures of the meat and water bucket . 
the calories are very high and the product does not taste good . 
the mein changes in the character creattion screen are ,  in fact ,  not  implemented yet  or ever . 
let me just tell you to install the disc ,  plug in the controller and wait . 
these are the cheapest and thinnest  non balls  i have ever seen . 
they in fact did very little ,  if anything at all . 
don t buy this ,  you ll only wind up doing your nails all over again . 
it was used for about num_num minutes and then discarded . 
usually oxo products are fairly tough and durable ,  but not this one . 
this didn t work for me ,  or i used it wrong . 
i may try the real flaxseed oil or granules and see if i benefit from it . 
i thought i d like this tea but unfortunately ,  i was mistaken . 
i am afraid this product will dry out before i use it all . 
a great price would be $ and that would be what a usb cable is worth . 
the one problem that could of been avoided easily . 
it has a big brush and when putting it on i saw flakes fall . 
i still can t understand why not ,  but trust me because of this you will get annoyed . 
and this is from someone who likes tofu . 
i think it is among the finest in the world . 
but when i tried a bite i couldn t believe how unpleasant it was . 
the cheap material of the rubber seems very inferior and would not last very long . 
i don t think it was worth the money . 
my num_extend hardware version is as buggy as many others have noted ,  especially with wep enabled . 
memeory cards will become more and more versatile into the future and soon be used in countless devices . 
something to which i never quite got accustomed . 
so i am about to toss this food in the garbage ,  and i hate to waste food . 
i wonder how many countless gigabytes of data have been lost ?   . 
dog hated it and i dont thin it really worked . 
i ve tried many other walden farms products and have liked several of them . 
i bought two of these soups and was disappointed in them . 
then after a few days ,  the white started getting dark and dingy looking . 
his  tickle spots  are buttons that really you have to push pretty good if you are a little kid . 
the radio did not pick up many stations and was hard to tune . 
given all the above ,  back it goes to amazon . 
the image shows a packaged screen protector with cleaning cloth . 
i had enough at this point and chose to clean it to ship back . 
after six months this particular soft rubber plastic begins to loosen . 
evidentially they have no ability to call people back . 
i dropped my phone and got a crack in the glass . 
the num_num lame moves don t even look real either . 
purchased from a local sony shop ,  christmas ,  num_extend
i must say that the grayish metal color didn t come off during my meringue ,  it was nice and white . 
it seems to move backwards fine ,  but going forwards is a different story . 
if you really try to do anything without grasping it with two hands ,  it will come off the fridge . 
they need to come up with a better design . 
these harbinger bars are overly lightweight ,  poorly manufactured and unstable . 
this had a rubbery feel and grip to the screen that i didn t like . 
the hardwre is not sized correctly for the unit and the shaft is wearing out . 
however ,  the teeth bend very easily ,  leaving a gap between the scoops ,  which makes picking up poop a challenge . 
they ve got really friendly customer service ,  but no one available could provide me with that information . 
shine this will give you ,  not so sure i like the smell though . 
healthy shouldn t have to taste like wartime rations ,  not in this day and age . 
after the batteries were in place i found it to be almost impossible to replace the plastic plug . 
the sea salt flavor is nice ,  delicate ,  easy to eat . 
but this batch doesn t want to melt into hot water or coffee . 
the rail attachment is too small for the flashlight . 
however ,  they tend to slip out ,  and are uncomfortable . 
that being said ,  the cats were okay with it . 
this thing actually performed worse than the antenna that came with the wireless card . 
i ordered this item from amazon . com in the expectation that it would arrive promptly and in good shape . 
apparently due to enviromental concerns the previous generation used a different battery that lasted forever . 
i sized up to a num_extend hoping the width would suffice ,  but alas that was not the case . 
the screws on the top are are bright and shiny ,  no attempt to camouflage them . 
i bought them for a fifth wheel landing gear pad and they are slippery and small . 
maybe a little longer then like a gulf pencil . 
and a couple of bruder ones which haven t even faded ,  tho one did break a small part . 
it was a depressing ending to a strange game . 
fine on speaker phone . i called the jawbone people and they said to fax them my receipt . 
finally i called the company cap barbell ,  noone answers the phone ever . 
instead ,  trash the installation cd rom and download sonicstage num_extend from sony s web site  connect . com  . 
my dog would not walk in this no matter what we tried . 
boo boo boo at kidkraft for making an easel like this !  !  !  . 
the blue starts with fish ,  then goes down to better choices like peas and oatmeal . 
then i tried it on gravel it only caused a mess without sucking in anything . 
i love the idea ,  and when it s functioning it s fantastic . 
since i didn t buy them from amazon ,  returning them will be a real nuisance . 
what the heck ?  after about a week the replacement blade was dull . 
i already knew what i was going to be told . 
and  not effective  in rural areas where deer density is high ,  and damage is extreme and frequent . 
i m going back to jergens daily glow to get my tan on . 
well the motorola photon would not charge when connected . 
i bought this because it was recommend as a best buy in a consumer reports magazine . 
i tried this pen out and ended up returning it . 
most annoying is the button on the front is so sensitive it constantly pocket calls people . 
i think the time it broke was maybe the third time i changed the airline . 
and this stand need to use the bottom bracket to hold the bike in place . 
this plush was for some reason  over stuffed  her mom took out a little stuffing as we played on . 
therefore i am digging the end out of the toy . 
and quite frankly ,  caesar ii was more fun . 
the game won t let you escape an area without killing ,  so there goes the stealth aspect . 
i feel like there is a disco going on when they are in use . 
they may have actually updated the photo now .  i use msm to clear up acne marks . 
he still will attack my other cat any chance he gets and we need to keep them separated . 
the one moving part on the unit and it was faulty . 
finally ,  she tells me to contact the manufacturer of my phone  samsung  for troubleshooting assistance . 
worked great for the first month and num_num days  we bought two ,  btw  . 
at least on my tub ,  it won t work . 
this was my third or fourth item to put a protective screen on . 
i have played many adventure games and scratches has to be one of the most boring ever . 
the cream is more oil based ,  which does not work well with anyone who has problems with oily skin . 
i have to take the case off to charge my phone !  . 
getting the two different colors is a nice touch and they feel solidly constructed . 
the plastic is so flimsy i ve had packaging made of thicker stuff . 
it s poison !  !  no wonder i was feeling awful . 
whenever i tell people i got a shock collar for my dog ,  some of them become livid . 
i recommend using something like pure shea butter to even skin instead of this . 
i swear im not buying this flavor again ,  nor would i recommend it . 
i had a tough time with the smell of this . 
there is little resemblance to the original game . 
i had looked forward to this game for months . 
but i will thank them for giving us three weapon choices  telescope stick ,  and the maul to name two  . 
june bride ,  vegas nights and water field have plenty of glitter but not this one . 
i figured i would give this one a shot . 
omg !  !  !  they stuck together !  !  !  the floats now look bad !  the coating has come away ,  after pulling them apart . 
in theory ,  this is a great zooble collection case . 
oh yeah ,  there this sunday drive thing which is picking and dropping people off with no time limit . 
it leaves my hair stiff and tangled after rinsing . 
we have a num_num year old mixed breed dog who weighs about num_num pounds on good days . 
i needed a detangler ,  but this stuff was completely useless on my hair . 
the though of an num_extend camera was great since i utilize num_extend and g within my house . 
if i d had to use this when i had my kids . 
pour psyllium fiber into a glass and let it sit for five minutes . 
i could never go to the menu when my remotes stopped working . 
after trying this one ,  however ,  i m not sure i ll be buying any of the others . 
it is not even the same model number as this sale page indicates . 
i remember these from when i was a kid . 
in this case it s definitely you get what you pay for . out of the shipping box the powder was everywhere . 
save your money and do your part by living sustainably . 
monster may be a great company with other products ,  but this product was a flop . 
it might be better mix in a muffin batter or tossed in some oatmeal ,  but i didn t even try . 
my acne did go down a little ,  but the bumps of the new and old were still there . 
this is a fantastic app and i don t use my golauncher screen much any more . also ,  there s one physical button . 
the eyeliner liquid itself is watery ,  translucent ,  and the tip is not sturdy enough for my liking . 
the controls are clunky and shooting is jerky and unresponsive . 
ky yours and mine ,  imho ,  has too much unnecessary junk in it . 
however most of my cake recipiets say to use spray .  .  . then i stuck . 
the texture is not as smooth as their competitor . 
if you want a mechanical buy an orient diver ,  is a lot better than this seiko diver . 
i paid $ for socks that after once a week wear over num_num months developed holes in both heels . 
through vine this was my opportunity . for me there were some problems . 
flavor only lasts a couple of minutes; much less than the other flavors . 
because it is removable ,  it will sometimes fall off during use . 
this is supposed to be a good action rpg game . 
like the gap between the iphone and the case has oil in it . 
neither of my puppies really liked this flavor of treat . 
after each use ,  it is a bit red ,  but it doesn t last long . 
i have returned this and ordered the speck case . 
this is particularly unfortunate because belkin usually turns out good products . 
order came on time ,  shoe size that wassent was w wide  instead of m  medium  . 
i have about num_num title in my database . i have loaded all of the software and firmware updates released . 
it is very coarse ,  which i do not like for face . 
i have used a droid razr ,  droid razr maxx and now the num_extend
ultimately ,  after num_num months of attempts , this brush found itself in the trash . 
although my phone did feel like a tank inside this beast of a case ,  it just wasn t for me . 
i chose this due to its color and pricing . 
i don t like my lashes to look thick and coated and this stuff does that . 
i was so excited about this product based on all the fabulous reviews . 
and will likely add better products than this kit provides . 
initially ,  i tried to vacuum this up with an old eureka vacuum  my  downstairs  vacuum  . 
weird after taste and the smell is awful . 
after about num_num uses the charger shorted out and ruined a battery . 
in other words ,  there are less expensive supplements like this on the market . 
i loved this product when i first used it . 
 i always empty all my food products into glass containers for storage  . 
these made me extremely thirsty and i just didn t care for the taste at all . 
to a proper temperature in num_num minutes as it said . 
this product would be rated at least a four if it didn t break so quickly . 
i m not saying it wouldn t work for someone else but it didn t work for me . 
and the choice of books and apps is poor compared to kindle . 
two words :  it sucks !  !  i sold mine on ebay and got some money back . 
num_num do not stop beeping and keep spraying . 
unfortunately ,  i found them very difficult to put on his feet . 
would not recommend this product for experienced makeup artists . 
i will probably not spend this much money on a coffee pot with such a sad decline . 
i have installed several screen protectors previously and never was advised to wait an . 
so that kind of stunk but oh well . 
have to admit i have oily ,  older skin  hey ,  it s in good shape  . 
took it to a sprint store and they couldn t get one on well either . 
oh well ,  nothing ventured ,  nothing gained ,  but i would not recommend this product !  . 
i have two large labs and keeping their yard ready for play has never been easier . 
honestly ,  the dora cartoon is one of my least favorites . 
maybe you could use for a sandwich in a backpack . 
it is no longer the bargain it used to be . 
i ordered this screen for my phone because mine was badly cracked . 
buyer beware !  the picture shows num_num figurines ,  all different except the hair color . 
the sonix case fits the ipod num_extend perfectly; snaps on securely ,  all ports are easily accessible ,  nice snug fit . 
this happened a lot when i had to repeat whole battles over and over . 
the case i recieved was not this color displayed . 
i simply threw this one away instead of returning it . 
it way squeezing my stomach ,  ribs ,  and back horribly . 
the type of filter it uses is another irritation . 
i m not at all impressed with this product and don t recommend it . 
if you just want taste though ,  then you ll be pleased . 
i m thinking it would probably be better for someone much younger . 
i asked for a supervisor ,  and was of course ,  somehow was disconnected . 
this looks soft in the picture ,  but i found it to be heavy ,  stiff and crackly . 
it is suppose to be a privacy screen for your phone but it s kind of a pain . 
has a lot of small parts so becareful if you have small toddlers . 
my teeth did not feel any cleaner than with a normal toothbrush . 
i could not note any significant difference between flavors . 
this item is cheaply priced ,  therefore the quality of this case is also cheap . 
when this pan was new it was a work of art . 
if you are a casual rider ,  looking for a little added support ,  these may be fine . 
it s just too fragile and not even much fun . 
but it didn t work for me at all . 
my back side was already beginning to get a little sore . 
you just stick to driving around in cars . 
i have bad candida ,  to the point where i can see yeast in my bowel movements . 
the only difference between the two is the tractor supply baffle is a solid gray instead of clear . 
i tried the discs in  another  player and they worked fine . 
they are very heavy chewers and nothing lasts very long . 
this isn t like other cuisinart products i ve owned . 
i ended up donating mine to goodwill after a week of failed attempts at styles . 
mailed in a timely manner the other parts matched the cell only num_num of the num_num did not fit . 
they ve really gone overboard this time ,  and the game is going back immediately . 
i will ,  however ,  state that bloodlines is a far better game than this . 
they stretchout when you try to peel away the paper ,  even when following their owndirections exactly . 
the thumb press broke  it s plastic  after light use . 
the nutritional profile of the brown rice isn t even that great . 
it wasn t delivered until november !  thank goodness it s so cheap or i d be really angry . 
our family did a little taste test of three brands  we hope to do more in the future ,  lol  . 
i faxed it five num_extend times and they didn t get it . 
my son went through num_num pairs in a month . 
they had no or limited ability to help me . 
she seems to want to go meet the new dog before i get there . 
i made the mistake of just glancing over the reviews . 
finally after num_num hours i threw the instructions on the floor and came out to write this . 
however ,  the texture is too soft to make it through shipping . 
you must spend something like num_num hours to beat it without a walkthrough . 
i was hoping to use it to clean gunk after i do a cleaning of the tank . 
they determined the handle was malfunctioning and sent out a new one . 
this happened on more than one occassion and was extremely frustrating . 
i just bought two more and they are not at all the same pant . 
in my opinion the skin care business is a complete racket . 
i m not talking about iheart or another streaming product ,  those use data . 
or there is always a little microplane grater at a much lower price ,  which works wonderfully . 
it simply does not cut it at this price . 
i can blow harder than this thing can . 
the click ,  lock and go cover is a good idea though . 
hard to read  defeats the purpose if you can t tell the num_extend
that are better as stocking stuffers than as a gift such as a birthday gift . 
i was hoping the silverstone fans  crap  that i got with the case were more loud . 
i even have had sarah jessica parkers other scent dawn . 
this one actually had me wishing i could go home and change . 
however ,  from the first camping trip i was not a fan . 
in my case ,  the original batteries lasted num_num years . 
as far as driving games go ,  test drive offers nothing particularly compelling . 
nothing like teaching your kid something that isn t true . 
i have a check engine light on ,  code num_extend i believe on my chevy truck . 
the wii and num_extend both have failure rates of less than %
i purchased it since it was made by sony . 
it s still no betty crocker or hershey s chocolate ,  but it grows on you . 
they did not remain in place properly to create good suction and were a bit too thick . 
it is hard to find a good badminton set now days . 
i got it to work and it ran great for about three months . 
however it was not compatible with the phone ,  because it did not work at all !  . 
i am very disappointed !  this product used to be worth the extra $ i paid ,  but no more . 
i have had many of the others listed here and have had no problem with them . 
its very hard to use based on the instruction on the item . 
its not much better than a dried up paper towel compressed into i little disk . 
this coupler starter cracking at the outside edge the very first time i used it . 
the most was a little over two hours . 
i found these to be highly uncomfortable and ugly as well . 
i tried it twice and didn t get any better . 
ugh this foxy curls was a waste of money . 
it just doesn t stay on long enough to work !  it needs to be bigger with more elastic . 
at first this scent is the most gorgous smell ive ever smelled ,  than after that ,  run for cover . 
i tried it on and it still hangs in my closet ,  i will never wear it !  . 
a vacuum with a  revolutionary  system that does not allow it lose suction as it fills with dirt . 
i really wish that this had a fresher citrus scent . 
after a few months ,  the left ear phone stopped working . 
i was really excited to try the wave artist . 
it s a screen protector and when you re iphone is in sleep ,  you can use it as a mirror . 
i tried for a couple of days and returned it . 
i was using the headset with a samsung galaxy sii skyrocket  android  . 
this is an awful pair of wireless headphones ever . 
he tried it first day num_num min then a big no !  !  !  . 
they potentially had something so good in this game . the scenarios . 
lasted a couple of days until the dog peeled the cover off . 
 see link below  i have one of these . 
the shipping was quick enuff so no complaints there and the items description was pretty much as described . 
i like the fact that it is internal since i dont have a sump ,  so no overflow worries . 
i much prefer the jolly time kettle corn flavor . 
john frieda s fly away tamer does the best job on this one . 
it doesn t fit like the wocoal or natori num_extend bras i purchased at nordstrom . 
i think i ve been compelled to write only num_num or num_num reviews . 
the buttons are a little further apart and are more easily distinguishable . 
the problem is that it is all absolutely ruined by the other driver ai . 
okay ,  some things should collapse ,  such as beach chairs and tripods . 
i found the cloth skin in the hallway and the plastic inners in two different rooms . 
thought it was suitable for a kid to use but seems it s not built for that . 
when i would go to pick up after one use they would drip all over my floors still . 
after a day and a half it quit on me this morning . 
in additionto being as rough as boar hair ,  they also shed and get messy . 
it s pretty but we had to break it to get it off the iphone . 
that just won t fly for a power gamer like me . fail . 
my goal was to improve my boy s condition through diet ,  not put him in the hospital . 
this phone doesn t ,  and that s lame . too big :  the one problem i can t get past is the size . 
these are thermophilic yogurts ,  and require incubation at num_extend or very close . 
i wrote a previous review and gave this five stars . 
this is just a flat out horrible game . 
i returned this scam product !  don t buy this if you expect num_extend
the first issue i had was with the smell ,  which was hinting at being rancid . 
mtx fender does not fit the explorer rack by topeak nor the mtx trunk system . 
these did not fit on the stomp rocket . 
i started searching the web for answers and found out that everyone with this version is having problems . 
the first level of the first real movie in which your basically like dukes of hazards is tremendously hard . 
i d recommend smaller ,  chewable toys like the naturals mice instead . 
the upgrade system you use for your equipment is also fundamentally broken . 
even worse than medicines i have to take and can t stand . 
i had to use more to get enough lather ,  more than twice as much as num_extend
with in an hour there is a big puddle under it . 
as the game progressed though ,  and the number of units increased ,  all of the above made their gradual appearance . 
i find the the unit works well at home with a sophisticated receiver . 
this piece of equipment will only accept num_extend dd disks for the project info . 
i think maybe these were just old and too hard for the pup to enjoy . 
i didn t really notice much of a difference while taking this stuff . 
weaving in and out of traffic at high speed is almost impossible with some of the vehicles . 
the blade was not very sharp out of the box . 
seemed to make me more stressed out and not allow me to deal with stress well . 
my puppy had a hole chewed in it and was chewing on a piece of plastic . 
i gave this to my golden retriever puppy when she was teething . 
at first it performed well ,  despite the limited size assortment of sauce pans in the titanium classic line . 
leastways ,  not with my network and windows vista . 
and it wasn t even the part i was most worried about  the somewhat flimsy feeling plastic shell  . 
it would ve kept the ferrets from digging at the carpet if i could have used it . 
lol i guess alot of years have passed . 
this bag is a great size and very sturdy . 
none of the holes line up ,  camera slot ,  stylis port etc . 
i didn t even bother cleaning it ,  just returned the item . 
at first i thought it might be too hot to use but it wasn t . 
powder dry shampoo may be another option ,  but i haven t tried that one yet . 
i could have gotten a lot cheaper set but wanted quality . 
the smell and texture weren t very appealing either . 
i want to be completely satisfied with my purchase . 
i can t imagine attempting to remove a splinter . 
the reason for purchase was to try this bizarre looking product . 
the directions said for extra effect ,  leave a little on as a leave in conditioner . 
you get what you pay for ,  i guess . 
the brackets are plastic and wouldn t stay in place . 
i was wondering why there was only num_num servings in this num_extend bag . 
it s a magic marker for eyes that isn t as flexible as the photo provided would lead one to believe . 
only reason it gets two stars is because it covers the phone . 
the num_num does have better isolation due to enclosed design . 
and sprinkling raw oatmeal flakes on the top of these things is really unnecessary . 
i often swung my sword and cast spells just to the left or right of where my enemy stood . 
while it will charge ,  it simply won t connect to the computer via usb . 
i have tried everything to calm my num_num month old beagle . 
i d much rather swallow a tablet with the same things in it than to drink this fizz . 
blizzard rolled up both these features in diablo ii in much improved form . 
there s a slightly odd taste about this product that i can t figure out from the ingredients . 
other reviewers have covered these these points ,  so i ll try to be num_extend
i got this product because i am a sucker for organic products . 
then tried to use it again num_num month later and the poles were ruined . 
i like the idea of these gluten free brownie bars . 
it s a smooth glide from that point onwards ,  until eventually the end is reached ,  and the plug pops in . 
you can move left or right ,  not in or out . 
we ve had this for a few years now . 
it s really bulky also which i didn t like . 
this one had one of the shortest lives . 
they still need to update the product literature to remove the references to osprey . 
easy to beat and so boring at that . 
the clasps do not clasp shut most of the time . 
it s complex and interesting ,  i enjoyed making my character . 
i have used almost all of the jar and my wrinkles dont look any better . 
after reading all good reviews ,  i bought this pair of shoes . 
if you push down too hard while squeezing ,  it makes a much louder annoying noise . 
it won t blend on the skin at all . 
the concept of this toy is absolutely fantastic . 
i felt that the added features were just inconviniences that slowed the game down . 
i played nfl num_extend before but i gave madden a chance with the num_num rosters . 
meaning :  you have to back your dogs  arms back out of the arm holes . 
perhaps i am too dumb to make something this simple ?  . 
starcraft is one of the most annoying games ive ever played . 
the sound levels take a little adjusting to get right . 
i only had one packet of this so am unable to evaluate it on it s health benefits . 
this game has gotten a lot of bad reviews ,  and it earned  em . 
no background or wind noise ,  and very close to handset . 
these seriously do not look like this picture . 
these screen protectors are pretty much as disaster to try and put on . 
they are for my son in hawaii who has numerous health issues . 
so i am keeping it for other use . 
peach tea ,  on its own ,  is great; which is why i wanted to try this stuff . 
memory wise it is way better than the backflip and the processor is loads faster . 
but then .  .  . the other day i plugged a trusty sidewinder into the hub to play some old games . 
it should work well with my midland num_extend
its very clean  at first  and easy to maintain  at first  . 
there are some truly brutal tackles in this game . 
the radio stations and the street chatter are all of an excellent quality . 
he was probably having fun with the challenge but we just couldn t handle how loud it was . 
don t think i ll buy henckels products in the future . 
in defense of infallible i did buy it in a lite color .  .  . bloom . 
no matter what kind of media or even retail movies i used still no help . 
price is based on the webkinz name i think ,  not necessarily on the quality . 
i do not recommend this game !  don t buy it !  . 
another pile of crap i have wasted money on . 
there was also no  starter credit  as stated in the item photo . 
all im saying is dont be dumb and waste a lot of time . 
i purchased this as an extra cv controller for a digitech control num_extend
the name speaks for itself when it comes to comfort . 
i found it actually hurt me more than when i didn t wear it . 
unfortunately ,  that means she now needs num_num minutes to gulp down a meal instead of one . 
you could pass by me ten feet away and would want to plug your nose . 
that s because it is and it doesn t fit tight like the original . 
the only thing you re left with are some candy and ice cream molds . 
this is the worst game ever for a num_extend
chippies are taking the bait and getting out unscathed ,  or escaping afterwards . 
when i arrived home with it ,  and took it out of the box ,  i was very disappointed . 
i bought this exact product from a store locally . 
i puchased this toy to put in our game closet thinking that it would be alot of fun . 
i purchased the kensington num_extend computer cable and lock because i was familiar with the kensington brand . 
it works well enough to wash back but not exactly scrub it . 
after adding num_num to a large cup of coffee ,  i tasted a hint of cinnamon but not much . 
this is after a three week purging with fairly strong insecticides while still outdoors . 
the fit of this bra seemed oddly shaped . 
you can t even tell if this thing is running . 
on top of that ,  the music is pretty annoying to listen to . 
i can t even imagine how someone else would like them so i m really thinking the rave reviews are fake . 
i beat this game num_num times to see num_num endings . 
i am not usually a princess about these things ,  but i really couldn t stand the feel of this . 
let those fingernails grow ! actually ,  i m not sure why i bothered ,  because catnip has absolutely no effect on my beast . 
if i bought this i don t know what happened to it . 
it s a bad recorder and an even worse player . 
i suspect they were not made in china a decade+ ago . 
i tried to be superman and save everyone . 
this product left me with a rash ,  and pain . 
the adc is male ,  need female ,  the dvi is female ,  need male . 
amazon made it right but i am disappointed to receive old product . 
having to monitor everyone and move them along with you took a big fun factor out of the game . 
num_extend the top of the heater is bulky . 
the construction seems to be very good but with clamps like this what good are they ?  ?  ?  . 
of course everyone will give this game num_num stars because their favorite character is in it . 
they both also act to deodorize as well as clean . 
however ,  these slimy noodles are really not good to eat . 
it was better than any mower i ve ever owned . 
to make a long story short ,  the pyle pro is much louder ,  and has better features . 
i checked and ironically i ordered this drive a year ago to the day . 
setting up dvi is not a problem as other reviewers have noted ,  however . 
your coconut oil should smell like you re on a beach in the caribbean . 
just use a white paper towel and rub the whisk ,  you will see black stuffs come off . 
unfortunately i have extremely sensitive skin and was allergic to something in their products . 
tis gun is plastic and broke the first day as i try to put the batteries in . 
if my stretch marks did fade ,  it was probably because of time and not this product . 
i love lavender but this did not smell to me as it should . 
it won t stay in place with socks ,  so it s only good if we go out . 
it also now has a weird texture and doesn t  bunch up  the way it used to . 
the one i got was also missing one of the mounting bolts . 
i used it for almost num_num weeks and it was just like i wasn t wearing anything . 
i tried to learn to like the taste ,  but it did not happen ,  no matter how hard i tried . 
first ,  the hat on the little person is not secure . 
in fact ,  it was a little frizzier than normal . 
i replaced it with a belkin n wireless router ,  which was up and running in no time at all . 
moving on you can use heat vision ,  super breath ,  and freeze breath . 
just not a good setup compared to other brands . 
ultimately ,  this battery door is more broken than the one i had before hand . 
i sent them back and got some pioneer speakers that fit perfectly . 
i decided this new year that i wanted to overhaul my cosmetics . 
the control is rather overly complicated and isn t exactly user freindly . 
he also installed the rock solid scope mount for me also and removed the rear sight dove tail . 
they wanted to charge me what i paid for them to fix it . 
the title of this product says that it is a rubber case . 
i used the mitt from the spray and i still ended up with blotches ,  but no tan . 
however ,  like many others ,  neither of the num_num adapters i ve bought lasted more than a few months . 
i tried early on to give disks it could burm without trouble :  tdk ,  memorex ,  verbatim . 
he again said i should return it to the vendor . 
the phone  samsung epic num_extend touch  paired perfectly . 
i really tried this with an open mind . 
because of these problems ,  i rarely use these racks . 
the matching ankle holster was well made and well padded . 
first ,  he complained that the packet contained three small candies . 
they basicly showed the gaming world what not to do . 
the unit smelled like cigarette smoke ,  and the controller looked as it had been used . 
the spring in the unit pushes the two way out of the num_extend socket . 
i much rather have plates that disassemble and go on the dishwasher . 
these were by far the most discusting foul tasting gf product i have ever tried . 
i got to admit my dogs ate this food . 
this stuff just gooped up on it s own . 
has a nice feel and look to it and shoots with good power . 
two of my three cats love the turbo maze ,  so it gets num_num stars ,  but the rest is useless . 
i should have taken my fellow amazon . com shoppers advice about this case and just skipped it . 
i ve had numerous very erratic behaviors from my drone . 
i sent it back due to a scratch on the inside of the stockpot . 
i know rancid oil when i taste it ,  and this is the worst i have ever tried to eat . 
the build quality on this lense is cheap . 
i will eat them ,  but they do not have the kind of flavor i was dreaming of . 
i also noticed the character designs seemed a little distorted at time . 
i was affraid everything from this machine was going to taste this way . 
the train doesn t fit on his train track ,  and the dinosaur doesn t sit in it . 
any kind of shawl from a cheap acrylic to whatever could have been put into this wrapper . 
the bite surfaces are soft and spongy ,  which i liked . 
i feel like i have been ripped off . 
the lasermax replacement slide lock can and does pull out by hand . 
and as an audiophile and audio enthusiast ,  i ve owned many over the years ,  both cheap and expensive . 
for the same monetary price i d recommend lego star wars . 
this out of all the cases i have use is the best for my personal situation . 
that s ok though because i feel sorry for anyone that would buy this p . o . s . 
very disappointed . everything about this charger looks authentic ,  except that the lights are blue . 
once again ,  another frustrating thing about this product . 
the inner layer of silicone that shields the side buttons renders it nearly impossible to press them down . 
that way ,  i get a brand new console instead of a refurbished unit . 
then ,  filtering out all the same recycled platformers from a decade ago ,  you have about num_extend
the color of the product was a dark tan color . 
and i got the product with a hole in it . 
the problem ,  in retrospect ,  appears to be the rennet tablets . 
it appears that many buyers have had this filter fall apart on them . 
i may be able to get into it one day ,  if i stay on my diet . 
it doesn t allow her to use her imagination in any way . 
these are pretty impractical pens ,  they are sleek and stylish . 
if that is not one of your criteria ,  i highly recommend it . 
at first i thought i was doing something wrong ,  so i tried different things . 
this is the sort of bar that you would find in the grocery store . 
the black socks feel like % polyester . both the black and white socks feel pretty thick and warm . 
he all of a sudden began pooping on a bedspread instead of the litter box . 
seemed like the ones i saw came from people who wrote only one review total . 
linksys should at least print the version number on the outside of the box . 
i love the  smoky eyes  look so i thought this product would be exactly what i need . 
the first time i ordered i got a great product . 
first day i tried it ,  i took a spoon full . 
the multiplayer is what sells these games ,  they could have done alot better . 
the sennheiser num_extend $ are some of the best around . 
it is now going on  nine  weeks and i still have not received the repaired or replacement unit . 
i tried this mask twice with the same results . 
i came here by recommendation of kandee johnson from youtube . 
how many times do you want to do that ,  especially with what they are charging ?  . 
it sounds cool ,  got good reviews ,  but just didnt work for me . 
as usual ,  though ,  the handheld versions get the short end of the stick . 
it seemed like a real bargain ,  given the price . 
before you buy this item ,  call netgear support and see if you can get through . 
however ,  there is no way that i could drink a whole bottle of this concoction of any flavor . 
not the way video games should be made . 
she ll occasionally carry one around in her mouth from one room to another ,  but she won t chew them . 
the holes for the letters are very shallow ,  and they fall out if barely even bumped . 
when i started using cetaphil ,  my skin was overly sensitive . 
they were used only inside the home and handled carefully . 
yeah thats it the game will make exillent firewood . 
it advertised all those features ,  but cannot implement any one of them properly . 
way smoother ,  more fun to play ,  mapped out great ,  and better scenery overall . 
at first ,  i tried to take it off at night in the customary way and had an awful time . 
i don t recommend that ,  unless sticky is your thing . 
it broke where it was supposed to pivit while inserting it in my ear one day . 
six other folks i work with have purchased this game . 
some screens you have to use a scroll bar ,  others you just drag your finger to scroll down . 
the bristles on this brush are so short that it doesn t really do anything for me . 
i made the switch from the conventional mouse when i started to notice my wrist aching . 
he says irritating things like  this doesn t look good !  you better be careful !   . 
nikon is not doing this in any way . thanks for nothing ,  nikon . 
most of the third party games are really weak . 
but my son liked it however doest use it much . 
this is the biggest joke of a phone i have ever seen . 
i suggest you wait for other reviews to come in before you hit the game stores . 
however ,  at least half of that time is replaying the same thing over and over . 
in my opinion ,  these were not cheap by any means and i expected them to last . 
i dont expect this to last me more than num_num months tops . 
i found myself quoting mae west after the first stage .  .  is that all ?  ?   . 
i have used it and i let my teen daughter use it with my supervision . 
with this kit ,  at least for now ,  you ll need to make two num_extend purchases . 
for the price of num_extend this is a great deal . 
this matters a lot on a very specific part like this . 
neither of my seafood loving cats liked this at all . 
it goes on very clumpy and dries so stiff it flakes throughout the day . 
i used it as directed for two weeks . 
if i wanted clear polish i would just use what i already have ,  top it off . 
to start ,  the graphics aren t even close to num_extend pitching and batting motion is strange ,  even cartoon like . 
one scratch and my cat ripped the thing up . 
the bottom is off the end of the butt of the gun . 
i tried turning it and the other devices off and on again ,  and doing the process all over . 
characters seemed limited with a low number of moves and special moves that are way below spectacular ,  extremely below . 
the other reviewer was luckier than i was . 
if this sounds like you ,  great !  it s great to have a passion and this mower is for you . 
it keeps trying to flip around from the back where it is plugged into the wall . 
from constant use for many years it was lost . 
one of our num_num cats plays with it for a minute or two each morning . 
however ,   healthy choice  has yet to learn that trick . 
i can only assume that people don t really understand it . 
yard butler generally makes good products that i like . 
i needed one gem and it was in the thieves den . 
the  vibration  feature which is supposed to enhance bass y effects is absolutely horrific . 
after a week of use the clip on the stealth broke . 
the price of these anker batteries for the samsung galaxy note seemed too cheap to really be good quality . 
i normally wear a large ,  wish i woulda ordered an xl . 
this one i can t even adjust around the neck to fit any of my larger dogs . 
as i mentioned in my first paragraph ,  it supports wpa security ,  which is far superior to wep . 
the jars kept falling off ,  leaving their magnets stuck to the rack . 
i hung it in the shade but it still leaks like crazy . 
this product is better suited for kids under num_num years of age imo . 
there are just too many unhappy stories among these customer reviews . 
like i said get what you pay for these didn t even make it to the woods . 
unfortunantly i am unable to use this product . 
my gosh , it was wonderful not to be limping out the door at work . 
i almost wished it weren t steady ,  so she d be afraid to climb up on it . 
well ,  i own a lot of magnifying glasses ,  and start fires easily with each one . 
he loves to pull the stuffing and squeekers out of his toys . 
i dropped my phone a few times ,  and it never even made much of a noise . 
if i get it going i will update my review . 
and guess what ?  most of the time they did . 
i haven t shot it in over a year . 
it doesn t do much besides light up and sing some songs  that stop too quickly  . 
i am at the point where it would almost be more worth it to purchase a different gun !  . 
sorry ,  but these pants leave so much to the imagination . 
that is great and all ,  unless the lock returns to it s default code . 
it has the same consistency ,  the same scent ,  it feels the same ,  it works the same . 
this shoe was much too wide and would not stay on my foot . 
i am also disappointed that the amazon website did not list that it contained gelatin in it s product description . 
mine is a combination of defects and poor design . 
try the unreal series  ,  half life or rainbow num_extend
really disappointed that stockmar is misrepresenting its product ,  these are not % beeswax like they state . 
i also bought socks with the no slip on the bottom and they do the trick . 
you would have to be using a chemical peel to have that effect on your skin . 
when i got them i realized they wayyyyy toooo small . 
after having read all the positive reviews ,  i was expecting really a lot . 
it was cheap so i don t feel too bad . 
i purchased this jacket for my female yellow labrador retriever . 
maybe i just got a bad one ,  but why take the chance ?  . 
so it s probably going to be fine if you just don t put them down hard on an angle ,  ever . 
all in all the unit did not reliably do anything it was intended to do . 
my teeth are the same as they were . 
i intend to replace them with some speakers that shound good quite soon . 
what i disliked most about this tank ,  is that it s not that soft . 
i used the case for a few days ,  took it off ,  and never used it again . 
i got sick of crappy mounts so i bought three the same day and decided to stop messing around . 
it has metal gears and is made of stainless steel . 
this product did not work for my input devices . 
this isn t very clear when you come in via the num_num or num_num port switches . 
instead you have to select the customer service path on the phone tree . 
the command doesn t always go through and i found the wires annoying . 
i just bought two new packs and hane s is definitely cutting corners on their product . 
it s fine for level parking ,  but don t use this on sloping grades . 
i will post a final photo at the end of the treatment . 
the packaging and product quality appears high end . 
the outter area of the scope image is blurred and all you can see is the center area . 
to me ,  it smells like something an old woman would wear . 
expect to reconfigure settings over and over and over again . 
i saw this and thought  this will make drinking coffee easier  . 
wonder why this product was allowed to go to market ?  . 
what a bunch of hype ,  deceptive marketing strategies ,  waste of time and hard earned money . 
it made me feel kind of sick and that is strange because ginger is so good for the stomach . 
i feel the quality has also degraded some what with video games too . 
these bridge the data lines so you don t have to worry about if the charger does it or not . 
most players have long since abandoned trying to make sense of it . 
i purchased this sled for my daughter as a gift for christmas . 
i brushed off the negative reviews and gave this a shot . 
yes ocarina of time was ok ,  but not good enough to save this series . 
at first the coats look good and good material probably good for smaller dogs . 
so ,  at num_extend ounces this is a slightly bigger drink . 
as i finish the last can ,  i am not as fond of this product as i used to be . 
the one in the center of the box lifted right off . 
quality and freshness was good but the couscous has no flavor at all . 
what i do know is that i would never order an num_extend through here . 
why not a simpsons skateboarding game ?  well ,  it s the way this game was executed that doesn t deliver . 
well ,  i got this based off a blog i found on pinterest and was thoroughly unimpressed . 
but in the dark ,  this thing is a strobe light . 
i have had some complaints from people saying they could not hear me . 
both dogs liked it and ate it with no problems . 
finally ,  they are a very light material ,  unlike regular levis . 
the pencils are very hard and the product does not apply easily . 
i also updated the os version , via rand mcnally . 
repeated or prolonged contact can cause defatting and drying . eyes :  slightly irritating . 
the flavors are good ,  but the texture is super super sticky ,  and i m not a fan of that . 
fails to shave fine neck hairs no matter how hard you press or stretch the skin . 
in one instance ,  once the bee recovered from being shocked ,  it just flew away . 
the boot is far too wide from my num_extend foot . 
i got this for cheap but based from online recommedations and i don t particularly like it . 
after three days of driving with it ,  i have learned to simply ignore the tones . 
however ,  you can only access these one random word at a time . 
gun valkyrie has great graphics ,  but the controls and background music just plain bites the big one . 
i was very pleased with this thermal carafe . 
bought two different sizes ,  but on both pair ,  my thighs bulge out as if i m wearing yoga pants . 
bright screen ,  powerful fast processer ,  loads of memory . 
everything feels uninspiring and cold . the gameplay is just as bad . 
we re talking beaks ,  chicken feet ,  eyeballs ,  even chicken poop !  i would not recommend this product . 
first ,  the case looks almost nothing like the picture . 
the game sounded fun and looked scary from videos . 
in respect to what others have said about static . 
trust me ,  this muzzle is useless as a muzzle !  . 
how would you like if someone cut off the tops of all your fingers ?  . 
it s a much better card game to carry around on your travels . 
it s kind of sad that this is all the game is about when it comes down to it . 
the theft soon plunges the land into a horrible state . 
one taste and this went in the trash . 
i m so disappointed !  but i certainly don t think myself the  careful exception  any longer . 
litterally threw it into the trash because it would not stay on . 
if they keep making it with rusty stainless and stretched out silicones soontheir name will be a  beware  company . 
when you compare it to the zero lemon batteries that are out for this phone . 
just remember when purchasing this product that one num_extend oz . 
typically went num_num seconds of supplying power ,  twenty without . 
it would make for easy storage . putting it together took less than five minutes . 
take whatever function and you d never guess how unnatural an interface they came up with . 
it doesn t make sense to me why it would be especially with this style . 
dead just under num_num years after placed in service  actual usage time about num_num months  . 
by morning my lower back ,  hip and thigh were covered in patches . 
one of the iphones  my moms phone  is a num_extend and the cord will not charge it . 
for sheer curiosity ,  i tried zelda at a friend s house . 
in conclusion ,  i will never purchase this again . 
read the reviews and thought it might be worth it . 
real shame i did not know that before buying it for my cats . 
ok ,  i brought it home and threw it on my office chair here . 
i don t like it ,  i can t get it to stay in the crate ,  it keeps slipping . 
i have num_extend hair and this product did not moisturize nor add shine . 
it was a big fat waste of money . 
if you must own a rio get a num_num atleast you can use smart media cards . 
after all the training  about a month  my cat was using the toilet . 
it doesnt even fit my verizon iphone num_extend
i tried filing the tab down but that did not work . 
my advice ,  spend more money for a better product . 
i have been using proactiv for num_num years . 
the earring backs need to be a little more snug . 
sweet graphics ,  cool storyline ,  gameplay like halo ,  xbox live play . 
i enjoy gloria jean s coffees ,  but did not like this particular flavor . 
i am sure that with a few weeks or even day s usage this will be useless . 
there was no warning at all on this item !  . 
it does nothing to relieve my dry eyes . 
i was so happy with this product when i ordered it a couple times last year . 
i did the troubleshooting and work a few times more . 
these particular memorex cd labels are a much lower quality then what is advertised here . 
but this screen is too small and frustrating for them to preview anything they took on . 
this can be very frustrating when one is hurrying to prepare dinner for hungry teenagers . 
i don t know what causes this smell ,  but it makes me nervous to drink this tea at all . 
i hiked three miles today and i have major blisters on both heels . 
but i bought the num_num pack so i have another one to use . 
the flavor is almost like the smell of a dirty aquarium and the texture is even worse . 
collection cup cracked as it is nearly impossible to tighten ,  it leaks . 
lockups ,  server rollbacks that make you redo portions of the game ,  disconnections ,  lag . 
i expected them to be larger given i ordered the ginormous size ,  and i was highly disappointed . 
booo !  !  !  i was extremely disappointed with this product . 
this actually deserves no stars because it is now a useless piece of plastic . 
this did the job without damaging the watch in anyway . 
no one answered and was told to leave a message . 
the volume is also very loud but that s no longer an issue since i taped over the speaker . 
the genuine item provides a reasonably well regulated num_num volts . 
i do not recommend this product it is a big waste of money and a mess !  . 
not really happy ,  was hoping for a different material that doesn t do that . 
the combat is extremely stiff ,  and aside from random grunts and moans ,  nothing special . 
i can t say you will get a new one or a refurbished one . 
these titles were meant like the first num_num re games ,  this game sucks like re dead aim . 
i do have to give parrot credit for creating a product so repairable and having every part available . 
i am surprised with all the good reviews that i hated it . 
after fiddling around with the plug ,  it worked again . 
but i won t buy these again ,  even though they taste great . 
so i exchanged it for another one ,  same thing . 
it s very uncomfortable and hurt if using num_extend straight . 
one for my blackberry storm num_num and the other for my motorola droid . 
if i could give this item a zero star i would . 
the biggest problem is that the oven door and dishwasher door are hinged at the bottom ,  not the side .

my num_extend and orangerx receivers have not been a problem ,  but that could be lucky . 
the leather also folds inward near the edge . 
my original visor is about num_num inches longer at the bill and black underneath . 
the two mic karaoke input is a plus . 
with this product you receive a little bottle that looks like clear nail polish . 
i ordered the red and i regret that purchase . 
i took it back to exchange for a linksys . 
i really did not think i would like this game . 
it s completely neutered from the japanese version instead it plays catch up with the japanese versions . 
i don t know why but both my dogs didn t touch it . 
the backs are great; the earrings themselves are dull and cheap looking . 
it doesn t work with all of the num_extend players in the house . 
you reset it by pressing the minute and second button at the same time . 
looks and works great ,  but the hinge is very thin and flimsy . 
the voice dial is just as bad ,  if not worse . 
once it was gone ,  i realized it had just been masking the smell and it was still present . 
the plastic parts are horribly fragile and cheaply made ,  but i did not see any alternative . 
all of them had dents from being dropped at one time or another . 
no ,   easy  mode or  medium  for guys like me ,  only hard for the fan num_extend ai is completely unbalanced . 
i would pay  at most  four or five dollars for a kit like this . 
i have used a kensington expert mouse for almost num_num years and have never had a complaint till now . 
i am stuck with num_num bags of this tasteless stuff . 
bottom flaps arrive popped loose from the lower side . 
much like conan the barbarian revenge upon your father s grave is the primary focus for igniting the plot . 
that is what these pants are like . also ,  i would say don t get the twill . 
plus ,  the volume feature didn t work with my phone or ipod . 
i can t fathom a reason why since bloodlines is a better game . 
that broke the back cover and made the bezel no longer fit . 
they could have either omitted the whole switch thing or put a decent switch in this thing . 
i purchased this item at the end of april num_extend
didn t realized it until it had arrived and saw the packaging . 
didn t do much with my sore throat and the spray on the bottle is too strong making me gag . 
unbelievably ,  two weeks was the life of these slippers . 
first ,  i was ability to twist and bend the connection going into the car and it started working again . 
more importantly the steam output is not sufficient to remove difficult wrinkles or wrinkles from heavy materials . 
i realized after i bought these that i really didn t want boy shorts . 
i would never ,  ever carry a gun in it . 
consider using a mild hydrocortisone cream  otc  on irritated areas after to help healing and reduce swelling and redness . 
numerous small radios that you must listen thru earpieces and not thru speakers . 
these socks are probably for a shoe size num_extend
so we just kept it off and continued to play . 
now i could not hear any sound from my right side headphone . 
if he dont like it it will end up on a garage shelve not to be used again . 
i bought this to hold up a small camera . 
after several days of usage ,  that griddle works great if you are looking for another alternative to this one . 
when i opened it the sweet potatos had white fuzzy mold on them . 
it did okay grating carrots ,  but a hand grater is just about as easy . 
the phone warns you that its getting too much voltage . 
i dont know why anyone would want to purchase the black color . 
like this one ,  it is thin and nice to look at .

i m very disappointed that it would break so easily . 
once to see if it fit and once to test it . 
i washed mine three times and spent several hours picking out the lint and fuzz stuck on the towels . 
wtf ? the next issue is the weird  fizz  sound ,  that was especially noticeable on the low e .

morpheus was wrong ,  because neo s not the one . 
i really loved it at first ,  it was perfect . 
this cup is horribly designed and the quality is even worse . 
this one looked so sleek and attractive so i bought num_extend
it now looks like a gray bowling pin . 
the third one was less crooked ,  but still wonky ,  and none of them had a decent braze . 
my roomate says that can actually tear up pads because they don t recieve the correct voltage . 
how this got past quality control is beyond me . 
the bristles of the brush fall out several at a time each time i use it . 
i don t like complaining ,  but please don t waste your money . 
the graphics ,  even though they may have been updated a little more for the xbox ,  are bad .

i have been wanting the bumpits for some time . 
but my problem was with the packaging and shipping . 
i thought it might possibly be close to what i had but cheaper since the brush looked similar . 
i will say the build quality is great but too short ,  is and remains ,  too short .

tonight ,  i could not get the food off of the pan . 
the images aren t crisp and sharp and the colors are a little flat . 
my local walmart has kits that are more substantiative for a lot less money . 
the catalog needs to be explicit in which filter system a filter will fit . 
it has to be constantly adjusted to keep from spinning left or right . 
i was looking around and came across these ,   natural ,   flavored bones and thought . 
the handle is hollow and uncomfortable to hold .

nothing in the description when you order says this .

i should have read the reviews before ordering this product . 
this might be the best you can find .

our motorola bluetooth died after many years of use . 
my parents got this for my son when he turned num_num a few weeks ago . 
muscle milk in its powdered form is known as cytosport .

i love the battles in theory .  .  . however ,  in execution ,  there are numerous problems . 
then the third time it totally stopped working .

this product has nothing on the rabbit but i bought it because i couldn t find the rabbit online . 
the blue flash at eash attempt is not some thing i care to see in an electrical appliance .

product took much longer to arrive than promised . 
you can t even tell what some of it is . 
i had to shore up the second level with a video cassette tape box which really worked . 
i removed it within a day of putting it on . 
if you want microfiber make sure the material actually feels like microfiber . 
i bought this as an alternative to the fire steels . 
plus it was so hard to unscrew the valve tip to add air . 
movement is awkward and laggy ,  even at low resolutions . 
not for me ,  for this type of accessory ,  it is better to go and see it before buying . 
yes ,  it was raining .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . but it wasn t like i was swimming or anything . 
it tastes like raw beans covered in bad chocolate syrup . 
it hasn t worked right since then . another problem is that it wastes an amazing amount of plastic material . 
i stopped using this pos headset my phone is doing just fine . 
you drop it once ,  and it s broken and the blade no longer stays on the body . 
it was too long height wise and too skinny width wise . 
anyway i ,  will give them to someone else . 
some of the levels were really bad but some were alright . 
i will still put  goldeneye  on the top of the list as being the forerunner in this category . 
there are several different usb ends ,  enough that one can t tell by a seller s description which one it is . 
mine has never been used and paint chipped off . 
these noodles are thicker than normal which is why the longer cooking time and claim to won t fall apart . 
i will go back to my old brand of eye cream . 
bioschock was too compressed ,  too much voice over exposition . 
all it will do is just slow the discharge of a single num_extend let alone charge two devices connected . 
only light sunglasses with small sides will work in this unit . 
this is equivilant to the sony disaster !  dont buy this malware if you value your operating system . 
this is why all the reviewers have sizing issues . 
my poor chihuahua would have only been dragging it on the ground . 
the first is the  jog  toggle that allows your character to run in tristram . 
there are much better ,  both convenient and healthy spices and herbs combinations  real food  to choose . 
do not buy this if you have windows xp home . 
i could get over the texture for the price but i can t get over the smell . 
the sound quality and price are great ,  can t complain . 
the new flavor is overpowering and has an artificial aftertaste that lasts for at least half an hour . 
i wrote an email and never received feed back on it . 
i m able to replace the glass in about num_num minutes now ,  so maybe that is a consideration for some . 
it is much more convenient to use the cleansing pads by hand rather than with the skinvitalizer . 
i bought several packs of this as spare or replacements after i bought fluval canister filter num_extend
i usually get num_num out of num_num helpful ,  and that s on a good day . 
less comfortable and less functional than normal underwear . 
i wanted to be able to take something natural in place of ibuprofen etc . 
something that you all may never own up to . 
i really wanted some pain relief; i wanted this product to work . 
i never fail to be impressed by how he helps people grow and learn about game development . 
asthetically ,  it is very homely looking ,  more like something you would scrub a car with . 
the blisters got worse ,  broke open ,  and it took over a week for my face to completely heal . 
it didn t lather up well and was harder to remove with water . 
take it off the can and it seems like it has full power . i wouldn t recommend it . 
it scares the crud out of my son . 
ahh zelda ,  arguably the greatest video game franchise ever made . 
these dogs run maybe num_num seconds giving a possible num_num supposed cleanings before rewind . 
i get none of what should be in all the reviews that are positive . 
never again flavor is nasty and you can not swallow  , wash down fast enough . 
game is pretty much a fold out board with dots across leading to the other side . 
other than that the item quality is good and it s holding up . 
that probably explains why it s rather boring tasting . 
don t use with modern cell phones if you value speed of charging at all . 
if your hair is oily ,  then i think this would be fine . 
you have to keep assigning units to do it . 
that alone is amazing and worth the price . another reviewer mentioned that this was heavy ,  making it hard to use . 
this is rather bland for a premium blend . 
worked great for three weeks then cat just stopped responding . 
i started looking into the product reviews and several users have similar experiences if not worse . 
our california water is very poor quality ,  which means i burn through the zero filters quickly . 
i researched amazon s reviews for a small num_extend player that i could use for running and working out with . 
i had to call them and talk to someone to get a return authorization . 
the framerate is the most serious problem :  even on an empty open road ,  the graphics can become jerky . 
the younger girls will definitely not be able to use this . 
nintendo is reselling you a gamecube in a new box .  .  . don t be a fool . 
if you have the choice between this and the xbox num_num version ,  however .  .  . you know which one to buy !   ?  . 
i had a hard time getting them to stay put . 
my problem is that this product just doesn t last . 
you ve saved me thousands over the years !  amazon is an impressive vendor ,  and its customers are even moreso . 
i was pretty disappointed with this ,  and will probably very rarely use it . 
once the coffee was done the smell mellowed a little but still was not appealing . 
the man on it is a bit too big and heavy . 
i did not purchase this from amazon ,  but from target . 
the reception of the product is great but the earloop keeps falling off . 
the chips were awful !   wound up throwing the bag away . 
any fine ground sugar will make a great source of food . 
the consistency is nice ,  and a little drop goes a long way ,  but to me it smells rancid . 
we used at home num_num times the third one we realized that the  steinless steel  bowl was rusting . 
unfortunately the shoe that came was a soft footbed so i had to send it back . 
i initially bought it to ease the pain of peeling garlic when i make num_num clove garlic chicken . 
it made such a difference on my desktop that i bought num_num brand new intellimice . 
i don t know what made me request this product to review . 
having to  kill  the same boss monster over and over again makes you feel like you re going in num_extend
wasted my money for this slow hub .  .  . be aware that if you want to connect your printer ,  scanner ,  ipod etc . 
we are a paraben free household so will have to return . 
really ?  ! what a waste of money ,  i m sorry i ever bought it . 
it s not an easy or very appealing color to describe . 
this is overpriced for the amount of wheat grass you re getting . 
ok ,  for a toddler to get this going takes a lot of effort . 
i beat him on my first try and in less than a minute . 
perhaps this would have made armband too loose for those who don t use a case . 
his purpose in life is to locate and destroy the squeaker . 
the calories amounted to num_extend num_num of which were from fat . 
mind you i wear a size num_num and only num_num lbs . 
i didn t overwork it; i simply wanted to connect my laptop and my desktop to my dsl ethernet connection . 
there are no conversation chains; just a number for each  tell me about  subject . 
one star for amazon and their num_extend party seller ,  electronics expo . 
these bags were purchased as a package with the cordless vacuum and replacement belts i purchased . 
we only have some factors that can increase your  risk .   ex . 
of the dozens of hot wheels we ve accumulated ,  none worked well . of course there isn t much to this toy . 
the first box to get stepped on will be gone . 
announcers saying things at the wrong times or audio being cut off half way through their sentence . 
i had trouble keeping it together long enough to attach the acrylic panels . 
onguard uses laser cut keys ,  case hardened master lock padlocks are more secure than this u lock . 
had a rough time installing them  ,  i have the num_num magnum desert eagle vii produced in num_extend
however despite my skin being oilier ,  it still dried it out like crazy . 
bounds guarantees their products for life ,  i might just send this one back and try again . 
she did not react immediately ,  but after a couple of days the product was also bothering her skin . 
but no she hates it ,  waste of money . 
using it with hot tap water is useless ,  even with the vapor packet in the water . 
spend a few extra bucks and get a good one instead ,  and avoid the headaches . 
once again i should have listened to what others were saying about this product . 
buyers beware !  this product is not even worth buying . 
then i turned my head and the dryer fell off and broke the stand . 
again this item is not available  model num_extend
sometimes i have to do it several times just to get it to charge my iphone . 
i have the belly band as long as it can go but it isnt enough . 
glad i tried to get it ready early rather than waiting . 
water sits in it all of the time .  .  . no rust or tarnish at all . 
i purchased it for my cell phone but it s way too small to hold any cellphone . 
i would of given it num_num stars because it died num_num months after i purchase it right out of warranty  . 
and after a while it never recharged again ,  so i had to tossed in the trash . 
lastly ,  my dogs weren t even interested in the treats that fell on the floor . 
this  feature  is a little disconcerting and makes me wonder what other tricks it is playing on me . 
so i bought these for our almost num_num year old for christmas . 
oh well ,  they made me laugh and then i had to thrown them out . 
none . i immediately repacked this item and will be returning it for a refund . 
the first replacement unit from sony would not boot up ,  so it also went back to sony . 
bought this based on the reviews and what a waste of money . 
it is also drying ,  which is weird for a moisture lotion . 
i ve verified each morning that the switch was in the  on  position . 
i used it daily ,  kept it clean ,  and charged it as recommended . 
it comes with a string set to hang from the ceiling but we played with ours and it popped . 
in general ,  i don t have a problem with long dungeons . 
i m pretty sure i could pull all of the bristles out if i wanted to . 
this is a single sheet of fabric ,  supposedly reusable many times . 
i was hoping to use it to connect an htc evo to an older television . 
within a month ,  she was complaining that the glass screen had become loose . 
who designed this thing ?  all it does is get smashed and caught in everything and get in the way . 
one of the things that turn doesn t fit well and falls out . 
this isn t true of all topical flea treatments .  .  . but it s true of frontline plus . 
wow ,  i can t believe i bought this ,  was a pile of trash . 
so ,  for slightly more than the price of a new hamilton beach unit ,  i can replace the work bowl . 
second ,  if you have it it dragges across the screen and the end of the tool is too wide . 
heats up fast but does not curl and my hair curls easily with everything else . 
i went in started the tub and got in and used my regular shampoo and conditioner . 
so they handed it over to the younger cousins ,  ages num_num num_extend
what a terrible product !  it broke literally in num_num minutes of normal use . 
i am having to hold him on the table to keep him from hanging himself on the noose portion . 
these technically make the pots a little lighter ,  but not enough to justify the cost . 
i thought my nose and sinuses would explode from the intense wasabi sting . 
i don t think it works very well at all . 
i bought this to use after having hip replacement surgery . 
if anyone out there knows of a slipper that will support my tired feet ,  please share the information . 
compared to other toys ,  this puzzle just doesn t hold up to regular use by a toddler . 
the wbcl had a slightly less offensive smell ,  but the clumping capabilities were not as good as nm . 
while it looks pretty good in my kitchen ,  its actual ability to toast is very poor . 
i have the game guide in may bath room . 
i ll put it in the first aid kit ,  but we won t be using it every day . 
i just don t think this thing gets cold enough . 
these are advertized as % cotton .   last i checked ,  that meant all cotton ,  nothing else . 
nice shape to start but shrinks fast after washes . 
my brother got this for his earthlink dsl . 
if ,  playing ,  outside keep mat on a level surface . 
i don t recomend ordering these unless you want to have a whole house full of kids . 
two ,  my cat was afraid of it !  he wouldn t even approach it . 
forget about it disolving in water !  not very appetizing . 
they all pale in comparison to other games in the genre like fatal frame ,  resident evil ,  and clocktower . 
could not get a good focus on higher magnification . 
i wrote olympus twice over a year ago ,  but they never responded . 
many a ramen noodles were eaten the week i wasted my money on this . 
this is a natural and yet no one builds such a unit that i can find . 
the lather puffs up and then disappears in less than a minute . 
regardless ,  the mattress shouldn t give out after a few normal uses . 
an expensive product with sleek look ,  but poor manufacturing quality . 
here is the result : the point is not whether it is naturally occurring ,  or whether it contains other nutrients . 
rip offs of the seven dwarves from snow white . 
slippery to hold ,  thin ,  came cracked ,  sent back . 
i figured out that one of the air valves on the pump itself doesn t work any more . 
customer service told me to unplug the card before booting up and then insert the card . 
i d give this five stars if the sizing were accurate . 
took me a couple of months to work up the nerve to use it . 
a roll of quilt batting will last months . 
this is very flimsy and doesn t provide support worth mentioning . 
i have tried this product only num_num times since purchasing num_num months ago . 
i haven t eaten it in years ,  and i had heard that it s much improved recently . 
almost every package had alot of burnt tasting veggie sticks . 
but thats all the game excel s at ,  graphics . 
imperial glory suffers from one major flaw :  it tries to be num_num games at once . 
since these are to be used by folks doing sports etc . 
also ,  the scent is a bit unattractive ,  almost like some kind of clay . 
it s a hassle of course and i hate having to buy all the refills . 
well ,  i discovered why it didn t work very well . 
for the money the tecsun num_extend is much better . 
this might work for the kind of dark circles caused by fatigue which mine aren t . 
i bought this for two large puppies that play with everything . 
the coating so thin you can wipe it off with your fingers . 
add to that the thickness of the door edge and there is even less . 
but i will probably take it away from him . 
i was looking for pure aloe vera juice for health reasons . 
pirate s booty makes popped chips that are way better . 
don t waste your money on a knock off wand . 
after reading all the reviews i thought my dog was going to scarf this food down . 
this case does a good job of recharging your iphone ,  as you would assume it would . 
i am furious !  i had ordered them last march and they were wonderful . 
the game tested you in many catagories ,  and in the end ,  you were a better gamer than before . 
the serrated blade is very thick but not very sharp . 
if you have narrow feet ,  this is the shoe for you . 
the ones with mixed colors are so much better . 
my do has long hair  shih tzu  so maybe it will work for short hair dogs . 
i went back to my old camera bag . 
oz and decided to give it a try . 
this is not what was expected at all . 
doesn t slide on or mount correctly in anyway . 
last few times i tried to make smoothies ,  they ended up tasting like burnt rubber . 
i do not hunt from a stand or blind . 
i wish there was a  reset  button so it could point north . 
well i bought these num_extend because of the sound quality i read about during the opinions . 
i tried this a while ago ,  back when i had bad body acne in my teens . 
normally i love lodge cast iron cookware but this item should not have been shipped to anyone . 
now ,  as other have mentioned ,  adding more legs doesn t increase speed more than a better num_extend foot . 
but after about a year of use ,  i began breaking out and just thought it was my skin . 
they are no good at all for an outside living farm dog . 
the holes on the front don t line up for the screws that are mandates by the airlines . 
i could almost get the phone into the position that i liked . 
i guess there is a reason why it is so cheap . 
it is not nice to have that portion tracked out . 
naughty dog and sony released crash bandicoot ,  which rivaled the likes of mario and sonic . 
not to mention all my kids turned out to be . 
this holster will not fit a glock num_num sf gen num_num firearm . 
i bought this to replace that one thinking it would give me more support that the $ one . 
i see a definite design flaw here ,  but it looks like when they do work ,  they work well . 
she has never gone back to it even when extremely bored . 
in the past months i had bought two more from other seller . 
i had to go back to my acne soap and the chemical peels . 
i use lush razorantium and it is far superior . 
i guess that is what i am going to have to buy again . 
i will just use this cloth to clean my computer screens . 
i returned it even though it looked cute . 
at one time ,  i was on hold for num_num min . 
it was ok tasting but not enjoyed enough to try again . 
so ,  zero stars as a product to cook food in . 
i think i ll leave this kind of thing to the professionals !  . 
they are only slightly larger than the breath freshener strips . 
but ,  if you have a sense of smell at all ,  avoid this cable . 
the problems ,  though ,  are too numerous to overlook ,  and i won t be playing it again . 
this carrier has an obvious flaw in that it creates more of a sail . 
plus ,  you get a year s supply of brush heads . 
i didn t mind the greasy feeling of it . 
i do not recommend this product at all . 
because of it s coloring ,  it also makes the poop more obvious . 
thought i could watch videos from youtube on this phone ,  oops ,  not a chance . 
that also means that you re not gonna be able to get all the bubbles out . 
the demo made it painfully obvious that splinter cell isn t worthy to scrape the grime from under mgs s toenails . 
i thought it might be the distance to the antenna  at the car rear  . 
some reviewers praised it and others thought it is a piece of chinese junk . 
so ,  although the primary purpose of this toy is vanity ,  i like the creative and artistic aspect of it . 
i should have paid attention to the num_num star comments . 
we own several older chicago cutlery knives and have been satisfied with them . 
i have had several mundi wallets and all were well made and lasted a long time . 
i like the whole concept of the case a lot more than i liked the case itself . 
i bought a facemaster and it works much better and can be used all over the face . 
he didn t really like using this when we were training him for puppy pads . 
it smells awful ,  the scent is wayyy to strong and smells like something a granny would wear . 
however for the money and certain situations this is a great lens to own and carry . 
we have had zero issues with connecting to our phones ,  and it pairs up nicely every time . 
so even if you managed to get a few clustery snacks ,  it was just granola stuck together . 
you could have at least given us something good and not a clunky black box with dvd playback . 
the new crisps looks like they kept them in the oven for an hour too long . 
that had my dog leaping around like a puppy the next day . 
this is by far the easiest humidifier i ve had to refill . 
i have had to return the under warranty machine and get another more times than i care to count . 
i ordered num_extend and it fits me perfectly and is very comfortable for maybe half a day . 
i tried to weigh her several times on this scale ,  and she consistently weighed num_extend pounds . 
that is ,  if you can get them to work . 
i play guitar and my thin nails take a beating ,  so i ve tried several products . 
the potential for good quality is there ,  but one of the combs was severely deformed . 
maybe it can t be called fraud as a legal charge ,  but it s certainly misrepresentation . so to be blunt . 
this is not the rubbery type of nylabone . 
these idiots didn t think of that and considering this design is a higher risk application ,  leaks ,  overheating etc . 
way too concentrated w way too much stevia . 
this version of toss across is just not the same as the one i enjoyed as a kid . 
let me first say that the company is friendly and easy to work with . 
i did try it again after using aubrey for a while and i was very disappointed . 
a couple months later ,  the plastic underneath the fine grater broke off . 
i could hear faint high pitched sound when placed to my ear but dogs didn t . 
i would not recommend anyone waste their money on this product that s being distributed by amazon . 
all this with a very readable display and small enough to keep in your shirt pocket . 
or maybe it s just a bad translation ?  all in all ,  not really worth the bother . 
super stiff leather ,  and the shaft of the boot ,  which is suede ,  did not seem well made . 
i tried this out with my dog last night and was expecting miracles according to the other reviews . 
the low grips are too low and the top ones are too high . 
they won t rub on it ,  despite my adding organic num_extend party catnip to it . 
my picky cat would not eat ?  i m sure the product is good but she would t eat it . 
i usually mix some real sugar with stevia . 
we also noticed an effect on tabu ,  our num_num year old rescued feral . 
we try going to the dr first and take the pills he prescribed with no luck . 
they told me  we put these in all of our bikes .   ok ,  so they last me about four months . 
i think i payed like $ for it so whatever . 
the color was so vivid at the first sight ,  but . 
the first two types ,  from different manufacturers have been great . 
these are too expensive for a % failure rate !  . 
don t be fooled by promises of beachy looking waves ,  or any sort of waves for that matter . 
it makes me want to ship it back . 
oh goodie ,  something else to recharge and keep up with . 
you could probably get a cheap stone set at a camping store and get better results . 
the bunnies have never performed consistently since we got the game . 
nor does the software allow you to create a separate folder for each recorded program . 
we got these for christmas for my three year old . 
now this one even with this years new computer  ,  massive memory and top of the line video card . 
my num_extend walmart binoculors were better than this expensive piece of equipment . 
i have had two sets of these given my kids at different times and they were a big disappointment . 
usually takes at least num_num to num_num attempts to get even a moderate seal . 
the age factor on this toy is very wrong . 
pictures taken to be stitched at medium to maximum shift will not match in luminosity . 
like nintendo couldn t have possibly ok d a game that uses one button . 
i m sure there are very good copies of this lens ,  i just didn t get one of them . 
these are cute boots ,  however ,  ,  ,  ,  , the right boot was at least one size smaller than the left boot . 
i seriously can t believe how well this product is rated . 
six weeks later my knee is still healing and my right arm is a long way from being right . 
my wife is very sensitive to sleep aids  medical or  natural  . 
i m not sure how this has so many good reviews . 
i am fairly new to the bunny world and have been doing a lot of research . 
none of my friends could use this pump at all . mounting is good though . 
do not buy this unless you are one of the above ddr fanatics . 
amazon is still the best place to buy them ,  but just make sure what you really want first . 
it looks cool but isn t a practical choice for a kid . 
both the car and wall charger broke easily . 
i gave this num_num stars just because she can get it down . 
because then the whole unit would be rock solid . 
and when you open a bag don t be surprised to find mostly broken pieces inside instead of whole crisps . 
the gameplay is the same as ever and it gets very repetitive and dull . 
so far i had num_num gamesharks ,  both of which were defective . 
the four stars missing is for the worst quality i ve ever seen in my life . 
but .  .  .  .  .  .  . i purchased this to just leave in the car to use during an emergency . 
or if your focus is ssb ,  get the grundig yacht boy num_extend
second time of applying this product ,  it got worse . 
i tried unsuccessfully for a half day to uncurl four of these . 
it might agree with others and it looks like a quality product . 
the ones they now make are made out of a totally different kind of glass . 
it has been out for a year now and there have been no reports of the unit overheating . 
spend the extra money for chargers that last . 
this product shows as a nude lipstick pencil . 
i d never played a mgs game before ,  started with this one . 
i really wush it was num_extend or more longer . 
this thing has just been a pain and i can t wait to get rid of it . 
worth buying it ,  but don t pay more than $
i love the storage box but you have to line it up just right for it to snap on . 
i got so frustrated ,  i was about to throw this thing out of the window . 
i guess people believe what they are told . 
i saw some complaints about this and dismissed them . 
the only draw back is that the cord doesn t retract . 
a really special feeling using this very big num_extend
i have to say ,  these are the worst granola bars i ve ever had . 
this is a good looking case but it provides poor protection . 
however ,  it made my face break out into small white heads . 
my decision was cemented when it stopped working after one day of use . 
you don t need this processed horrible tasting things . 
first time my cat tried to play with it  in seconds  ,  it fell down on top of my cat . 
i want to love it because it is easy to apply and the smell is mild . 
long time before expiration .  .  .  .  . but buying these single from this company was not goo good . 
he s only num_num so is too young based on the suggested age however the construction quality here is bogus . 
i took one dump in num_num days and just dropped a few pebbles in that time frame . 
it was not a very helpful or convenient product . 
iodex is becoming both increasingly scarce and expensive . 
so i was hoping this would work to help me cope better with that . 
we are exchanging it for another brand of litter box . 
the product inside the bottle would get num_num stars if i could get to it . 
first ,  the cops are way too good for this game ,  even better than the first . 
now ,  i ve played the later iterations of phantasy star ,  and i loved them . 
these are the reasons : the doll has fabric legs that in my opinion will get dirty after awhile . 
piece of carp that keeps falling apart and the lens is blurry . 
did not get much use out of this one . 
i didn t have heartburn with this coffee but i didn t like the flavor . 
it also stings my eyes ,  i will not purchase again . 
these are very sweet and crumble a lot . 
it doesn t hold up to simple dropping and handling . 
this is an inferior phone with tons of issues . 
just because it has a canon logo on it does not make it a great purchase . 
this game seemed to be perfect in premise; discover the city filled with zombies and fight in it . 
this is still way to light for my skin . 
i really thought this tool would be quicker than using the magnetic wand . 
this particular flavor seemed to give them all diarrhea though ,  sadly . 
i had my skepticism due to the size of sticks yet was advertised for large dogs . 
no extra space in the bowl to prevent over flow . 
was not what i thought it was going to be . 
i had high hopes for this organic popcorn . 
it lasted through num_num uses ,  with a burning smell . 
strange ,  but when i pay for something ,  i expect value for money . 
and the buttons are more difficult to press and it is not musical . 
i received my moustache comb and scissor and was immediately struck by the shoddy quality of them . 
i order the brown ,  thinking i had ordered black . 
i clean and maintain it meticulously so that is not the issue . 
first i d like to note that the first splinter cell was a very enjoyable game . 
i guess i will just keep it for backup . 
otherwise ,  be a wiz kid before you think about installing this yourself . 
the sound :  why won t the announcers shut up ?  ? i m not gonna even bother rating this on my usual scales . 
i ordered a num_num but dont know if ordering a size bigger would make a difference in the width . 
i keep it in the fridge to cool it as i do most of my eye creams . 
it s about as slick as it gets and is always slipping out of my hand . 
i am usually very pleased with products received from amazon . 
update num_extend i sent watch back to seller who credited my credit card with purchase amount and shipping . 
the graphics are great ,  but the level design looks like it was inspired by star wars . 
it ended up wrecking my lock button and i had to send it in to get fixed . 
product seemed to dry very quickly when placed on face . 
the cable i received was way more thick as well as the body around the actual num_extend end . 
actually ,  this could be a good paring with seafood ,  because i sometimes detect a slight fishiness in the taste . 
it s ok ,  but it s not destined to be a family classic . 
i took a chance on these because of the size . 
this kit provides a false sense of security and is a waste of money . 
could never get our frenchie to use this . 
the screw that holds the bracket together rusted and now i need to change it with a stainless one . 
you drop it once  ,  that would be the end . 
tempted by the bose ,  but they re way too expensive . 
i bought this to sharpen my fiskers splitting ax and other knives . 
this is an utter failure as a product . 
the downside of this creatine is that it is the consistency of sugar but doesn t desolve as well . 
i ordered this headset since i broke my original that came with my nokia num_extend
due to it s design ,  it avoids the need to reconfigure . 
opticsale s price for both the brush and the handle is over $ together .

the game randomly pops up elements and items . 
and i try so hard to like it . 
the back wheels come out too far so our daughter was constantly tripping over them . 
i wound up tossing way too much of the bag ,  so the value was bad . 
this wasn t what i thought it was ,  and nowit s too late to return . 
for the price of this i expected better . 
socks with treads work much better and stay on the dogs feet .  .  . inside use only ,  however . 
it is not due to sediment accumulation ,  but a low g . p . m . 
the squirrels just helped themselves to food and left . 
i know i should have made a backup ,  but it still should not have num_extend
not two minutes later ,  it fell off again . 
it was functionally worthless ,  and not worth the cost to ship it back for a refund . 
usually ,  one of my three cats will eat the treats . 
but i ordered new product !  !  ! i ordered relaxed fit .

i got it as a gift from my son otherwise i would return it . 
sorry but these round brushes are terrible for me . 
i contacted the company and they weren t very cooperative . 
the wig i received is much shorter than shown and much darker in color . 
considering the size required for her small neck ,  the webbing is just too thick . 
we re looking into pyrex products for better satisfaction for our needs . 
they are also very loose and fall out easily ,  not that it matters . 
the bass strong and clean but not overpowering ,  crystal clear highs and exellent midrange from sats . 
both pieces are lightweight and junky ,  but they did not claim anything more . 
this is the worst product that i have bought online . 
after that ,  i think i ll be old enough to just not care anymore . 
i was so excited when i received this turner in the mail . 
so are corn syrup solids with fructose ,  which content is not provided on the label .

the speaker was ruined as it hit the floor and will need to be replaced . 
they will also grenade your armor in a group and take it out quickly . 
i had to drill out the hole to put it together .

stuffing treats inside isnt useful as they pop out too easily .

i m not spending $ for a radio antenna . 
maybe i am just not one of those people . 
yet the store was out of these so i picked up the most smilair board . 
i m not even able to play the game ,  the cd key isn t accepted even though it installs fine . 
like another reviewer posted ,  the cable seems pretty cheaply made . 
the material that they use is too  gummy  and any sort of pressure causes permanent lines on the surface . 
they were literally under my arms as i moved throughout my day . 
so for me it was a total waste of my money . 
i ll keep it but i m not real happy with it . 
i heard aloe vera does wonders for the skin and it many cases it cures acne . 
it s pretty small ,  not even big enough for either of my bigger cats . 
and just learned they have another few weeks to wait on that patch . 
a waste of money . if you need to buy a wok ,  don t get this one . 
i immediately co washed with a conditioner . i am returning this bottle to ulta ,  where i purchased from .

the thin plastic dome will warp and structurely distort in time due to heat and moisture from cooking . 
i ordered another one because he loves it so much . 
after reading everyone s reviews ,  i kind of feel bad that we did not have the same results . 
when this thing s battery died ,  i took it apart to figure out what went wrong . 
they send extra squeakers which are pointless when all that s left is a carcass . 
it had been about fifteen minutes since i d given the dog the bone . 
taking it with food might help it absorb into your body . 
the case wouldnt even snap on right in the first place . 
i was too busy to deal with it so i never sent it back . 
the fact that they used a num_extend camera is something that has me shaking my head . 
i tried to use this cord for the first time over the labor day weekend holiday with no results . 
the best one s are in the num_num or num_num pack ,  as they are really absorbent and do the job . 
essentially ,  you use the same three hit combo over and over . 
on the other hand this protector gets scratched very easily . 
this coffee should be described as bold ,  there is nothing light about it . 
in one ,  you will receive experience ,  and in the other you will receive items and enemy cards . 
this isn t a bag of broken or twisted pieces . 
that done you can consider whether to take saw palmetto .

if you are looking for something that cures toenail fungus this did not work for me .

this though is the main problem with this sequel . 
i ve also not noticed a difference in the texture of my skin . 
at work i have had num_num pairs of sennheiser headphones . 
the items purchased were fine ,  and delivered promptly . 
i will say though ,  that amazon has pretty amazing customer service . 
i have never had a similar problem with any other mouse . 
despite the ipodish design ,  this car connector adds noise to the sound . 
i m disabled and it will not capture a picture of even me walking past it . 
it is about the same size @ num_extend diameter . 
the left headphone popped off and a little piece of plastic went flying across the room . 
may work great for others but it s really messy going on and the color is not what i expected . 
i ll update if i do a trial of putting dairy back in my diet . 
i ve been using otterbox cases for a long time . 
if you like little green men ,  go for it . 
they cannot be contorted into positions that would allow versatile settings . 
the design part doesn t make up for the horrible game play . 
it would probably be a decent charger if it actually fit a nexus num_extend
i was looking for cuticle removed and tried this one out . 
hasnt broke yet and seems to work ,  but feels very cheap . 
this cheapie mic is is low ,  low ,  low quality . 
don t waste your money .  also ,  don t be a moron and tell sony you are using num_extend party cables  . 
nothing to review .  . its been seven days till now no clue . 
since the first one was defective ,  i sent both back for a refund . 
its a wonderful and very different locket .  .  . but the black tarnish is awful . 
pedal is not working ,  it just making noise . 
they are relatively comfortable ,  although i would definitely prefer an ear bud . 
i did nto realize there was something different about the box ,  but i could tell when i ate it . 
first off when you create your team you don t get to pick who your players are . 
this was a waste of time ,  energy and money !  . 
would have been great if the remote was wireless . 
if you re looking for a hot filter look no further than the emperor num_extend
and so on and so on and so on . 
it probably is a great product but not on my skin . 
i really had a bad experience with this product . 
the flower fell off immediately makes me think it was poorly constructed . 
we bought this for our num_num pound border terrier . 
of course ,  when i scooped it out it broke apart . 
this never happens with all the other brands i have used . 
this mole trap was very difficult for us to set . 
the objects are cool ,  but dont add much . 
i arch my brows upwards but my natural brows tend to slope downwards . 
the others have an immediate coconut odor and flavor . 
the flipper is very thin and bends too easy when you try to pick up food from the pan . 
indestructible . skip these ,  no matter how cute they are !  mb . 
half ass job and not worth the wait it took to receive . 
i love ginger teas so i was pretty excited to give this one a try . 
the star bursts could not be adjusted to cover the target . 
i recently bought a few packs of jazz iiis and i was shocked . 
i d almost rather replace the microwave than spend another $ on this . 
i can t imagine why so many people say they love it . 
if you find the perfect balance spot ,  don t move . 
even after reading a few negative reviews ,  i ordered this anyway ,  likely based on the name brand . 
i bought this to entertain my kid during a long flight . 
mainly because a friend of mine has one of these and his actually worked . 
i tried to return them but the sellers  not amazon  wouldn t take them back . 
i have given her cheaper stuffed toys that take her just as long if not longer to pull apart . 
if i want a sweet dish ,  i ll add the sugar myself . 
balls gt stuck in hippos heads jamming them up . 
so why would anyone pay over num_num bucks . 
do yourself a favor and buy either game from the ratchet and clank series . 
 i guess i expected a glossy little insert from the popular joola company . 
well it s been exactly num_num days and the light bulb already burned out . 
i ve bought at least a dozen including every logitech model except the most recent . 
if you buy name brand batteries of this type they could cost you over ten dollars for the pair . 
that said ,  the fragrance was so strong that i couldn t stand to use it . 
the shake things with the metal in them are nice ,  we walk around the house shaking them ,  dancing . 
it has tags that seem awkward ,  would be better if it was tag less . 
both holders didn t stick and ended up on the floor . 
i would actually give this backpack num_num stars if the zipper hadn t fallen off  on two of their backpacks  . 
my cat loves this toy so much ,  he would wake me in the morning with it in his mouth . 
first ,  i always felt like i ended up slouching ,  vice the promised good posture . 
so i bought it and when i received it i was extremely disappointed . 
that was it !  less than what a num_num year old does . 
if you just want very fast food out of your own kitchen ,  there have got to be better alternatives . 
sometimes you would be behind your character as in any other third person perspective game . 
this is far too much ,  and ea really needs to fix this recurring problem in their potter games . 
and on fourth day in addition to the tracking problem ,  hitting certain notes caused a low pitch fluttering noise . 
too bad ,  it smelled good !  i would like to add a picture but i cannot find an upload button . 
after inserting i thought it was the next best thing since mac and cheese !  i couldn t feel a thing . 
but as others noted ,  the suction cup falls off the glass in the shower all the time . 
most canned pet food contains carrageenan ,  even the high end brands . 
flimsy ,  wobbly ,  and grabs only the lightest item if at all . 
i bought them for the gym but they are so uncomfortable ,  i just tossed them . 
the pads for your legs are made of cheap foam and far to small . 
at times ,  it does not connect to my phone properly . 
completely disappointing since we did not use it in any extreme manner . 
it worked best if my intention was to suck down all my coffee at once ,  scalding hot . 
as a consumer ,  it is my right to know what ingredients are in the products i buy . 
the product worked ok for one of my daughters and didn t work at all for the other one . 
sure ,  it s fun  and almost surreal  to see nightmare zero chasing you . 
count on num_extend stops maybe ,  if not ,  num_extend
this one is very ,  very ,  hard to swallow with a glass of anything . 
overall i was disappointed in how reliable it was . 
it is rather a bit spicy and has a strong aftertaste . 
i was expecting them to be smaller granuals then what they came as . 
this product was constructed so cheaply that it came apart even before first use . 
white face city whenever i put this on . 
compare that to the versatality of cf cards at much lower price . oh . 
costs more than a whole bunch of seedling tomato num_extend
i sleep with a cap on to protect my hair and my pillows from the oil . 
the replacement i received  amazon very quickly sent me a replacement  didn t make whole ,  usable waffles . 
these have a freshness date of dec num_extend
what i didn t want was a copy cat . 
this is fine because should you dare stop building your national monument to aardvarks % city defense vs . 
i went to write a review and amazon told me i already wrote one . 
it saddens me to see a company s quality decline this way . 
it also rubbed on the top of my second toe and abraded that area . 
i may donate mine to a rescue or shelter . 
also ,  note that it contains msg equivalent  yeast extract is chemically equivalent to msg  . 
gerber was my brand years ago when they were made in the u . s . a . 
what it does not do is provide a practical way of doing so . 
several hours later i got the most horrendous stomach cramps imaginable . 
this was suppose to be a christmas gift !  . 
i have to say that i misinterpreted what this product was . 
sega s espn nhl hockey num_extend isn t the great hockey game that it was last year . 
i will have to look for another way to remove the gel nail polish . 
samurai warriors is a hack n slash game for the xbox . 
the  soap  is as thin as dirty dish water . 
the machine will not always turn off when you press the power button . 
very annoying to look at but functionally it is a good space saver and very convenient . 
but mainly my complaint is that this isn t very sudsy . 
he only used each bodysuit once or twice at most . 
my golden retriever shredded this in no time at all . 
the ball that lights up didn t do much difference . 
the packaging was poor and this product was open and had spilled everywhere . 
these were hard to stay in and when they did ,  well they are worthless for me . 
way too narrow even though i ordered a d !  . 
two of these would make nice book ends . 
not to mention ,  this just doesn t absorb odors the way i hoped it would . 
i threw out the smelly rug and got a new one . 
she just kept barking ,  even though i pointed it right at her from only a couple feet away . 
over this winter i ve been getting small field mice in my garage looking for a warm place to stay . 
num_num hours into oblivion a friar  npc  was not following me anymore as he was suppose to be . 
i am having pain behind my eyes and in my right side of my face . 
but ,  we don t even have to go that far . 
and it just makes my skin feel slimy later ,  which i would tolerate if there was any shine reduction . 
however ,  the way it is now ,  i wouldn t ever purchase this product again . 
my sister said they were a bit bland . 
the french onion dip wasn t too bad either . 
oh well i ve bought some other wonderful panties here . 
it was hard to get off and left too many streaks . 
i m about to commit an act of treason against men everywhere . 
i don t want to waste a great experience while this game is so buggy . 
i can t even return it now because amazon says it s considered hazardous waste . 
this was not a pc game but a poorly executed console port . 
not the quality in gold toe socks i expected . 
i was excited at first at how well these headphones did at noise canceling . 
i have been trying to avoid artificial sweetners and thought that i had found just what i wanted . 
there is one overpowering flavor ,  i don t know what it is . 
this deal was put together by somebody with big brass ones . 
 and ,  of course ,  you can also boil it in a saucepan on the stove .   refrigerate it . 
i purchased this because many people had luck using it with their toyota num_extend
my order arrived promptly and in good condition . 
anything truly liquid in nature is totally not an option . 
throw grenades at you and you won t know who killed you . 
it really did not clean the wheels as suggested . 
the last screen protector i bought lasted over a year . 
this controler was not exactly good to me . 
the manual itself is as confusing as trying to read it in spanish . 
certainly not enough to do anything for your hair . 
and there are just some things that make it obvious it was kind of rushed to market . 
other questions still haunt me ,  with no answers to be found . 
i purchased this cable to replace my standard rgb hookup for my num_extend
surely ,  it was the worst one on the nintendo gamecube . 
because the ball remains squishy without being deflated he loves to gnaw it . 
i like my toast very lightly toasted and this toaster does just fine for that . 
not only did it hurt like  insert word  ,  it barely took any hair with it . 
this little fan  works  but for how long ?  i can t believe how cheaply it is made . 
he s finally able to use it and actually enjoys it . 
in this game ,  you are glorified for senseless acts of cruelty . 
the cat still has the ability to bite when cutting nails . 
it comes as a bunch of tiny extremely thin pressed bits in tiny bags . 
glass; other times num_num or more squirts were needed . 
the surface is so reflective that it renders your screen virtually useless . 
not sure what went wrong but does not fit color was ugly not as shown on the website . 
i started noticing dry itchy patches on my cheeks and forehead . 
no way that would ever fit over any pair of shows i own . 
then ,  i would install nylon zippers or velcro ,  to keep the items in the pockets . 
i loved the tactical aspects and the real life feel of being in the battlefield . 
thanks for letting me try something new winterparkhoney !  !  !  . 
i thought it was defective but i saw no chips in the frame of the attachment . 
however with my num_extend num_extend though this can be an issue . 
do not buy even if it for $
i have never really cared much for granola so i thought i d see what they would do with chocolate . 
also ,  their voices aren t right ,  and i hate them . 
spare yourself the pain and embarassment and leave you gorgeous hair alone ladies . 
my first gut reaction was that it tasted like a combination of saccharin and alkaseltzer  that old cold medication  . 
i didnt know this was a cream ,  i thought it was a powder . 
it would have been a five star review . 
i have a small num_extend dog and she could not fit in this at all . 
when i pressed the release button ,  it expanded but would not fit the phone and lock anymore . 
they need better descriptions and a way to contact the vendor for questions . 
the necklace that s attached to the shirt wasn t hanging right and you can t take it off to fix it . 
i m very disappointed ,  but i m hoping the suction will stay on my windshield . 
this was my second case purchase off amazon in my quest for a case for my white iphone num_extend
i will not be purchasing these products again . 
there is no reason to buy this filter over the num_extend classic num_num external canister filter  ?  num_extend
i measured these new hanes size num_num against a new fruit of the loom brief size num_extend
i would not trust this to leave it alone toasting anything . 
there is absolutely no logical reason i can think of for this . 
the problem is the unit is poor quality . 
i bought two of these when i set up the new finch cage . 
could work for nighttime ,  but i use cotton gloves and these are just too bulky for overnight . 
the last thing i want is  uncle milton  in my room ,  his moon ,  included . 
for a coffee maker to only work num_num months ,  it is junk . 
i applied this product overnight to dry a spot . 
not good for long time companies like hanes . 
not great ,  but that s my opinion ,  some might like it more than i did . 
i wanted all num_num to be black ,  so i ll order from the jockey site ,  maybe there better there . 
i didn t get any noticeable reduction in sweating and now i have chafed pits . 
maybe if they add some caffeine to the mix . 
the other brands are more of a fillet stamped out and canned . 
one was in the skb fender case $ on amazon  ,  the other in this gator case purchased locally . 
the knife issue didn t bother me as much as the response that i got from customer service . 
the hype ad does not state anywhere what the dha and epa are . 
the radio chatter ,  although nice at first ,  gets very annoying ,  very fast . 
also ,  the fact is simply painted on top to rub off with repeated use . 
the unit will barely keep room at % and the built in humidistat is about % off . 
this bowl looks good and matches some other things that i have in my kitchen . 
i haven t gotten past the first level because the controls are so bizzare in this game . 
as metioned ,  the spring tension seems minimal and is apparently not up to the task . 
they do not bounce at all and aren t smooth plastic like regular ping pong balls . 
it seems lots of customers like this foundation ,  but i m not a fan . 
stick with the sprout or happy baby meals . 
 just as a note ,  i m a female with light skin and very course hair  . 
other mandolin s have a dial for adjusting the width . 
if it does and i have to replace it every num_num months ,  i m going to be upset . 
i have crossed playtex off my list forever and will stick with glamorize bras . 
this is the highest quality glass you can get for bakeware . 
better spend a few dollars more and get the real thing . 
i couldn t get them to stay in my ears . 
the manufacturer should redesign the product s insides to prevent this kind of assembly error . 
blew up the second time i used it . 
perhaps on the first pair i owned ,  i over tightened the over the shoe strap ,  stressing them . mark  :   . 
i thought the philips clip headphones would be a great deal . 
i d say ,  don t waste your time with this ,  or your money . 
if i wanted a shoot em up game i would have bought quake num_num arena . 
remove and rinse thoroughly again with hot water for several minutes . 
sometimes an action rpg can be fun ,  like oblivion . 
i ve been using skincare with parabens for num_num or so years ,  and they haven t hurt me yet . 
i was hoping with noise assassin that it would sound better than me talking into the phone itself . 
these are just a bad product at least in south florida . 
i even typed in the model name and number in a google search site and found the same complaint . 
the glass broke at the neck of the bottle . 
i think it still has the vibrators in there instead . 
the rest of mine went into the trash . 
i bought this as a present for my mother when it was on a deal of the day special . 
don t like them and my cats don t either . 
i decided to purchase this after relocating to the dry areas of california . 
i have very damaged hair and this product made my hair even worse . 
i m amazed at all the people who ve given this three plus stars even though they ve broken multiple units . 
i was stoked about the previous reviews so i took a chance on this . 
i got it this morning and used it twice . 
after three days of normal use ,  the sound became distorted ,  and crackled . 
this screen is advertised as an exact fit . 
oh and you can play num_extend games on the num_extend for those of you who don t know that . 
just dont like that i have to buy a new one again so soon . 
sigh .  . if it doesn t work ,  i m giving up totally on littermaid . 
i couldn t believe that this had something to do with this product; it seemed so unlikely . 
my bluetooth device is the jawbone era ,  and these ear gels didn t fit that model . 
the little sucker is a great idea ,  but dang there are some sharp edges . 
and those plusses do not even begin to compensate for iw s many and deep flaws . 
my husband and i both love hot cider ,  but these taste watery and don t have much spice at all . 
gonna order soon but i hope it doesnt have a scratch . 
you just slide down the hills until you reach the finish . 
either way ,  they have goo to help wash the feathers down . 
i have chronic systemic candida and adrenal fatigue . 
there s no good reason for a dungeon crawl to take that long . it s a common problem among modern games . 
i love otterbox and i ve been using defender cases for num_num years . 
it turned itself on while in my briefcase ,  got extremely hot ,  and completely locked up . 
you turn the box over and all the shells fall out of their holes and start making a racket . 
but then he felt he was shouting the whole time . you do need the leapter explorer handheld to begin with . 
i am afraid that if i don t handle it gently ,  it will break in my hands . 
there is a new  nfl superstar  mode ,  which seems pretty cheezy . 
i purchased the cow first and used it for several months . 
i tried this as part of the vine program . 
the taste isn t all that bad ,  it does have an eggy flavor to it though . 
from what i can see ,  no one else carries them . 
they all are way to large in the cup size . 
original reviewi bought this to prevent my cat from going out the dog door and it works great . 
it is now very sweet with almost a syrup texture . 
they are awesome and boy do they stay . 
i bought an htc num_extend and booted android to it and it works beautifully . 
i really couldn t finish an entire bar in one sitting . 
the predominate flavor is strawberry ,  with a hint of watermelon . 
i checked the reservoir and it was full ,  tried disassembling it and reassembling it ,  but to no avail . 
can not even imagine if these were not sweetened . 
until then ,  just buy a nice regular vaccum . 
bought these for my tennis ball loving golden retriever . 
upon opening the package it was pretty flimsey and i didn t think it would hold up walking . 
but if your battery is a year or more old this will probably offer some improvement . 
out the num_num cans i received ,  there were about num_num cans that were dented pretty badly . 
not easy to clean and food sticks to it . 
a homerun feels the same as a single . 
i m much rather do this myself at home . 
i will not buy another cuisinart combo blender again . 
the dj controls this game boasts about are only ok at best . 
i bought the velbon num_extend when it first came out a couple of years ago . 
it would take years to use up all that syrup some of which i don t think i d ever use . 
to see that the price jumped up $ more dollars was shocking . 
all it will bring is disappointment to your child . 
it s hard to believe titus could have screwed up this game so badly . 
it uses a whooping num_extend filter ,  yet its maximum aperture is nothing to write home about . 
they smell so bad that they take your breath away when you open them . 
it s also much brighter than it needs to be ,  and flashes red with any vibration  including music  . 
learning to use enough is the trick there though . 
i am generally a huge fan of sunbeam products ,  especially their heating pads . 
wrangler needs to make sure the sizes are correct !  . 
made from cheap plastic and imperfection is highly visible after applying polish . 
i found this mode to be a pain for obvious reasons . 
and i now use it on my hands . 
had this rush shipped overnight to save my brand new galaxy player num_extend this won t work . 
had this been disclosed in the description ,  i d have no gripe with this puzzle . 
let s pray they don t use this graphics engine on num_extend
button mashing was invented by lazy game developers . 
i own the first two socom games ,  i love them too ,  despite the mild glitches and such . 
it still works at the moment ,  but once grease is gone its days are numbered . 
if it goes out ,  the knife is nothing more than a paperweight . 
with this product ,  your hair not only looks awful ,  it feels disgusting too . 
the time it takes me to get to town but nothing . 
to each his or her own ,  but i recommend another soap  flavor .   . 
i tried washing and drying them thoroughly ,  but that only helped for an hour or so . 
the first unit lasted about two hours before it stopped working completely . 
it is going in the give away bag . 
i have extremely oily sensitive skin and was afraid that it would make me break out . 
this is a game machine !  !  !  !  !  !  it is for playing games . 
it s not far off from nails on a chalkboard . so far ,  i only really use it to toast . 
i will use it ,  but i am not thrill . 
the squeaker is in the head ,  and there s only one . 
amazon ,  as usual ,  took them back with no questions . 
in couple ways ,  enter the matrix is a visionary ,  unprecedented first for video games . 
if they were a lot cheaper i would ,  but at this price it s not worth it . 
to order only one more was the only luck at this purchase . 
it became sticky very quickly and provided very poor lubrication . 
it is no longer silver and my finger turns green . 
not going to waste any more time on it . 
soybean meal is a poor quality protein filler . 
you can get updated drivers on the website ,  but the main website listed in the software does not work . 
the reviews on the sony are positive so i thought i d try it . this headset works quite well . 
i cannot tell you what on earth the smell is ,  but it smells so bad .

the oil absorbing feature is an added benefit !  . 
my son does like to stand and play and push the buttons . 
hey ,  my bad ,  i should have paid attention to what company was shipping what .

it is glued to the keyboard and to the front surface and is quite a pain to remove . 
letting it set had little effect ,  so i eventually gave up and just ate it . 
this device is perfect for a larger group . 
at the same time ,  they looked tough for the cats to chew . 
it would connect and stay connected ,  but would not download anything . 
after you ve completed all the missions you move on to the next city with tougher missions  and more money  . 
they were very large on my leg ,  and loose from bottom to top . 
the texture is kind of powdery and is as light as paper . 
came opened and spilled all over package . tryed a little of left over . 
i figured this would translate to better reception . 
it freezes when the level is too big or there s too much action hapening  which is always  .

spout didn t want to deploy from the bottle ,  finally got it with tons effort . 
i read about this and it sounded great . 
i found this too hard and it did put pressure on my tail bone .

i double ,  triple ,  and quad checked the fit to make sure ,  but it was definitely the fans . 
the newman s own peppermints are very poor quality ,  hardly any peppermint taste . 
belkin does make good products but this one is a miss . 
i passed it on to a relative because i needed a larger one . 
it might have worked ,  but a placebo is broken once you arent convinced it isnt doing what it says . 
when i found it on amazon for a much cheaper price i happily ordered it . 
the face tracking feature is very much useless . 
fabric and desing are excelent ,  but size is for fat people . 
now the back cover barely stays on which means the phone turns off all the time . 
i took the plastic off on it because i couldn t use my screen at all with it on . 
it s poorly made  in china of the cheapest plastic i ve seen . 
then the jars would not fit back into the rack . 
when you touch the case of the ipod the high freqeuncy whine goes away . 
there is just a bit of a bitter taste to them . 
the makers didn t even try to improve it .

horrible fit on all of the carnival corsets i have tried . 
i take quite a few meds with the side effect of constipation . 
she was able to put the cars on the tracks at num_num months .

their toys challenged dogs on an intuitive ,  not human though ,  level . 
unfortunately ,  my num_num month old golden retriever tore it apart in one day . 
this headset frequently drops the bluetooth connection to my phone even when it is only a few feet away . 
there really isn t much freedom to wonder around . 
after popping one of these into my rezound ,  there phone would boot up and shut right back down . 
i m returning them because i don t think they ll be warm enough with the tight fingers . 
seems to put a strain on too many parts of my body . 
i ve made hundreds of amazon purchases over the years and have relied heavily on customer reviews . 
whatever i m cleaning ends up with loose bristles all over them . 
but that s why its worth renting ,  not buying . 
i compared it to inexpensive apps i was using on the iphone num_extend
lotrimin cures ringworm and blue star will just make it not itch . 
looks and feels like any cheap pair you can get in chinatown .

the amp is a cheap piece of junk . 
the only increase i saw was on the scale . 
if you ping the router ,  it typically drops over half the packets . 
when you push the plunger ,  there is a mix between carnival tunes and loud suction like a blow dryer . 
i haven t played this game much yet  i guess that says it all  ,  but here s my impression so far . 
i bought this game a few days ago because my pirated copy of knockout kings num_num was malfunctioning . 
i have difficulty using the remote except sitting down on the couch in front of the player . 
on an airplane ,  however ,  the right earphone produced an earsplitting whine . 
the only plus  which gained it an extra star  was that i like the smell . 
it broke the minute i tried to adjust my sights . 
i bought this because it had many positive reviews . 
i didn t miss any steps or try to do it without reading the instructions ,  though . 
gmo soy caused sterility by the num_extend generation in two studies done on lab animals . 
it doesn t smell bad and you don t need much of it . 
this unit is cute ,  easy to install ,  and easy to use . 
i really thought ,  that after some time ,  it gets better . 
went to install the stock rail and when i did the front screw held . 
i took the entire pkg of these pearls . 
my daughter was very disappointed with the product . 
i wish we could give negative stars for a piece of dreck like this . 
i make a point of only buying games where the demo works on my box  and i like it  . 
i sharpened it which makes it better but not as good as others i ve used . 
my ears are still ringing from my bowlful . 
the sellers markup on this product must be tremendous . 
once in place ,  it squishes out of your dentures all over the outside . 
i rented this game on num_extend because i don t have a num_extend
half of the time i have to enter the code twice . 
i have num_num indoor cats and this is never a perfect fit . 
bottom line ,  don t waste your money on this garbage !  .

bought from amazon back in april num_extend didn t try to use it until just recently . 
not sure why microsoft has not stopped this company from selling this damaging product . 
when you get some mascara on your lashes ,  it winds up all clumpy . 
it looks like it was supposed to be for and iphone or something . 
drains my phone and my phone sometimes will not connect with it . 
they even sat on it and it held up . 
we ve owned several of these toys and they last a long time before getting destroyed . 
whoever designed this bag probably didn t use it . 
doesn t come with any sort of belt or restraint ,  this is really just an expensive booster seat . 
it is not that repeat playable in its current configuration and offers no value for my money . 
the noise is not just distracting ,  it is maddening . 
i have a metrokane rabbit wine opener that i love . 
while this is called a num_num inch spatula ,  that num_num inches includes the handle . 
not only that there are a ton of extra benefits with chamomile . 
who doesn t keep a case on their iphone ?  . 
it still upset my stomach ,  so still to much acid !  . 
day one this liner fades and smudges on my eyelids and waterline . 
sometimes red is a little hard to see so the green is a nice option to have . 
tried to hook this up to an apple tv for digital audio and could not make it work . 
some of the time a bottle on its side won t leak ,  but it is just a likely to leak . 
instead it confines the pee and keeps it off my dog s paws . 
basically it s a worthless product for someone who enjoys the game and the challenge of sudoku . 
no ,  it wasn t too tight ,  i ve been dealing withthem for years . 
not expelkin ,  but it turned out that kinivo num_extend was better for audio calls over this . 
wore the men s shoe for the first time on may num_extend num_extend
nothing like the quality of older record players like the webcor . 
the creatures scream in agony as you repeatedly flame them . 
i m so very disappointed ,  i don t like throwing money away as i live on social security . 
their packing is terrible and everything has arrived broken . 
second ,  the flavor combination here doesn t knock me off my feet ,  like the raspberry chipotle variety . 
but ,  sadly this game disappoints those true fans to the show . 
i ordered this sponge thinking it was the real beauty blender . 
that limitation essentially ruins the static routing feature ,  as by default ,  all traffic goes to the wan port . 
they ll go to into the trash easy enough !  . 
the money is not the issue ,  it is the time and effort spent that just burns me up . 
seriously ,  the color of the stocking material is almost laughable its so yellow . 
and the weird material of the watch band makes your wrist start to perspire almost immediately . 
i came back with soaking wet feet again . 
i dread the job for days before i finally have to make myself clean them . 
i just ordered num_num orders of those num_extend bolts total  for only $ after shipping . hope this review helps . 
the other water fountain by this company never had a issue like this one does . 
were nt expensive but u could save your money and get better satisfaction from buying a cup of coffee !  . 
since the cost was nearly nil  other than a couple of bucks for shipping  ,  i did not pursue replacement . 
make me think ,  let me solve puzzles ,  not just bash things ,  it gets old very fast . 
i had to unplug the computer and start it up again to get function . 
suddenly ,  you notice a jeep sitting out in the open ,  all alone . 
the plastic a but melted and it left blue streaks on one pan . 
but then again it was not expensive at all . 
monopoly has num_num times more interest ,  strategy and educational value than this dud . 
readings were all over the place way to touchy .  .  . i sent it back . 
% should still be enough to read for a bit ,  rather than going psycho and taking over the device . 
the pan is too shallow and it is difficult to get the cornbread sticks out of the pan . 
if i ran my fingers through my hair during the day ,  i lost a little more . 
well i never actually got a chance to use this toner . 
it was amazingly $ cheaper than the asking price you see now . 
so not only is it stinky but it wont do what it s suppose to do now . 
given amazon s great customer service i m sure i can return it but it s not really worth sending it back . 
i have used it only for light cleaning . 
looked forward to replacing my classic knife on my keychain because the scissor feature did not perform well . 
i purchased these binos because they appeared to be a good deal . 
this weed eater is no good at all . 
terrible product ! spa sister white cotton overnight moisture gloves . 
even warming in hands firstplus ,  true test for true argan oil is it is absorbed . 
even things like dove that has a fairly neutral scent . 
what was in there only lasted me a few weeks . 
i initially wrote a glowing review for this product but have done more research since . 
would all be better options that are in a similar price range . 
too bad ,  would rather have my fur child ingesting natural meds . 
i would say under num_num actually survived to be released . 
i will repeat num_num times ,  you get what you pay for ,  you get what you pay for . 
hey if u really are a starter go ahead and buy the thing .  .  . suckers . 
it also says that you need proof of purchase  pop  . 
or i d check and it d be sideways in the shoe . 
most complained about brightness ,  but otherwise said it was a cute flashlight and fine for use as a toy . 
second ,  the toast setting is determined by time ,  in whole minute increments only . 
on the fifth use ,  it started leaking in the coiled part of the tubing  on a bend  . 
nice fine pieces ,  bigger pieces ,  it s all under your control with the pulse buttons . 
in order to read it it clearly ,  i have to turn the watch to the side . 
it was hard to take it off ,  too . if you re picky when it comes down to fitment ,  look elsewhere . 
the plot ,  which is rather an unorganized one ,  also takes on some bizarre twists . 
seems like a good product ,  but for my fine ,  straight ,  oily hair it just didn t do the job . 
charging was constantly interrupted and i had to move the cable a bit so it would start charging again . 
it s kind of big for a backpacking tent anyway . 
someone ,  somewhere ,  cut a few too many corners on this product . 
but when cutting it tends to throw the clippings up rather then back into the catcher . 
gross !  so i thought i must not have cleaned it properly . 
i did nothing to rip it myself ,  just noticed a hole there in the ribbing . 
if this is true ,  then i blame the failure of this game on the lack of such a resource . 
more than i want my money back ,  i want those missed hours of my life back !  . 
the bra is absoltuely beautiful and the lace is pretty just fits terribly . 
i would take this back to the store if i could . 
i began adding num_num packs of stevia in the raw . 
i decided to work through the pain and ugliness and give the shoes at least a two day trial . 
i see no improvement of any kind and i ve been using this for a while . 
the iphone num_num does not fit all that great . 
it does make the iphone speaker sound louder . 
and the dirt cup is not what you might call large . 
i guess i just expected better . i did not test these outdoors so maybe there are good for that purpose . 
they use four aa batteries and have num_num watt of power output per speaker . 
loreal for some reason only packs a small tube of toner into the box . 
i am currently wearing the slippers that i thought were worn out ,  which is why i bought the isotoners . 
the coolest part is the polar bear slide . 
it isn t so bad that you couldn t play but it definitely gets annoying super fast . 
it s hard to use these type of clippers as opposed to a dremmel with a really wiggly puppy . 
also not enough pockets for cords ,  batteries ,  cables ,  etc . 
if i were to sneeze then people would see my hoo haw or anus because of the length . 
however the slightly thinner screen of the num_extend makes it easier to hold in my num_extend
don t buy if you re expecting a shimmery mocha ,  the shimmer doesn t really transfer to the eye at all . 
i was so impressed with it ,  i decided to try other toys from this brand . 
the mint creme flavor comes on too strongly ,  and makes the cookie just taste off . 
it s plastic inside and out with some type of reinforcing fiber woven through it . 
of course this game doesn t have online capabilites because it came out before xbox live was even released . 
i don t know where it came from ,  or what it was . 
i wouldn t recommend these and certainly wouldn t buy them again . 
usually every year i buy him a new one . 
it bugs me that so many of these reviews are fake methods of advertisement . 
waiting for the outcome ,  hopefully the phone will be really fixed this time . 
my hair is very silky and soft but it always is ,  so not what i was looking for . 
there are better harnesses that do the job better . 
i m thinking i may return this but i ll give it a couple days thought . 
i was able to get a nice even grind suitable for espresso . 
i was so disappointed and the kids were too . 
this is not a good deal and this jacket is cheaply made . 
the cuisinart is a very disappointing product if you know what can be produced for half the price . 
i immediately washed it off and applied an ice pack . 
not only that but my skin ended up being dryer the longer i used this lotion . 
the enemies vary in their quality but typically the bosses are very detailed . 
these bars presently sell in a box of num_extend $ per bar . 
even though you can speed through the walking it still is quite boring . 
this replacement pack used to work with braun series num_num num_extend model  and i ve ordered it multiple times . 
i would love to return this headset for one that would remain in place when i am moving around . 
with only one exception i was never quite pleased with the resulting beverage . 
she must be the mother to an elf . 
my conclusion is that the radio shack digital pocket radio that lists for $ is the better radio . 
you would have to have the thing next to your ear to hear it . 
i know a lot of nurses and others who are on their feet a lot wear these . 
if you live in an area with relatively few fm stations ,  this transmitter would be great . 
i found it did not to help after all of the pain it caused . 
however ,  in our tests in an old house ,  traditional snap traps continue to catch mice ,  and this one hasn t . 
i don t think i ll play this one again . 
this are veeeeeeeeeeeeeeery thin and just for a one day use . 
i called customer service to confirm that i d assembled it correctly . 
i thought this would be a great solution . 
they are better made and leave a car looking better than this product . 
i looked at the reviews and did some homework on the diamonds . 
however before it died ,  the screen kept turning blue with a message to hit the reset button . 
i can understand the point of the lock ,  but this thing is a piece of junk . 
also ,  of course ,  you can try feeding the toddle smoothies and juice rather than this formula with corn syrup . 
the graphics are ok and i am sure the game might even be fun . 
after transitioning him to the canidae ,  his stools were loose and yellow . 
he also has much greater range . my advice is to pay close attention to the reviews . 
vegetarian dog foods get higher scores . one of the top ingredients is animal fat . 
i have tried everything , now i will feed the deer , and give up on the garden !  . 
as a gardener ,  i m familiar with deer off . 
my pup has no interest in this toy . 
the cannons and line infantry in empire :  total war were epic to hear . 
the tubing is flimsy and of poor quality plastic . 
not only did it not do its pore minimizing namesake ,  it looked awful . 
these thinkthin bars do not have much flavor and have an unpleasantly gritty texture . 
it s like a big plastic bubble over the face of the phone ,  and it is very hard to use . 
i did not receive stockings with it ,  as some of the other reviews stated . 
my topeak ,  as well as my silca and zefal ,  had none of these issues . 
oh ,  and if you miss their birthday dont expect any help . 
this bra was so small i could not even get it on . 
some said they had adorama logo on them . 
unfortunately ,  the quality is not as good as in the past . 
we tried playing a couple times ,  but we all found it to be kind of boring . 
i made this with with small cup setting on my keurig ,  thinking it would be mild . 
after that ,  things went downhill pretty quickly . the next morning ,  i broke out the new griddle to make some pancakes . 
previously ordered a variety of think thin bars and never considered complaining about anything . 
i bought an $ pair of bushels num_extend right here on amazon for my kids to use . 
looks graet on paper and sounds like a great deal . 
i would have returned them ,  but my inside cats thought they were ok . 
the next morning i noticed my danios were sitting on the bottom of the tank . 
i put them on and can t wait to take them off . 
i have two corgis and they heard it . 
if you want to feed your dog a quality food ,  find something else . 
its inferior to the other brand and really isnt strong enough . 
how much would it have cost to add a slip of paper with instructions in the package ?  . 
after rings pulled out ,  i removed the scope and returned to iron sights . 
i didn t give this game a rating because i haven t played it yet . 
i should have bought halo when i had the chance . 
the next time ,  it stopped with one minute left and never rang . 
the only thing i would recommend about this product is for nunaturals to change back to their old formula . 
it s the way the outside plate is molded . 
think of the bike on the wizard of oz and you get the picture . 
skip the first teenage mutant ninja turtles game . 
it s a good concept , but needs have a larger capacity . 
after testing this glass on a sunny day i will update my review . 
it is the worst beauty product i ve ever purchased . 
i bought this after my bichon had a very serious bladder stones  calcium based  . 
after that it would not turnon ,  even after reformatting . 
if they won t play with it ,  no use buying them . 
i m disappointed in this toy because i have several other kong  squeaker  toys that have lasted years . 
great price for $ for an oem battery ,  however ,  i had a less than positive experience with the battery . 
plus ,  i really just can t recommend this game to anyone . 
the stuff was like $ for a tiny little bottle ,  and digested about as well as tree bark . 
it has a very small pump head and only pumps a very small blob of soap . 
this luggage scale doesn t work if you want to weigh a luggage that is about num_num pounds . 
i am returning the unit and looking for another one ,  probably not from plantronics . 
these are important distinctions to know when purchasing headphones . 
it is just not cost effective enough to return this for a warranty claim . 
i ordered this as a wedding band after we had been married a year . 
she really seemed to prefer to push around a jumbo sized pampers box . 
instead i got a form letter telling me that the rebate wasn t accepted . 
the wood on three of the pieces is completely cracked . 
my dog popped a hole in it within a week and he s a little dog . 
the aseptic container pictured resembles the num_num ounce cartons that i buy at the store . 
i purchased another one of these  solar system floor puzzle  but haven t opened it yet . 
i can t stand big chunks of flax seeds . 
what doesn t make it into the air builds up inside the vacuum parts ,  not the dust bin . 
it seemed to fade fast however ,  so i was hoping for something with better staying power . 
it does have some trouble focusing and is kind of  loud  focusing . 
when it is pushed around the house at a higher speed it is extremely loud . 
when i was new to the hobby ,  a few years ago ,  i purchased this skimmer . 
youtube showed some flying well and some having the same experience i did . 
 i will also add that i think it s bigger than i expected . 
i took a mule deer at num_num yards with a quartering toward shot . 
i expected spicy and the bag wasn t so i was turned off . 
quite how a piece of solid metal is meant to interface with a beam of light is beyond me . 
it almost makes you feel kind of sad . verdict ?  the wii has nothing going for it . 
ok ,  water resistance is great for beach trips . 
we precisely added the amount of water for soft boiled and they came out overdone . 
spend less and get real ,  raw shea in tubs big enough to not run out every week . 
when i took this brand of garlic oil ,  my upper arms down to the elbow would break out . 
i contacted uncle milton who said it could take longer in colder climates . 
i figured i would pick it up because of the num_extend price tag but that s about what it s worth . 
but then it was a crap shoot . sometimes it would brew the coffee ,  while other times it would not . 
we play it for maybe ten minutes and then all are bored . 
heads fall apart after a couple weeks of use . 
i am so mad that i don t even want to talk about it anymore . 
i personally don t think killing animals for leather is an ecologically responsible action . 
it had plastic shrinkwrap around it ,  but apparently it leaker during shipment . 
for value and good gaming that beats the gc go with the dreamcast . 
all of the games are to old to play on my pc . 
and forget the tiny trimmer ,  it is just too hard to use . 
this can be a pain because turning correctly is a bit of a challenge . 
right then and there i knew it was junk . 
i m not quite sure how to describe it .  . kind of grainy . 
i had heard such great things about this game but in all reality i found it very boring . 
i couldn t even swallow the bite of toast . 
the eggs will slid out without any effort and the clean up is easy . 
when i gave them tomy parrots they all went to hae a close up look and refused to eat . 
update august num_extend num_extend using the latest flash about a month ago ,  the router is far more stable . 
this may be the nature of the fm signal . 
it is about the size of a hand trowel . 
well ,  today was that day ,  phone died at work and my work charger broke also . 
i know you can buy a more durable item than this . 
i gave these earphones a good two months of break in time ,  and they just never got any better . 
i went to the eye doctor with my num_num year old . 
very innovative ,  fantastic idea and the cats really like playing with it . 
however ,  upon the very first sip ,  i couldn t believe how far from vanilla taste this coffee was . 
rotting in the sun . i put a throw rug down from walmart and she doesn t blink an eye . 
does the price make you suspicious ?  it did me . 
i realize that is not the intended purpose of this bag . 
after eating a few ,  is definite not worth the price of grocery store . 
the paper never stays in place and she often ends up drawing on the plastic . 
the extra num_extend really makes a difference . nothing sticks to the finish and it is a breeze to wash by hand !  !   . 
i really wanted this product to work because i hate gasoline powered lawn mowers . 
i love the size ,  form factor ,  and usability of this headset . 
i tried apple cider vinegar alone without this ,  cleared up a pimple i couldn t get rid of . 
i thought i was some kind of freak since it was not working for me . 
i ve been searching for a latch box for my daughter ,  but they re all over $ each . 
i must admit ,  this is my first exposure to the tomb raider franchise . 
as for these boots feeling like athletic shoes ,  i d have to say no . 
i waited till it was dry and vacuumed it up . 
i am selling my xbox after playing a few games and not even over num_num hours of gameplay . 
we have had fun testing them and it is something that i have always had an interest in . 
be careful !  i would have left one star but thankfully amazon let me return the cable without any hassle . 
i m not sure if it was user error or what ,  but we tried to follow instructions . 
i cannot recommend this game to anybody  unless i want to see that person throw a fit  . 
this is an expensive cat food that is mostly gravy with a little shredded chicken mixed in . 
it s probably much more realistic than other wwii shooters ,  but it gets annoying very fast . 
got this to use once a day to hopefully prevent those random little suckers and keep my face clean . 
or you could just wait for the next generation to arrive . 
there s a lot of flaws with this bluetooth that other ,  cheaper devices don t have . 
i mean really bad sticking to the point that the product requires almost full time attention . 
the company took it back and is sending me a refund . 
i can t believe someone hasn t invented a much better sifter for the baby boomer generation . 
i then found it to be completely useless and annoying to use . 
it s going to rot my teeth for sure and leave a sticky mouth feel . 
i have been a shortwave buff and radio collector for many years . 
somehow those were worse !  eventually i went to menards and got a pair for $ there . 
plus ,  the cord is too short for desktop use . 
it broke in half the first time the board was used . 
had to take the tent off before we even had it a week . 
this is mainly a problem early in the game where character roles aren t as developed . 
coffee model allows you to choose between num_extend num_extend and num_num quarts . 
go for a higher quality than hoya when selected a polarizer lense . 
anyhoo ,  i called apple ,  they said return it for maintenance . i did . 
not those plastic strips that don t work ,  and especially not the strips with the wax already on it . 
i ordered this bra to wear it at zumba and absorb some shock and flopping around . 
detailing is not very good for this price . 
i ordered this item as amazon is throwing item for free along num_extend ipod . 
this toy would be better for a smaller dog . 
the inclusion of lead in the product is entirely by choice of the manufacturer . 
i received the petmate freshflow in november ,  num_extend and put it to work right away . 
i ve very disappointed because it was an excellent charger during the brief time it worked . 
i couldn t just break one in half if i wanted to . 
i used a variation of the method mentioned in the review by num_extend  joe  . 
yet ,  ac output is much lower than this presumably due to inverter losses . 
not fit to send in my kids  school lunches ,  for sure . 
when i received my alcis relief pain relief cream in the mail ,  i was very excited . 
even streaming the video over the internet was very easy to do . 
i read somewhere ,  take their knees out first becuase their thorax is heavily armored ,  tried that ,  still got killed . 
other appliances that use electric motors such as sump pumps are likely to exhibit the same characteristics . 
it wouldn t have taken much to turn this into an enjoyable game . 
i then loaded it onto my nephew s xp dell with no trouble . 
i happened to ask where this set was made . 
good luck on who else decides to purchase this . 
bought this for my son when he was about num_extend
freezes constantly !  the cut scenes have not worked yet ,  and the game will stop in the middle of loading . 
you could get as much water pressure by just swishing your mouth out with warm water . 
we bought on amazon before christmas and paid too much . 
get the one that $ here ,  it works great . 
even the grinder has no control over the fineness of the grind . 
the case was plastic ,  not metal as described when i bought it . 
i might as well have plugged it into a simple surge protector . 
the board is made of cardboard so it is not sturdy . 
i am not pleased with it whatsoever . i have been using olays  complete all day moisture  lotion for years . 
they insisted that nothing was wrong with their food . 
to say there is no replay value is an understatement . i never tried the multiplayer . 
the tiny bits of fig are similar to the skins of popcorn kernels which get stuck in your teeth . 
i m glad it has worked for others ,  but it didn t do so well with me . 
these do not freeze completely and when used they don t maintain the beverage cold ,  maybe for an hour . 
i tried it several times with the same result . 
this toy is terrible . first there are sticker decals for the giraffe s spots .  .  . seriously decals ?  haven t used those since num_extend
this is a fine bra ,  but i found it pretty rather than supportive . 
i can t believe it has so many great reviews . 
you may as well buy a generic jar of  real mayo  and add your own choice of olive oil . 
the exterior coating around the oven door is flaking off and one of the carrying handles broke off . 
the only thing that worked flawless was the color changing lights . 
you will be embarrassed to go out for the next month or so . 
i have some similar sandals from columbia and some generic ones from payless and i ve never had that problem . 
i got them thinking they would be a great snack with cheese or meat or jelly . 
i thought this might help keep him from losing any more weight . 
plus ,  natural flavors leaves it open to whatever they want . 
they look good ,  and come in a good packaging . 
i m going to look for an extra thick tube minus the slime next time . 
this one does not ,  so that has to be a positive . 
it s quite stiff when the writing tip is retracted ,  but flops around a lot while you are writing . 
probably not a good way to find out what blood type . 
it seems like mgs is heavy on story time . 
my num_num year old son wanted this for christmas . 
would likely be fine for small cats and kittens . 
so in summary they are not suited for my dogs ,  something to consider . 
her carats were small before using it ,  and it spread after . 
save your money and just get the wind up cars only . 
i am glad the dog did not run away . 
i feel bad that i sent these to school for my daughter to eat for lunch . 
im deducting a few stars but it works well when wearing a cowboy boot . 
checked the connection between the laptop and the cable . 
anyone know where i can find a pump that works ?  . 
the game is just chaos ,  no structure ,  no commanding officers  unless doing missions ,  and not really even then  . 
also ,  it seems to work ok with the broiler . 
this tool does not work as far as i can see . 
maybe you have to drink to like this game and because i don t drink i just don t get it . 
but since i had never tried it before ,  i decided to splurge . 
however ,  this does prove they re well built because they still work after all those drops . 
have used hundreds of drives from all the vendors . 
auto modelista is a huge let down as far as racing sims go with only one saving grace . 
i guess i was hoping that an internal card wouldn t have those types of problems . 
 recommended  hardware is num_extend and a radeon num_extend
it is about num_num inches ,  about num_num inches too short for listening with a music player in your pocket . 
the third night ,  the nooski caught a mouse . 
although you re getting what you paid for ,  just heed my warning and don t waste your money on this product . 
unfortunately ,  that wonderful smell doesn t transfer to the actual cup of brewed coffee . 
too bad ,  because otherwise it s nice and slim and it looks great . 
the result is a very poor sound quality experience . 
he said i would need to contact the seller to try to get a refund . 
looks good on paper but has no effect on the movement of num_extend travel trailer . 
just don t count on the tip holding up ,  purchase a micro cloth and air blower . 
so i can t get absolutely every piece unless i reach my hand in there with a scoop . 
i have three cats who absolutely refuse to drink from anything but a fountain or the tub faucet . 
i might be in the minority but this games slow and hollow gameplay did not impress me . 
the whole thing is going in the trash . 
i thought it cheap for the price ,  and it is just that . 
it cleans easy and i usually just use it only when i need a significant amount of garlic . 
instead ,  it tastes more like prune with grains ,  and could not taste much chocolate nor coconut at all . 
that s not a huge deal ,  i know i m petite and i can hem them . 
the price is very high and not worth it if she ll only eat a couple of bites . 
not one of these caught a gosh darned thing . 
you get what you pay for though i guess . 
so ,  the deer can t be  repelled  until they are  attracted  . 
this case didn t last longer than about num_num months for me . 
i ve owned the rio num_num and i liked it . 
so now it just sits in my closet . 
big mistake !  !  !  !  as others have mentioned ,  the petals fell off every time we used it . 
a set of num_num x num_num for my bmw num_extend
they were aware of the time frames at all times . 
then ,  after several days i developed a body odor . 
it literally came dirty and the bag ripped . 
i also think that amazon should insist that their advertisers or product suppliers should be truthful in there ads . 
most people don t even know and rca is happy to hide the facts . 
any slight tug would deform the surrounding fabric ,  which is dissapointing . 
it was not clear whether or not it was so i am betting it is not . 
it would be easier to handle if it weren t . 
in this game ,  the short time span makes it impossible to do anything with the minor powers . 
it s a metal can with a soft plastic lid to seal it again once you ve cracked it open . 
these neither fit my smallest cabinet in my rv nor do they fit well within their telescoping tube . 
i can tolerate them but my kids wouldn t go near them . 
i m waiting for the next food drive to donate the other num_num cans . 
this model has a big coil in the middle that is submerged in the water . 
these do not function as sling attatchment hooks . 
they are very comfortable in feel and fit . 
it wasn t as though i was trying to use the wipers on packed ice or anything . 
it is messy ,  it will end up everywhere . 
it was pretty basic and didnt have a tight fit . 
it simply does not grind to different coarseness . 
i d try one order and see how you tolerate it . 
the belt has to be wrapped a few times around a num_num year old . 
just how about you don t look at it ? these taste fine . 
if you have oily eyelids you will need to use primer ,  otherwise it crease like eyeshadow . 
i usually have to try several times to get it started . 
again ,  as another reviewer said ,  usually i am able to assemble toys without the directions .  .  . not the case here . 
and i soon found out i had to use twice as much coffee bean to make the perfect pot . 
it has dirty bass ,  poor midrange  near not midrange  and flat and dull highs . 
the menus on the camera itself are very easy to use and num_extend
this is a big disappointment ,  but unlike the game s many glitches and bugs ,  this was to be expected . 
so i could not get in all in the toilet fast enough . 
but having no multiplayer makes the game become a low score . 
i returned this product twice hoping that i d get a replacement that would prove me wrong about this product . 
you were beautiful and classy on the outside but cheap and trashy on the inside . 
just do not like the flavor of this coffee at all .  .  . not authentic . 
great for dieters or anyone who enjoys a light snack that won t pack on the pounds . 
my husband has since stapled them to the ceiling . 
shipping would be more trouble than it s worth . 
i bought this item because right in the ad it said made in usa . 
i don t want to play that game ,  i want to play symphony of the night . 
then ever since it s been producing weird ,  confusion sensations . i been testing this for some time ad enough so far . 
already nestle purina has brought in their own management team . 
it s going back to dlink .  .  . forget about tech support or getting an return authorization . 
you decided to buy one yourself here at amazon . 
you will throw these in the trash just as i did . 
does not smell nearly as good as the original and the scent fades quickly . 
i got up to the taffy pull stage ,  after carefully reading and annotating the instructions . 
then i noticed that i could not monitor tape recording output from three head deck and dbx record monitoring . 
if you re over num_extend playing this game is laughable . 
that makes me suspicious of its advertised num_extend capacity rating . 
ok ,  so i bought these for some reason thinking they were metal . 
some people do not like the graphics used here . 
if you are talking to clients on the phone all day ,  this is important . 
if not ,  why they sent a opened box looks like some using it ? amazon . com needs to say something !  . 
they have obviously changed theirformula for making the glue . 
i bought them on subscribe and save and was planning on getting them every two months . 
with the case off ,  it just barely fits . 
beauty is my passion ,  so i try everything . 
does show fingerprints even though it says it doesn t . 
not sure why ,  used as directed ,  didn t make a bit of difference . 
i had read that this game was not up the usual high standards of the spyro series . 
and some even gave num_num and num_num stars to this pos product .  .  . unbelievable . 
i don t feel like it makes my hair stronger nor does it help with thinning hair . 
also ,  google  droid bionic problems  and get smart before you buy . 
if there was a zero ,  i would have used it to rate this item . 
i stopped for a week and her stool was back to normal . 
carhartt makes great stuff ,  but theres nothing special about these suspenders to pay $
you get what you pay for i guess . 
this brand is not for us so i won t be purchasing these again . 
the part that plugs into your car doesn t look like this either . 
i ordered a size num_num they sent me an num_extend
by day num_extend the squirrels had gotten past the baffle and were munching on the bird seed . 
i thought that maybe it takes more than one time to see better results . 
the races in that game are very different . 
you have to pull the batteries out and reinstall them for the damn thing to work again . 
in addition ,  i love the taste of cherry . 
thats how hard it is to get it off . 
and i think this is my first negative review on amazon !  the  clings  didn t cling at all . 
no matter what i did it just turned out more of a hassel then being useful . 
if you have eaten lots of garden vegetables like us then you will notice that right away . 
if you want to ruin your special clothing then use this product . 
these cups would be an excellent product if the method for attaching the handles was improved . 
we havea small eating area in our kitchen so it was perfect for space saving purposes . 
it was ok but easy to beat and not a chalenge . 
i installed the tubes and within num_num hours one tube had deflated . 
something such as a littermaid is way more self cleaning than this one . 
i literally used it for about num_num minutes and the batteries  which were brand new  died . 
overall ,  the best concoction i have found is airborne ,  and i still swear by it . 
the fact that you can purchase additional weapons ,  etc . 
sadly ,  this is where all the positives end . the flavor of this beverage is almost medicinal . 
he was not use to anything rubbing his skin in that area and the material is pretty stiff . 
i don t know what all the ranting and raving is over this product . 
my mother and my mother in law had kitchen aid stand mixers that lasted over num_num years . 
my wife s evo and my old iphone num_extend whatever their faults ,  worked . 
after twisting on it twice i stripped it out . 
the unit behaves as if i m adjusting the volume or pressing rw . 
had another one much better quality will try and figure out where i got that one . 
i m going to spend more money and get something i can have confidence in . 
this gets a  meh  rating from me and i would not repurchase or recommend . 
now i have to use the pitiful internal memory and always carry a notebook computer wherever i go . 
i remember playing sonic the hedgehog for the sega genesis and sega cd and having a blast . 
try maybelline concealer which at least covers; i am sticking to that one . 
i really thought this was a shield for the back of the phone . 
you d be better off plugging a pair of cheap dollar headphones into the back of your computer . 
i eat peanuts with beer at bars ,  not at breakfast . 
it almost felt like a clarifying shampoo that gives your hair a squeeky feel . 
not really a good taste for my pallet . 
this product is advertised as  pure vitamin e  with no ingredients list . 
i ve found num_num round bricks of num_extend ammo for $
but there were many things i dislike about it . 
you have to be able to stick something into the press holes or it just doesn t clean well . 
plus ,  my face broke out when i applied it . 
while somewhat entertaining and strategic falsebound kingdom can be infuriating and features basicly the same gameplay level after level . 
a small piece of plastic used as a retainer for the brushes broke . 
but if you are looking for a peanut butter alternative ,  this peanut spread is a surprising catastrophe . 
if you are interested in the game ,  give it a rent . 
power off and on and it is fine for a few minutes . 
stat building and leveling up is handled well . 
i was excited when these arrived because they were true to the color and photo as seen on line . 
it was dry and chalky and very tasteless . 
i agree with charlie   another amazon reviewer  who said the package was difficult to open . 
it tasted merely ok ,  which is a disappointment ,  because i like strawberries and i like applesauce . 
im a huge fan of nba live num_extend but num_num really sucks . 
i tried it on my desktop and on a mousepad .  .  . no difference . 
she had a jumperoo and it was used a lot until she exceeded the weight limit . 
i bought a different brand and i had better results on the pills i bought at the store . 
a label num_extend means nothing if they are not the real thing . 
it helped fill the hole for a little bit ,  but not something that will last a long time period . 
i was so excited for spore ,  but the end result was disappointingly shallow and vapid . 
so it comes out to under num_num bucks a pound . 
but then i hated how weak and rushed the plot became . 
we like sweet potatoes so we assumed would like these pop chips . 
it does not fit well ,  it constantly comes off your heel  like other reviewers stated  ,  and is generally uncomfortable . 
i tried a num_extend mag from my high end airsoft num_extend and the feed is on opposite sides . 
its either the stainless steel or the nonstick insides with the anodized outsides . 
bought this because it was the way to get the chamber brush . 
different color ,  different internal holding material ,  and no hook on the to attach to something . 
the buckles across the abdomen are rather large ,  and could be redesigned to be less intrusive . 
there is a big space between the drum and the hopper and big pieces of cheese fall through . 
after arriving broken ,  it was glued with various glues so it would work . 
now you pretty much have to blow the whole thing up . 
while this is a nice case ,  it has minimal protection comared to something like an otterbox . 
it is very thin and requires at least num_num coats . 
i m not really sure what is supposed to be fun about it . 
i just would not recommend buying this item !  im pretty mad i bought num_num at the same time too . 
i use them for a very old cat who occasionally can not make it to his litter box . 
would not recommend when decent speakers are reasonably priced and readily available . 
we just went back to doing it with a pan on the stove . 
not always the case . be a label reader and buyer beware !  . 
but that wasn t enough ,  so i added the obagi benzoyl peroxide therapeutic lotion to my regimen . 
and that did not help . i will try a few more days to see if i can figure out . 
i purchased this item a couple of years ago and ,  until today ,  used it two or three times . 
if you already use stevia and are used to it ,  then this is better . 
it was not long before the leg mechanism broke  internally  . 
i have three dogs and only one of them would eat these treats . 
if you buy any order it about num_extend two large so it fits correctly after five washings . 
you might want to wait for this one . 
the game board can also be expanded for longer games . 
i really wanted to like it ,  but it just did not work for me so i returned it . 
i like the generic store brand fabric better than these for a fabric bandage . 
the plastic disc with adhesive that is supposed to be an optional mount surface was useless . 
there was maybe a tiny bit of lemon flavor but really it was just the ginger flavor . 
after about nine months i now own an unrepairable ,  i . e . 
i had the earpiece properly inserted into my ear ,  sounds horrible . 
i ended up putting it in the shed and used the neighbors . 
the tightness is not adjustable though they can be lengthened to the point where they don t fit . 
i gave them a try but they would fit a child s hand unless one has tiny tiny hands . 
i ll go back to eating raw pumpkin seeds . 
i would recommend using the original gun sights if you need functional sighting . 
much more importantly ,  the digitizer on the zire num_num is not sufficiently refined or sensitive . 
each quarter i review what is in my basic overnight pack ,  which is a single strap over the shoulder . 
this grinder does not grind coarse enough for french press . 
next i took the arrow out of the dirt and just slid it underneath some taller grass . 
all of them will be trashed when i buy replacements . 
i can highly recommend the voyaber num_num and i cannot recommend this blueant model at all . 
i have some rural property and mice have been an issue . 
mucana really does increase dopamine and it will help you feel better . 
i ll put it in the  fail cosmetic  basket i have on the shelf in the bathroom . 
the material was thin and extremely starchy when it arrived . 
after playing splinter cell ,  no other games compare to it . 
the silver on these is not a woven celtic silver knot . 
we tried to fix the cd twice and it had no improvement . 
it leaves a weird film on my skin unless i turn around and scrub my face with something else . 
now she can t tell if i m going to do the dishes or walk out the door . 
 :  i have very curly hair that s on the dry side . 
go with monoprice ,  or try belkin ,  as belkin used double shielding ,  and monoprice makes some cables with triple shielding . 
i noticed no difference than when i didn t take them . 
i made sure i maintained it well ,  cleaning it regularly etc . 
he said after a couple months the elastic was no longer holding up . 
they come apart all the time and you have to keep putting them back together . 
this is an excellent idea ,  though it was poorly implemented and doesn t really make much of a difference . 
it was too small and i looked like laura ingles ftom little house on the prairie . 
the quality of the material was good but over all poor design on the clip in my opinion . 
my cat loves it ,  but the toy breaks too fast . 
my truck is a num_extend did cassette players change since then ?  i doubt it . 
but if you are looking for curls or waves ,  this is not the tool . 
this chew toy would be good for cats !  . 
it has a very minty smell  no noticable almond  . 
even if you don t cut yourself ,  it will not be comfortable holding one of them . 
bought one of these because i liked the cable . 
i received the regular  tenth doctor s sonic screwdriver .   my son was very disappointed . 
but if you take it with theanine ,  it adds a litlle sensation of relaxation to l theanine . 
i figured if i was going to invest in an expensive saddle ,  the maintenance kit would be worth it . 
rent it if you re curious ,  but you ll be disappointed . 
didnt last very long at all .  . the product that is . 
man do i wish i could get my money back . 
if you need to go through walls ,  watch out . 
i can t imagine how hot the num_extend btu can be . 
hopefully my sister in law can sew it back together . 
if your a stratagy lover and have patience of steel perhaps you will like this game . 
put in a bigger battery or accept a shorter time between charges . 
these will end up in the donation bin . 
consumer reports rates this as number one for making smoothies ,  and it is a great blender ,  sort of . 
i even tried wearing a head band under it and no go . 
i can see why it received such high rating for safety . 
it is very persnickety what the nook can play is rendered exceptionally well indeed . 
the nose pin is uncomfortable ,  but if this device worked ,  i could get use to it . 
they were nice glasses for the price and i probably would have worn them more if they didn t scratch . 
i preferred the cap  switch .   it makes electrical contact by twisting the cap tight . 
when i finally get the condom on it doesn t loosen any . 
it s like a hotel california for tea leaves . don t waste a nickel on this nightmare of a product . 
but ,  there is a physical  stop  in the housing which prevents the fan from pointing down ,  at all . 
it even claims you re not supposed to use any extension cords with it . 
it is never ready . omlette is the toughest thing to clean if it falls at the back . 
sorry ,  but it s not a knock on the food . 
it turns out that one of the bottles had a hairline crack in it . 
i wish i could give this away to some of the people who reviewed it and like it . 
netgear tech support just keep telling me to install the latest driver or install num_extend patch . 
not for the first time ,  i might say . 
at first i loved this ,  but it has almost completely fallen apart . 
same as the num_extend but now with bluetooth . 
i could see myself in the reflection which shouldn t happen with matte . 
i know this is not a review of the trind but for now ,  the trind is amazing . 
not even with the little socks that came with it . 
i didn t make the connection to these pills at first . 
i got the black patent and wanted to love them but just couldn t . 
what this means for your daughter is that not all of her barbie clothes will work on this doll . 
gave it away after indifference from my dog . 
i agree that the  pasta  isn t bad but it isn t the best gf i ve ever had ,  either . 
its not the best i ve ever owned but it does the job . 
the case also makes it hard to reach for the volume buttons . 
however ,  so that i didn t waste the box ,  i tried them in milk . 
i ll be giving this away to a friend with a younger child very shortly . 
i just need something to clean the boots i have . 
i am baffled by the number of good reviews this product has . 
i totally got my hopes up for nothing . 
i ordered the flavored variety pack and this flavor just tastes  muddy  to me . 
the top ,  the bottom ,  the strap and i believe part of the sides are all plastic . 
removing the  extra  bits of plastic apparently saved money on manufacturing as well as shipping . 
this is a long playing shooter with very poor graphics and average sound . 
i requested a refund and would not recommend it for purchase . 
 ?  ?  ? that s their opinion without knowing exactly what plastic is used who knows if it is safe . 
also ,  the front panel tells you nothing but the time of day . 
plus you can record a message for her to hear . 
so don t be affected by the star rating if you are looking to compare brands . 
i have regularly been buying this and the product is excellent . 
it gives your lips a feeling of being coated in wax rather than being moisturized . 
i would not buy these again ,  please try another product . 
if you must play it ,  go into it with no expectations . 
i find myself subconsciously looking for a light switch on the wall every time i enter a new room . 
it tastes similar to dissolved tums or chalk . 
same problem many of these style cases have ,  look for metal clips instead of plastic . 
that probably goes for other gm autos as well . 
i gave this to my dog after he had been sick with a gi illness . 
eventually i just ripped it off because it looked awful . 
i have tried everything to get the trapped water from underneath the inside rim ,  but to no avail . 
that is probably why so many barbers swear by the stuff . 
i pressed the pump and the lotion spurt out an oily water substance . 
should have gotten aqva marine heard its noticed more with a sweeter after tone . 
you may actually enjoy this drink more than i have . 
the water will start to look thick and cakey . 
i use windows num_num on a piii num_extend with num_num ram and num_num gig eide harddrive . 
nothing like like making the customer responsible for a problem . 
this is not the toy i remember from my youth . 
i did this because i had to install the tv asap and could not wait for a replacement . 
while i don t hate it ,  i wouldn t recommend it . 
pure cotton breathes in hot weather ,  and absorbs sweat better . 
but it does come in the mail quickly . 
one side was smaller than the other making it not fit properly . 
this harness bunches up and slides around ,  eliminating any chance at being comfortable for my pooch . 
phase num_num is a simple contract rummy variant . 
spend a little more and get gold or silver ,  you will not regret it !  . 
i have had a lot of different brands ranging from easily dissolved to chewable tablets to gummies to pills . 
there s no room for toys ,  no room to move around . 
it feels as if the game was rushed unessecerily to meet a deadline . 
it had a mildly coconutty  though not sweet  flavor ,  but it just wasn t anything special . 
we super glued it ,  but it keeps breaking . 
although i haven t tried bleach yet ,  the crayon is not coming completely off our tub num_extend
the metal case it came in was bent . 
all they do is stand around and do nothing . 
this ingredient means  sugar fungus  and its common name is brewer s yeast . 
that ,  my friends ,  is a load of bullhockey . 
bought these based on all the high ratings for my num_num year old granddaughter . 
i have seen higher quality sunglasses at the spinner rack on the counter of the local gas station . 
tried the product for over num_num months morning and night ,  it did not work . 
i only bought this because i got this free with my lens purchase . 
for me it was not so much as it being too sweet as it just not suiting me . 
it did protect my screen ,  but its not anti glare . 
but things immediately reveal themselves to be terrible . 
the gameplay is fun ,  when you re actually playing . 
pretty tight around the ankle so that when i tried walking in them it hurt . 
i was ordering these for myself ,  but they ended up going in my husband s sock drawer . 
the baby used it the afternoon it came and never looked at it again . 
it s like my oily glands went into overdrive . 
i bought a brown and black pair of this model . 
it bogs down easily and the blades feel reluctant to slice into anything . 
just ok compared to others belonging to friends . 
the power button worked but the proximity sensor did not . 
didn t know if it was my fault of just a faulty wire . 
i since added a tow hitch and hitch rack and am very happy with that setup . 
this stuff was very dry and difficult to chew up . 
and there is alot of potential to this title . 
i ve read similar reviews about the monster :  too much unwanted noise and rattling . 
our girl plays with this a lot and so far has not been able to destroy it !  . 
if it will be anywhere near you ,  purchase something else unless you like fan noise . 
sit in your car and listen to every single radio frequency . 
three times the money ,  but i would say three times the build quality . 
so i will soon be back to the perfectly clear gorilla glass which doesn t scratch anyway . 
initially liked the impressive towns graphics but quickly becomes cumbersome . story a bit weak . 
i have to replay some levels five or six times to get through . 
this thing is a huge piece of disappointing junk . 
he told me to stop taking the product at once . 
i m very disappointed but praise its sleek design . 
if they could fix this problem ,  it would be a great bra . 
the sound unit was making a horrible noise and it wouldn t stop . 
i will definitely not recommend this phone to anyone . 
it could be due to my condition .  .  . but i fouled other products .  .  . paul mitchell awapuhi treatments much better . 
the unit came and right out of the box it had a rattling noise inside . 
the outer cocoa layer was somewhat bitter ,  too . 
i seem to have received a  posessed  coffee pot as it finds different ways to torture me . 
i usually trust sony products ,  but the range on this is decieving . 
after several hours it was only mildly cold . 
i hate having to take down mountain giants ,  but they aren t too bad ,  same with those spirit walkers . 
the case did not fit the note num_num and once forced on the case+phone does not fit the holster . 
one guaranteed way to crash it is to turn on port forwarding ,  for something simple ,  like ftp . 
i never have tried the stuff again ,  but i will give it a second chance . 
maybe she is just too advanced for it . 
the play link is incredibly easy to use ,  but it doesn t have much bandwidth . 
if you like repeative ,  easy games than this is for you . 
the cats who need it won t eat it . 
the headset has recently become useless because the main body of the case has cracked . 
it smells great  a nice ,  clean smell  and it does make the skin more supple . 
it appears i am meant to be wired . 
the more i took ,  the worse i got . 
the result :  a slightly improved phaser ,  one that still churned out plenty of distortion . 
i do not recommend you get them even if they come in a pack of num_extend
the controls are awkward and it doesn t feel right . 
it has trans fat !  if i had known ,  i would not have purchased . 
use a regular toothbrush and get your teeth clean regularly is the best prevention . 
that is how i have been drinking this hazelnut flavored coffee the past week . 
i gave a can of the chicken a ride in a food processor to make a chicken salad . 
i didn t like the fit at all and sent these back . 
definitely not worth purchasing onling !  would be much better off spend an extra $ at the local sports authority . 
sight came broken , as i read others had the same problem . 
it took num_num hours ,  but i got it installed ,  without the bloat ware ,  and the sound quality is great . 
the point is you just cannot wear these shoes . 
plus ,  the upcoming version will be a much better value . 
honestly the cables that come with the system are fine . 
whatever differences there are were negligible  until i started reacting  . 
the bulky plastic parts seem to take up a lot of the space meant for the dog . 
the ankle elastic is quite tight ,  and the material feels coarse  like burlap !   on the bottoms of my feet . 
but my second legend has the exact same problem . 
to go to some underground place and kill the boss . 
she fits in this fine for travel and overnight sleep . 
it s just too thick and bulky to be a trimmer . 
they all showed it working flawlessly ,  every time . 
i saw them here and thought this is great . 
i like the idea of a snapped side ,  but think both sides snapping would be more functional . 
i ve mixed it with low fat milk and water ,  but still the added pounds . 
i ve never gotten it to connect at better than num_num mbps and the connection frequently drops to num_num mbps . 
these cut off the circulation to your fingers . 
it fits my num_extend macbook pro perfectly and does exactly what it s supposed to do . 
received and tried out for the first time by making a large batch of peanut butter cookies . 
i would not recommend these covers for your phone . 
i checked the beans left in the can that i had not heated and they were burned also . 
i purchased num_extend of these cases ,  one for my wife s phone and one for mine . 
plugged this into a talkabout num_extend and it just transmitted . 
the track falls apart if you even just look at it funny . 
your boots will have to be literally about two sizes too big for these to fit into them . 
if you mow your lawn down to the dirt and curse at gas powered tools and hate mowing . 
we used the natural sources % elderberry concentrate for several years ,  faithfully taking num_num tbsp . 
this has to be one of the prettiest umbrellas ever . 
which is what it is designed for !  !  ! stay away from this atrocity . 
then it takes some time to straighten it . 
i immediately canceled our subscription to consumer reports and told them why . 
please save your money and dont buy this game . 
if you decide to purchase this pool make sure you put something under it . 
i wish i knew which apps caused it . 
for now ,  i ll have to stick with the overpriced cans or with cups of espresso . 
the covering is design well and does what it s supposed to do . 
they cost quite a bit more than these but you get what you pay for . 
i mean ,  you ll always have a game that will play . 
if you want to make any other shape ,  you have to purchase more track  expensive  . 
other than those deficiencies ,  the mat is reasonably padded and the material is soft ,  not silky but soft enough . 
first of all i went to use the pink one and it instantly broke . 
as far as protection goes it gets a zero . 
whatever it was i will not be buying these . 
i used anker screen protectors before and they are awesome . 
the button on our old one broke off and fell inside . 
if came in a bundle with the mapsource software ,  a usb cable and a lanyard . 
i m in my num_extend and am not unaccustomed to dealing with flatware . 
i reduced my calories a little more and continued exercising . 
i have this but i wouldnt  say it does a great job of cleaning up . 
the knives are very difficult to insert and even more difficult to take out . 
sattle up the syrup boys ,  we are headed to the flopzone . 
i was really looking forward to receiving this product but was disappointed with its result . 
the handle feels like a piece of junk . 
i finally got it in the air and hovering ,  or nearly so ,  moving very slowly across the livingroom . 
unfortunately ,  the fit of my new bras are very awkward . 
i wanted a white shawl but ,  when it came it wasn t white . 
i received this sauce from the vine program . 
the battery i got with it hardly lasts a whole day of shooting ,  especially when shooting in raw mode . 
first let me say that the steam comes out quite quickly . 
i lost only two dollars before i realized i have to get something else . 
which is not available off the shelf in most stores . 
it requires a deep pot filled with oil or a fry daddy or similar product . 
nevertheless ,  for $ dollars it should hold up better . 
they run small too ,  but have great support . 
it literally follows u through doors and into new areas constantly !  he s hard to kill and always comes back . 
the controls are responsive but make no mistake ,  this game rewards button mashing like few others . 
wish i never got it for my mother . 
i bought some little pictures ,  that i hung with these . 
this is extremely thin and very hard to tear . 
it would not fit in two other chairs i tried it on either . 
i tried using it every other day and still same rash with welts . 
the crappiest rts game is better than this . 
in my opinion ,  a dark roast should be much more stronger and bolder in flavor . 
at least when it s from the store you can return it after num_num days . 
translated ,  this is a waste of energy and money . 
the sound quality didn t exist ,  obviously . the second one was better .  .  .  . for num_num days ,  then it started doing the same thing . 
there are no puzzles or unique obstacles that have to be dealt with . 
you can see that these types of cases are less than ideal . 
from the first bof down to this one ,  the quality has gradually declined . 
i d get crazy messages and images on the screen ,  but no access to function . 
the word  cheap  comes to my mind for this product . 
i bought some locally and although the odor is similar it is much milder and tolerable . 
if this guy won t eat it ,  i can t believe anyone would . 
terrible dont waste your money unless you want a plan white case  !  . 
i tried again and the same thing happened . 
the first one lasted a few years at most ,  but the belt drive system went out . 
the box says that it is concentrated and will basically stain anything it touches and that is no exaggeration . 
kinda disappointed in this product didn t make my puppy relieve himself as expected . 
sound is not up to my other cheap koss headphones . 
i have had good luck with verbatim in the past but these disks suck . 
my whole kitchen is filled with oxo products ,  so i thought that i would try this . 
in fact ,  my hair looked lighter afterward ,  both times i used it . 
but thats ok i said ,  its kinda old game perhaps . 
it doesn t really stretch and does not bend easily . 
instead ,  i was informed that this device would not ,  in fact ,  provide me with wireless internet as advertised . 
although i did blood test continuously ,  i did not see much difference . 
mine is stained a dark brown and it almost looks like it is painted . 
the most upvoted review says that there is a dial to change how much product comes out . 
too dark for light blondes ,  does not look natural . 
the moto num_extend also doesn t come with a case ,  i used the one i had from the num_extend
it doesn t smell bad ,  but it also doesn t smell good . 
i would come home from a day at work and would play with a friend online . 
luckily ,  i caught it before it could cause any damage . 
villaware num_extend grand wrap tortilla and flatbread makeris cheaply made . 
it is all metal ,  and remember ,  caesar salad is not from italy ,  it s from mexico . 
when i requested this ,  a key bit of information was not listed on the amazon product page . 
sorry i couldn t give it a one star review . 
the gaps on the sides of the front are too large . 
i was skeptical because there are too many parts and openings . 
i ve never had this problem with my other protectors . 
it hasn t come off yet during play ,  but it s really only a matter of time . 
also ,  very strangely ,  the subtitles are usually off from what is being said . 
we don t prefer to portion and freeze our pet food ahead of time . 
num_num months ago i had a heel spur removed because it was so bad . 
chewing and inducing stomach juices constantly can give some people stomach problems as it did for us . 
i think there is something wrong with this food . 
i should have bought a rod and brush . 
anyways ,  life went on and i forgot to follow up . 
i bought the bear for my wife as just a little pick me up . 
i received this pan an hour ago ,  and it s going right back . 
otterbox accounted for this by cutting into the polycarbonate part a bit ,  but you can still feel something . 
he got the short end of the stick here . 
we have had two pairs of these now . 
makes constant hissing sound in the ear ,  and often it is quite painful . 
they all have their individual downfalls . however ,  this panasonic model is clearly the most disappointing . 
mine works really well and i even forget that i have it on me . 
to me ,  it was very dry ,  and the mocha flavor tasted like overly burned chocolate . 
i thought this would work well for me . 
i ate one for breakfast and found it moderately filling . 
but ,  i will probably go back to the crest product when i need my next round of whitening . 
i thought it would be a good product for my granddaughters fine ,  frizzy ,  curly hair ,  but it s not . 
it is cheap !  !  !  !  wobbles and my cat can t jump down . 
i have a kitty rescue ranch and hoped this would be of use . 
so you ll have to take a full serving in two bottles . 
the warm setting is actually the same as the high setting . 
so ,  it was with hesitation that i tried the vanilla ground coffee . 
he has kidney problems because he is diabetic . 
it really does have a great salon quality scent ,  compared to an artificial herbal essence or something . 
i guess you have to pick your discomfort in cycling . 
i will never be buying this product again . 
while this is pictured to be the usual humectress i ve purchased for years ,  it is not what i received . 
yes ,  it s funky and glitzy ,  but aside from its touted suction power ,  it s a terribly designed ,  expensive product . 
plus it had a huge chunk taken out of one of the openings . 
it just went to carpet which was no good for my hardwood floors . 
this just isn t the right exfoiliant for my face . 
tools ,  time and a workbench are required . avoid at all costs . 
this may be the worst game i have ever played . 
my wife and i really tried to like this but it was very tedious and slow . 
the color is great and it last ,  but it cakes on my eyes . 
the menu interface is probably more confusing than it needs to be ,  but you kinda get used to it . 
i don t care for this product much due to the white residue it left in my hair . 
i recently tried a brand called xylosweet ,  and it tastes much more like sugar . 
the stylus ruined the cover ,  i took it off after a few days . 
called apple support ,  after discussins with two tech support folks ,  answer was  windows problem  . 
there is more to this product and you need to investigate it before buying . 
we ll see what happens and i ll post an update . 
the shape of it is always weird and awkward too . 
the cap hole is very small and hard to get bb s out . 
we cannot proceed with your order without some action on your part . 
although not perfect ,  it seems a lot people have had satisfactory service with the num_extend firmware . 
it would cause my computer to sound an alarm for the s . m . a . r . t . 
not sure how that got num_num stars for obvious design flaws . 
i wish i had returned this and bought one from walmart . 
i can t seem to get it work with some other application  like work processor ,  spreadsheet  . 
as well as posting reviews ,  please report this product to the cpsc . 
it works ,  but the straps are constantly coming loose . 
but you know it could just be the one i got is a dud . 
i bought these for my dog and shelter dogs where i volunteer . 
others have said it more often and well . 
the color palletes for things are not right and there s a lot of dithering . 
also search the web for creative nomad firmware problem for more information . 
now for the good stuff num_num different missions set over num_num distinct period of time . 
they fit little kid fingers terribly ,  just look at the picture . 
there product is little better than insoles that come with your shoes . 
after cutting off the num_extend mm stereo plug from one and replacing it ,  it now works well . 
these are large capsules and you have to take two of them to get the promised num_num mg curcmin . 
however this shea butter is really different than products i ve used before . 
it does not have the traditional cinnamon flavor that i love . 
one reviewer says you should try this before buying six pounds of it . 
if you are looking for something to hold a few very small caplets ,  then this may work for you . 
it s cheap plastic with no strength in holding your phone . 
it leaves a strong acrid ,  bitter ,  pungent aftertaste that lasts for hours . 
 save your $ good backscratcher comes bagged or boxed because it touches your skin . 
trains can enter ,  but then can t make the turn to get out . 
worse ,  after you kill the frozen game ,  it won t recognize your dvd any more . 
but if you see an anchor hocking num_num qt for sale ,  let me know . 
it didn t really do much except for killing some mossy growth in the corner of one of the chairs . 
half of the tools you get with this kit are useless . 
especailly from a high end name as ugg s . 
personally ,  i don t care for the whole medieval politics setup ,  but it might please some . 
nope ,  num_num months later and it won t charge . 
my house is stinky enough as it is without the contributions of my dogs .  ncjvr  . 
organic bold and donut shop are still our faves . 
kojima did an excellent job on the incredibly character driven story . 
nothing to be done about it now ,  i suppose . 
this game however ,  takes an endless amount of time to complete a fight no matter what your level . 
 juice from the cashew fruit .   but i didn t care for the taste and it leaves your mouth feeling  filmy  . 
it also gave me a stomach ache and didn t make me feel very well . 
very time consuming and tiring to inflate  small valves you have to squeeze while num_extend
there are only num_num grams of fiber  not bad ,  but not great  and only num_num gram of fat . 
great range for candy making  unlike one of the more inexpensive models that amazon sells  and reasonable wire length . 
at least it was cheep i m sure one of my friends will take it off my hands . 
unfortunately ,  the cables suffer from interference while using some software combinations . 
i tried the dryer balls hoping to cut my drying time . 
also the material inside is not as soft as it used to be . 
my num_num year old dog is pretty set in what she likes and does not like . 
these are like construction worker or army boots . 
he started having gas and diarrhea from day one . 
i decided to try these inserts as they are relatively inexpensive . 
are there any one that agrees with me ?  ?  . 
overall ,  though ,  most levels are designed for enemies to take advantage of knocking you in a pit . 
also i don t think feeder is particularly photogenic . 
don t know what they did to the formula ,  but this one was yucko . 
but then i tried to feed this to my daughter . 
tried putting seasonings on it but it doesn t help . 
if you have it adjusted incorrectly at all it will not pick up anything . 
i don t like biting into ginger chunks ,  and had trouble mincing the ginger small enough by hand . 
i believe its possible this is just too harsh on my scalp . 
if you are look for a pump to run continuously then stay away from this one . 
however ,  i am very unhappy with the quality and fit of these protectors . 
i have read good things about this brand and finally took the plunge to buy it . 
there must be some ingredient in it that stimulates the cat s brain . 
i am so disappointed on the highball glasses ,  though . 
my hair feels great after using the therappe shampoo ,  then i use the conditioner and it actually feels worse . 
perfect up until the moment i discovered i had a penis . 
the foundation post can also be saved from this to use as a single scratching post . 
i would recommend just about anything made by belkin . 
dawn of mana is no exception as it is without a doubt one of the worst mana games ever . 
and doesn t fit at all down there ,  it s a mess . 
after i purchased it ,  i found it elsewhere for half the price . 
had a hard time seeing the pictures clearly even with glasses . 
so ,  now i m searching for another product ,  without any help . 
i love the design of this ,  especially with the little hole on either side to play in . 
i will then try your product again . hope this is helpful . 
after much fussing and swearing ,  my dog tolerated me putting this on him . 
reset button and repeated attempts to connect failed . not recommended . 
the problem is with the very thin wires . 
i am not able to drug around to water my flower beds . 
i do not recommend this product .  .  . my next one will be a simple brand . 
most of the oil had was tossed out along with the broken bottle . 
i d just go to a dermatologist if you have skin problems . 
we decided to try the frontline plus ,  and have been tremendously disappointed . 
the smell is a little sickening to me but if it did it s job ,  i could overlook that part . 
if you thought that farberware made good quality cookware ,  you are wrong . 
it s a good thing i didn t pay a lot of money for this case i will never use it . 
worst sleep i have gotten in my entire life !  i m going back to sleepytime tea . 
a certain mission early in the second part has max unarmed with the exception of a baseball bat . 
if you try to add resistance the pedals stick . 
i wanted to like it as i have heard so many good things about it . 
will definitely be buying a more sturdy one soon . 
very fancy bottle ,  when you pump it out comes that thick ,  greasy ,  white sunscreen everyone has run into before . 
even when i placed the itrip within one meter of my car s antenna ,  the sound quality did not improve . 
the cat and the dog can fit through it . 
 local  play makes me wonder what nintendo thought about how many ds systems each family was going to have . 
i used to buy depend when the item was white . 
i do love the regular donut house flavor ,  as well as the chocolate glazed donut  yum !   . 
the cardboard tag in the bottom was also identical . 
at that point i saw the metal on the inside of the pot start to corrode . 
i will be using this on my body when the summertime comes . 
arrived for christmas and discovered that without other sets this set could not make a circle . 
so ,  this sits in the drawer and we use it maybe five or six times . 
while the product has a lot of salt ,  i stilll found it rather tasteless . 
it is a shame that motorola build such a great phone ,  but no driver for it . 
aubrey organics has more natural ingredients and makes my hair cleaner and silkier . 
i had sensitivity set on high and changed range from num_extend to num_extend still no difference . 
it is lighter than a usual pomade but it is much stickier . 
i really wanted to like these ,  and i really wanted my kids to like them . 
for now all i can say ,  red bob s sunflower seeds seem  taste  pretty good to me . 
the only thing i can figure is that the workers selecting these orders suffer a deficiency of sighted awareness . 
this shoe was too snug for my taste . 
looks like the supplier found a way to cut corners on belkin recently . 
i too wanted my cats to have silica dust free litter ,  so i switched to this brand . 
he has already worn out his first pair so i decided to purchase these . 
i will certainly think twice before buying another one of their games . 
this router is serviceable and has good range but the firmware corrupts the memory . 
i m just glad it didn t turn my hair blue !  . 
here is the immediately reply i got in big bold letters . 
let me first say each channel is about num_extend max per channel at num_num ohms . 
i don t like the blade ,  the handle ,  the  saw  or the sheath . 
so he trimmed the hair and gave me a restorative shampoo to help my hair . 
i didnt think my head was too big until wearing these ,  now im self conscious everywhere i go . 
i was hoping to get a bargain when i bought this for num_num dollars . 
so ,  i borrowed the game from my work and i decided to play it . 
the light around this mirror does nothing but look pretty . 
and after you destroy those robots in point a ,  it makes you go to point b , and over again . 
if you have this helmet ,  give it a good tug on the straps and watch the harness fall apart . 
this game looked like fun but after trying it ,  i quickly lost interest . 
ok for a time ,  but there needs to be an end . 
i am used to strong coffee but this is was just a travesty . 
back in the num_extend before the epa stomped on the ingredients these worked great . 
if you really want this game get it for pc . 
i used it several times hoping i just needed to get use to it . 
these are comfortable but the sound is awful . 
rubber is a bit hard and does not glide smoothly with the screen of my ipad and iphone . 
however it doesn t charge to a full % and looses its charge quickly . 
num_num month old pup tore this up the very day she got it . 
they literally disembowel them and i find paper guts everywhere . 
and word compleation is a real timesaver over the palm . 
since the urine flows through the screen to get to the urine pad ,  it collects on the pastic . 
there s a lot of filler in this dog food . 
i thought the first one on playstation num_num was awesome along with san andreas . 
i was dissapointed in calms ,  it did have good reviews and i was so hopeful . 
price isn t that bad ,  but it just doesn t seem that healthy for your pups . 
the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough . 
i m hoping it s just a bad porting job done for xbox . 
after about num_num days it started to give errors when trying to preview my images . 
not quite what i was hoping for in a spawn game . 
it worked well and left my skin feeling clean and dead skin free . 
in other words ,  i could not insert the num_extend battery . 
i understand its satin and all but doesn t mean you get to rip people off . 
this was a christmas gift and it has already ripped and is heading to the dumpster . 
yeah it kinda worked for a day or so . 
all i need is the top part . so this is a good item i suppose . 
although i did not buy the guide ,  it may help some players outofficial nintendo super paper mario player s guide . 
just like other reviewers said ,  they are not dried ,  they are like preserved with too much sugar . 
for num_num dollars you d expect it to be aluminum at least . 
i think american crew is a pretty good line of inexpensive products for hair . 
the light was not bright enough to trace things .  .  . all in all this product was very disappointing . 
not much to do with this little workbench . 
no no no no no no no no no . 
best bet would have been to send back to amazon but was num_num days out of full refund window . 
it is extremely light with a very comfortable band . 
i hope this is corrected in the future . 
so far num_extend weeks  it s absolutely silent and puts out as many bubbles as the fusion did . 
moreover ,  i don t like any product that automatically installs a required program . 
i noticed my flat beater had a chip in it ,  so i ordered num_num of the burnished . 
summons once again find little reason to exist  seems to be an issue since num_extend
most games you type in your cdkey ,  hit install ,  wait a num_num minutes ,  and you are done . 
will keep using unless i find something better . 
not !  like i said ,  i am a casual user . 
as far as the style is concerned it s ok but the material for the screen protector is horrible . 
the windows that pop up have no explanation . 
you d burn more calories raising your chair up a little and swinging your feet back and forth . 
it did not fall from a high place either . 
my husband ended up having some made for me that never all out because the backing is so tight . 
there is no distintion between waypoints and stops so it doesn t show stops along routes . 
also enjoyed playing with the colorul little balls . 
one star ,  because i didn t order espresso ,  but that s what i got . 
i found that this one didn t seem to last as long as the others once it got wet . 
you can put a hepa air filter near it like i did . 
i m not thrilled with these polishes as you can see . 
it seems amateur in many ways ,  and isn t particularly fun ,  either . 
the fact that this defect occurred while the razor was in use shaving my neck is rather alarming . 
i am reducing this another star because i hate the way that it dispenses . 
at a nickel a shave ,  it would take num_num shaves before i would spend $
ha is great for lines and lifting and vitamin c is great for skin texture and tone . 
the others do not hug my legs like sausage casings after one wash . 
maybe i don t know how to use it properly ,  but my cats don t pay it much attention . 
wrong !  not the right size and fit smaller than expected . 
he said it did absolutely nothing for his skin condition . 
the trays are very easy to wash right outside with the hose or in the kitchen sink . 
this happened while using the blue case ,  but they re the same exact product . 
i bought one of these little crepe pans . 
package and have realized that this product is probably worth about % of its msrp . 
this is not the case and i will not be purchasing from these deceptive people again . 
every negative review about this game is % correct . 
just not my type of shoe so sent back . 
be warned this microusb cable cannot be used to sync num_extend smart phones to pc . 
this is already an unpleasant task without adding to the aggravation . 
tried cell phone ,  num_num different phones in the house ,  and a pay phone . 
basically like eating a piece of crunchy cardboard . 
exept that he s paper .  .  . i don t recommend this game . 
contains chemicals that may cause birth defects or damage reproductive organs .   don t waste your money on this mess kit . 
it has a bad initial taste ,  and the aftertaste is even worse . 
read the other reviews to get a good idea of what you will be dealing with . 
i don t know exactly what is going on but i can tell you i don t like it . 
rather than making battles more varied and more interesting ,  it made them all play the same . 
this hanes bra is what it is ,  cheap !  !  . 
we purchase all of our mobile phone cases from amazon . 
now to get a num_num inch shield for num_num inch . 
the leapster and the explorer use diferent type cartridges . 
first ,  i should note that i kept the num_num lb . 
it had severe memory and birdnested sooninto its first trip . 
i really thought these blades would be awesome replacements for my oem s ,  i was wrong . 
i checked the product closely and noticed the ingredients label listed flax seed . 
thus ,  the ctb design allows the player to select an action without time pressure . 
i started on the standard dose program ,  nothing . 
i m not above silliness but this was downright boring . 
this is literally a non foaming gel cleanser . 
in order to crush dried bread into crumbs i have to run it for a long time . 
buy a zalman !  !  ! i purchased this chill mat ,  and it worked for a short period of time . 
the texture is fine but this has a very odd background flavor to it . 
the crust is pasty ,  the filling tastes totally artificial ,  and they are grossly sweet . 
it deleted my saved data all on its own . 
i managed to shoot a couple pods across the room while trying to free them . 
the wrestler creation capabilities were and still are the very best offering from any wrestling game . 
some may like this game ,  but i sure didn t . 
i changed my rating from num_num to num_num this puppy is just poor quality . 
the thing is most likley num_num years old . 
i had preferred a larger one given the purposes i have for it . 
the raindrops fall over your visor ,  when it s really hot your visor changes ,  or when it s cold . 
i am disappointed in this bra; i thought it would stand up to similar ones i had bought . 
if i ever remember to ,  i will try to update this comment . 
now it is out of warranty and the battery still doesn t work . 
i just got a new pair of short shorts for running and my thighs chafe a little . 
for example ,  one minigame involves dancing to impress the governor s daughter . 
moreover ,  $ dollars a month !  get outta here . 
this product didn t really work from the get go . 
they need plates that are removable ,  otherwise don t even consider buying it . 
its inside circumference at the elbow is only num_num inches . 
i bought this for my daughter who really likes to draw . 
this base coat is just terrible for my nails . 
if all you want is extra caffeine ,  you d be better off just taking a caffeine pill . 
although it stated this was for the phone i needed this battery did not fit at all . 
here is what i learned :  the discs work well in either one of the two dvd players we own . 
this product is a waste of money ,  work at all . 
good for the price but may not be the best choice depending on were your freezer is . 
i thought it was a rare defect so i returned it for a replacement . 
got it from amazon and that might be key . 
and the upper left button no longer works . 
it just seems too heavy and they cannot cannot get it to make any noises by themselves . 
for example ,  the arcade version was a stretched out screen with the score at the top . 
but after only a few weeks ,  it will no longer seal . 
i went ahead and boiled water and poured it in the cup . 
i do not recommend ,  there s been more than a few family pets lost due to eating poisoned mice ,  unfortunately . 
i really like nongshim s fresh udon bowls so i figured i d give this a try . 
from the other reviews it seems that this doll is defective . 
and the material was not soft at all . 
i mostly now days play games and stuff on my dell num_num which as been upgraded some . 
i took it in the morning before breakfast and it made my stomach a bit queasy but tolerable . 
the tag said num_num husky ,  but there was no way that they could be . 
also ,  with measurements ,  you can t be accurate if you re not quick due to the dripping problem . 
the graphics were not great but acceptable for a rpg . 
i haven t a clue how a company could release a product this horrible . 
don t buy it unless your life quality is worth no more than a few bucks . 
my biggest complaint ,  however ,  is that the lenses keep falling out . 
i bought the cybershot mainly for its size . 
she found it to be very uncomfortable ,  and pinched her in a number of places . 
doesn t work at all and takes forever to charge up  . only a paper weight to me . 
but for what it costs ,  i can t really recommend it as a a good value . 
too bad it didn t stay that way for long . 
i dont want to knock red storm down completely ,  but i play operation flashpoint . 
tech support could not even tell me what one of the two products was at fault . 
for the price and for what it does ,  it should hold up forever and have zero problems . 
it is perhaps not the best design for a larger breasted woman . 
not sure if this was a computer problem or what . 
they need to be a more responsible company . philosophy :  ok ,  but very pricey . 
the phone case is cute but provides virtually no protection . 
it is greasy and after using it once ,  i threw it away . 
i don t want to go through the trouble of returning it ,  so it goes in the trash . 
this case was classified as red and when i got it ,  it was a ugly pink ,  salmon looking color . 
if you do konad stamping i would just buy regular black nail polish at the drugstore . 
my review is on the smell of the perfume . 
this results in an increased production of free radicals under illumination . 
despite numerous vet visits  and tests  most of his inappropriate peeing is behavioral . 
they don t mention this in the ingredient list . 
the picture does not make justice to the product . 
did not care for the difficulty to operate this mount ,  more of a hassle then it is worth . 
if you like soft and do not mind looking like a slob ,  this is for you . 
the port of the mario num_num game is ok if you have never owned a num_extend
i m going to give the rest of the cartons to my mom; i hope she likes it !  ewww !  . 
used both brands on woodchucks ,  rabbits ,  and squirrels . 
this gets too hot and does not even curl . 
its a shame because it was cute at first . 
after blending for about num_num seconds ,  the motor blew . 
fortunately ,  i ordered from amazon  and not a third party  ,  so returning an item is easy . 
i bought these speakers because yamaha has a great reputation in making great musical and sound products . 
like the feel of the material and it fits just right . 
however ,  i cannot give a num_num star rating for a product that never worked . 
he chews cow hoofs ,  elk antlers ,  greenies ,  etc . 
on a positive note ,  i do like the thick consistency and the pump dispenser . 
could have gotten the same tool for half the price from other sellers . 
had they been smaller they would have survived . 
a very big waste of time and money on my part . 
these rca wireless connectors are okay for basic phone conversation over short distances . 
this was a constant fight to keep in position . 
somehow ,  despite hundreds of tournament fighters that will eventually hit stores ,  i doubt this will ever happen . 
the most one of them did was drape himself across it and use it as pillow . 
i had two in originally ,  one on each floor for about num_num days . 
the only defect i noticed was the cover blocks the voice recorder push botton on the side . 
to top it off ,  the left shoe is noticably narrower than the right . 
had to refresh the liter more often ,  and it tracked quite a bit . 
i really like that the turner is the shape and size i wanted . 
this doesn t fit my samsung galaxy ii phone num_extend
it is well made ,  but at least two sizes small for what the description says . 
the grabbing end of the points is so small ,  the hairs slip away from them . 
had an arc jump from this unit while i was attempting to plug a component in . 
i bought this monitor being mislead by high rating . 
this lens back focused anything but num_extend every after micro adjusting it . 
way to much upgrading you have to do for each class for every character . 
i bought these to replace a different set of pattern blocks . 
the software would not recognize the unit when hooked up though to usb . 
i would avoid it at all cost if you have very curly long hair . 
i can t attest to this tool s quality or utility . 
too flexible and can really hurt your feet when walking long distances . 
i wish i could return them but too late for that . 
hard to clean and it is already falling apart after few tries . 
first of all ,  this is a very heavy sprinkler and is awkward to pick up and move . 
still i didn t feed it to them again and never will . 
i boughtthis one thinking it was the same one as before ,  but it s not . 
this is a very poorly designed coffeemaker which i did not expect from cuisinart . 
it really enhances the sound of the model two especially when connected to my ipod . 
one singularly annoying example is that it crashes every time you kill a particular monster . 
i finished ,  but with a lot of cheating and form so poor ,  i wonder why i even bothered trying . 
to me it had less flavor in general and wasn t as cheesy tasting as the regular version . 
just not a great game ,  even accounting for the fact that it s intended for the youngest players . 
this one came broken and didn t make the noise when it struck something . 
i have a similiar one  not this brand that i ve had for over num_num yrs . 
a player can wind up punching in the wrong direction or attack his own tag partner . 
it does give it a  quick dry  layer . 
it s just awful in this area so this dual role is pretty much useless . 
the game doesn t take itself very seriously ,  which makes things even worse . 
that was years ago ,  but my fascination for tropicals has never really left me . 
i will spend a few more bucks on the next one . 
as i get older ,  lotions with spf sometimes don t absorb the way i hope they will . 
running on num_extend pentium on nvidia num_extend expansion pack runs slower than the main num_extend game for some reason . 
these are big and can a lot of stuff eg . 
i probably would have liked these better had i not followed the directions on the package . 
i compare my self in front of the mirror with or without and there was no change . 
i took the plunge since i know that the quality is well worth the money . 
noted the thread are slightly different in their pitches . 
i wanted something that could keep it s support . 
why must so many childrens  games be so loud and annoying ?  great game sans the quacking of the ducks . 
apparently there are several different sets of mario figurines . 
the cables kept getting caught on the seatbelt and my coat . 
also ,  the cord separated from the seat with normal use . 
if you are trying to lose weight or gain muscle mass ,  this product is not going to help . 
the fabric is not worth sewing back up . 
after a months ,  i just threw it out . 
i have arthritis in both hands and this was supposed to be easy gripping . 
at first i loved this product !  it covered quiet well and was very moisturizing . 
so i had to run out to my hardware a few blocks away and buy a coffee grinder there . 
that s a little drastic but that s the truth . 
i wish i could even tie these around the duck so she has to work to get them . 
bizarre . the only thing that keeps me from rating this as a one star product is the the $ price . 
it turned out to be one of the dumest games i ever played but chould not stop . 
the tint is pointless with this product because it blends into nothing . 
hope it works for you guys out there . 
now here is what i found with all these case logic albums . 
there should have been a way to turn this off in the options . 
also if i take it regularly i do get diarrhea . not really sure if i should recommend it or not . 
i almost skipped this product due to the low price and what i assumed would be poor sound quality . 
she was extremely upset the ice cream would nt stay on the cone . 
this is the worst squad game i ve ever played . 
i removed the barrel and used the supplied spanner wrench to remove the threaded cap that secures the barrel . 
they could not care less about their customers . 
my daughter is num_num months old and takes this toy apart every time she plays with it . 
this product was too good to be wasted . 
can t say i blame her for not advertising her name well on this one . 
these tools are made of high quality materials ,  and they look very nice . 
i again tried to set the clear plastic tube into the tray while holding the trigger with my thumb . 
you ll need it to clearcut your axillary forest . 
and by sealed ,  i mean likely gorilla glued . 
bad quality and didn t last very longbad quality and didn t last very longbad quality and didn t last very long . 
the silver tab on the stem that seats into the carrier however is a piece of junk . 
there are better products out there for the same price . 
do not waste your money on this poorly made tent . 
my first of these died in one year after modest use . 
i would have chosen to give this watch zero stars ,  but that wasn t an option . 
make sure you know its not large ,  only num_extend the size of your laptop screen . 
the way that it seals yet lets are in when drinking is not a good design . 
purchased this model for a friend and it was nothing but trouble and was returned . 
this is a heavy duty quality device except for one thing . 
in mission mode you do different missions ,  but once again they are very repetitive . 
if you are looking for abuzz or the caff affect ,  this isn t the one to do that . 
the tea tastes great but it didn t increase my breast milk . 
vendors on amazon often try to rip us off . 
it has a robust coffee taste but you need to imagine the kahlua . 
no matter how careful ,  tiny bubbles are visable when it  eventually  dries . 
it s worth spending more to get something that actually works . 
i was so surprised receiving my panda silicone jelly skin case cover within a few days of ordering . 
gamespot said it all :   infernal embraces style over substance ,  resulting in a dull and repetitive shooting experience .   . 
i d rather be overweight and enjoy my food . 
the impact cracked the lcd screen of the camera and ruined it . 
there were only a few whole pieces in the bag and a couple of crumbs . 
okay i purchase this product on feb num_extend num_num and it came in the mail feb num_extend
after doing some extensive research this is a common problem . 
don t buy ,  not worth your time and money . 
wish i could give them no stars on this one . 
in between those two ,  i purchased the black and decker . 
my three year old son got this toy for christmas and has hardly touched it . 
they were previously on sale at cosco @ num_num for $
this protector was not user friendly ,  does not cover phone screen , also doesn t stick like it should . 
even if you did enjoy another variety of the same product . 
don t be fooled though ,  it stinks on ice . 
i tried this out ,  twice as per the instructions . 
i had just bought a new coffee and i was thinking it must be stronger of something . 
i liked the fabric because i thought it would not cling to whatever i wore over it . 
despite the smell ,  i still gave it a fair chance . 
i was mailed the wrong battery and i need to send it back . 
wost game i have ever played for xbox by far . 
a more nutritious food will mean they eat less and poop less . 
unfortunatley he was affraid of the wiggle worm and didn t want anything to do with it . 
making an adventure out of a racing game ,  and the format they gave it is an excellent idea . 
the lid doesn t seal well and i used the pan to bake some cheescakes . 
waste of my money ,  but only in regards to my cat . 
like i said i do not like rpgs and especially this one . 
i had to use a screw on every single one . 
none of my family can open or close the zipper easily or sometimes at all . 
disappointed and duck is now buried somewhere in the yard .  .  . not work the effort to go dig it up . 
this was expensive and did absolutely nothing for my eyelashes . 
this product is highly recommended for lowering high cholesterol ,  and may prevent clogged arteries to a degree . 
i ordered the biggest size and i m not sure even a stick figure could fit into it . 
i ve used that for num_num years or so and it does work . 
i have curly hair and this is just awful for it . 
if it was quick and easy to navigate then the first song thing wouldn t be so bad . 
i followed the instruction but noticed no improvement in my feet . 
crystal clear picture ,  the fine audio through my stereo system fills the living room . 
found out that it is num_num years old . 
well the graphics are good ,  but that is not everyting . 
i would never recommend this product ,  and i can t see how anyone is . 
i had really high hopes for this game . 
this case was described as fitting the num_extend and it does .  .  . mostly . 
if you own the num_extend num_num coolpix digital camera ,  you will be thrilled with this custom case . 
i bought this to listen to football play by play while watching ucla games in the rose bowl . 
this product did not work for my dog . 
but when i wore them to work today i kept feeling like the right side was off . 
this years article states duracell procell as the best alkaline battery on the market . 
i can t see how this game gets such a high rating .  .  . i think it is for kids honestly . 
i would ve liked a little more fizz to it ,  i consider it just lightly carbonated . 
the nail polish is super thin and drips everywhere because of it . 
without one it s a touched up num_extend jaggies and all . 
it s very heavy too and hard to move around on the carpet . 
it must have left the shop in this condition . 
the nikon is on its way to ebay . i would strongly advise not to buy this camera . 
while it tastes good ,  it did nothing for my cold . 
i ve tried a variety of sugar free products and had high hopes for this jello brand cheesecake pudding . 
this product is useless and takes way too long to charge my phone . 
single punch ,  kick ,  throw ,  and tag buttons are dished up on a skyrocketing discomfort level . 
we will try to make up our own rules and see what we can do but otherwise quite disappointing !  . 
the main thing is for you to do your research and buy what you think is best for you . 
all chinese made dog treats  or people treats ,  for that matter  are dangerous and often deadly . 
however there might be people who like realism more than fun and if so this is your game . 
he didn t pull very hard but it was enough to make him not want to go forward . 
but i don t have this problem with other cables . 
this was given to us as a gift and it is conceptually a great product . 
i finally tracked down the only possible culprit ,  which is this product . 
whatever that means ?  i did move the content of the package around before opening . 
it really isn t hard because of the awkward layout of my yard . 
i was in the market for a new stand mixer . 
i couldn t think of anyone to give these to ,  so i am returning them . 
not this time . because of its awful design ,  we never played it . 
also ,  the thing didn t stick to dashborard either . waste of my money . 
it may be something to do with the design of the head set . 
once the bag system is empty the entire unit will be tossed . 
however ,  the books are kind of boring without the sounds .  .  . so ya just can t win with this system . 
you ve got to get the schedules right to be a serious contender . 
this should have been fixed before being released . 
that must not be comfortable for my cat to step on at all . 
no most of the time ,  it is just too much aggravation so i use the old hand crank one . 
and they ll eventually learn how to better pack these tiles . 
i had to go over each space a couple of times for this sand to get sucked up . 
the motion sensor works well so anything trips it off . 
the only thing this would do is keep the back of the phone from getting a lot of scratches . 
i like my body the way it is ,  thankyouverymuch . 
well that s the last i saw of him . 
the shipping was almost as much as the proudct . 
the case is nice but i m not a huge fan of the fit . 
cannot place entire blame on hogue as other weapons might be more compatible . 
now ,  i refuse to buy them at all . 
i just wish i could see the results they were raging about sooner . 
use sally hansen s honey wax with cloth strips . 
there is no way to accurately measure oneself for a cervical collar . 
the last shipment that amazon sent to me was with the product past it s best before date . 
like everyone has said ,  its a beautiful looking game ,  but thats about the best part . 
i really wanted this to work ,  it s exactly what i wanted . 
they are basically half granola ,  half gooey coffee tasting crap . 
you can pick each cereal with your fingers like a penny and it feels hard . 
annoying to say the least and thank you amazon for being so amazing and taking both headsets back !  . 
not wrapped in plastic or any type of packaging . 
the blue part has held up but i would not buy this again . 
i think i will sell it on ebay and get a num_extend
i guess if you are looking for an annually disposable item this will work for a while . 
those who are health conscious might want to take note of this . 
but they just stop working after about two to three months . 
i will contact amazon to see if anything can be done . 
i changed the filters and the problem just continued to worsen . 
i couldnt cast this without it tangling and casuing a bundle of line . 
this is the worst tea kettle i ve owned . 
they did come individually packed but they did not smell that great . 
the phone was too big when i put it in my pocket and could battery use a cover . 
i tried in on three different types and colors of carpet . 
it does cover the screen well but not in the matter i wanted . 
if it s around your neck ,  the clip is in the way . 
you collect the keys by passing the linear obstacle courses obviously . 
niagara s return policy says they only accept returns in unopened ,  original packaging ,  so i guess i m stuck with it . 
that isn t even the biggest problem with it . 
other reviewers were right here .  .  . after a few months they start to pull the hair  went dull i guess  . 
i ve heard so many great things about this product ,  i couldn t wait for it to arrive . 
after reading the ingredient list i m not so sure . 
got this as part of an offer with a blaster rifle  which is awesome ,  btw  . 
and to top it all off it can be used as a mediocore phone . 
i was happy for it to be out of my house ,  and no longer taking up the space . 
the toy smells great but my american bulldog tore it apart in minutes . 
while there are some really nice improvements in the design e . g . 
however ,  i ,  personally ,  am much more concerned about the acesulfame potassium ,   a . p .   sweetener in this product . 
when i took this product i had restless nights and bad dreams . 
as much as i wanted a longer cord ,  this isn t it . 
this is one of those times . pros : it is built well ,  i will say that . 
very disappointed .  .  .  .  . will cost almost as much to mail product back for replace or refund . 
i thought i was going to like this iron but it wasn t worth the nothing i paid for it . 
next time i ll travel i ll just purchase the calming spray . 
amazon needs to fix their wizard; this makes me hesitant to purchase other auto parts from them . 
i hope the smell is great as well .  .  . havent gotten it yet . 
god knows how much more you will have to spend to fix the issues this stuff creates . 
first ,  the lid does not line up with the base . 
and thats where we really stand between ratings . 
i m really disappointed to learn it has oats and barley in it . 
found the serial cable to be much more reliable than this horrible piece of equipment . 
mines out in the garage all busted up and useless ,  including extra polishing stones . 
i only got the ipad cable i didn t receive this one !  i totally forgot about this one . 
he ran it around the house and then outside ,  but within about an hour ,  the remote stopped working . 
didn t have time to mess with it ,  left for work with a not charged phone !  . 
i followed instructions for using the light brown . 
the lids that screw on and off with the glass ones just seem to function better and easier . 
i have a yorkie and it didn t help at all . 
but does not connect to my mac steadily ,  which needs frequent restarting of my mac . 
this is an easy indication of a poorly made filter . the warming filter is pretty cool . 
that electrical wiring can also carry a lot of noise from electrical appliances and even from light dimmers . 
the sizing as far as the length was fine ,  but the top was way too tight on my foot . 
bought this to help get rid of a horrible smell in my closet . 
it is super soft as well  see uploaded photo  . 
it messed up my brownie s too  !  !  !  yuck .  . im going to stay away . 
so ,  canon will not be warrantying this for you . 
i used this headset num_extend for a month before finally giving them back to the hub to return them . 
i should have used some common sense prior to purchasing .  . it just seemed like such an easy item to use . 
just ate it for dinner tonight and boy was it completely unimpressive . 
i loved it since i got it in october . 
purchased this to serve as monthly maintenance for my dog . 
so i am still stuck with a total broken items . 
i love beef jerky ,  so i was really looking forward to these ,  but i was so disappointed . 
it s a fiber laxative ,  not a candy bar . 
and for good reason ,  they don t stay on or last with the toy . it s unstable and the wheels don t roll . 
i ve tried less grounds ,  coarser grinds ,  you name it and it doesn t seem to help . 
it also felt uncomfortably tight in some areas and too loose in others . 
also ,  has a bit of a chemical aftertaste . 
if you buy this item it will last you around num_num weeks . 
but there were a couple of pretty places with some nice graphics ,  that is the only positive . avoid . 
it seems to have quite a bit of sediment . 
i had one image slightly higher and one slightly slower than the other . 
i am very disappointed what a bummer because zebras and bling are my favorite thing . 
after that ,  forget it !  !  burn failures galore . use another brand . 
they each have the same missions except for car parts . 
then it turns into a white ,  flaky powdery coating . 
if your main character dies ,  the game is over . 
buying this device right now would be foolish . 
wait until the jedi fiasco is figured out ,  too . 
i just attached it to my backseat headrest with about num_num inches of slack . 
i called amazon and they did issue me a refund . 
so it will likely not receive the weaker nws signals . 
blad came unsharpened and will not hold an edge . 
after washing this shirt ,  it shrank way too much . 
if you want to listen to nothing but bass beats ,  buy this now . 
now before you start screaming at me ,  i like racing games . 
the feeling you have is like applying any other oil . 
overall ,  i wouldn t be able to use it for anything . 
i might return them if they will take them back . 
i don t want my child eating paint of any kind . 
i was really bummed ,  usually i use energizing teas as a pick me up . 
first ,  a big thank you to amazon for providing this forum . 
num_num year warranty . died in num_extend well versed in it equipment . 
i will not buy it again when it breaks and don t recommend you buy it now . 
the phone won t go into the mount with a bumper on it . 
if i was seeking an alternative protein to whey and i couldn t eat pea then i d look at hemp . 
it still is a good buy for the price but simply not taht elegant . 
cant close it and listen to music because it always shuts it off . 
they seemed to hold up well in the dishwasher ,  and they served their purpose well . 
this is impossible even just by imagining it . 
sleep is still impossible and so is functioning throughout the day . 
definately not the appropriate size for a full size air rifle or firearm . 
we don t need girls trying to be like lohan at the age of num_extend
these earclips fit nicely around the ears and perform that function well . 
the idea behind our decision was that it would help him learn the concept of cost . 
i really wanted to like them ,  but i will never purchase them again . 
also the character is so slow in almost everything he does ,  running , changing weapons ,  stealing cars ,  etc . 
if i were you i wouldn t pay more then $ for it . 
this case did not want to stay on my phone at all . 
after playing it i was kind of dissapointed . 
i purchased this product about num_num years ago . 
they were bitter and just not good for a soup base . 
have to wear shirts over them and these bras don t really flatter . 
i m under num_extend but it will not stay closed even when tied . 
it s one of the weaker green teas you ll ever drink . 
they are gluten free and they travel well . 
the cushion measures about num_extend thick ,  but when placed in the chair it s effective depth is much more . 
i will have to check the valve two or three times to get a proper read . 
it did not feel smooth on my eyes at all . 
bought this to replace my red ryder after the cocking lever went out after many years of use . 
i must have been doing something wrong because it did not work at all for me . 
i have used the serum for over a month now . 
i tried one of the think thin creamy peanut butter gluten free bars . 
i was desperate to find a cure for my oily ,  large pore ,  acne prone skin . 
this case was very poorly designed ,  my advice as a galaxy s ii owner is not purchase this case . 
an that is when the game gets better . b  quests aren t many and are not fun . 
the matt itself doesn t provide a lot cushion . 
i was very happy with it for a few days . 
i have been using alterna caviar antiaging volume shampoo with seasilk for years . 
so ,  i would simply say that tastes vary . 
gets cold fast and ice cream in no time . 
i did everything possible that was not hardware invasive ,  you name it . 
the tail is ok and i will use it . 
i bought a couple of these chargers for use in our company vehicles . 
costing me about $ or so . don t trust belkin at all now . 
it won t sharpen scissors but it is a whiz on knives . 
tried several adjustments ,  just couldn t make it work for me . 
they informed me of a known issue with the software and told me to download a patch . 
i have heard other people have had success with it but we did not . 
what are you going to do about this ?  ?  ?  also ,  instructional dvd has no video . 
i replaced with sigma and couldn t be happier . 
but after applying this makeup you can see them clear as day . 
i did turn up the source volume but the hissing sound is still bad . 
it is impossible for those molecules to penetrate the skins surface . 
the new one needs num_extend no problems in over num_num years other than it has developed a humming sound . 
the old formula had leaves on the bottle and left my hair soft and light . 
i bought the utensil holder several years ago and it is long gone . 
fedex ,  ups ,  or usps with tracking  is highly recommended . 
stay away from this unfinished game there are better . 
once you open the box ,  will find a device much smaller than what you thought it would be . 
big deal ,  it doesn t work either . it will not work with voip phone systems ,  at all . 
i wish you much luck and hope it does . 
the paints colors are light hues at best . 
just let go and let the hay fall where it may . 
that seems to fail the basic measure  nice pun ,  right ?   of the product . 
this includes cars that came with toy and other small cars we ve tried . 
buy a different rc instead ,  this one is only fit for trash day . 
i keep a treat block in it so he has a reason to venture inside of it . 
however ,  after pairing it with the phone ,  i immediately heard it signalling that the battery was almost dead . 
it has enough power to blow the walls down or hear all at a whisper . 
the eq isn t custom ,  so you are out of luck if none of the presets work for you . 
they did a fine job getting the pedal to me across the country . 
i m nursing a num_num month old baby ,  and i can t be eating teflon unknowlingly . 
and the taste wasn t all that great ,  and the texture was more chewy than it should be . 
i ordered my normal size and they are strangling . 
the problem comes when i need to remove it to place in a charging or playback cradle . 
the blossom style is lost and it is very distracting . 
from what i read about metropolis street racer i expected a solid racing game with speed but got neither . 
however ,  the other cable did not work on my num_extend lcd display num_extend x num_extend
a few days later ,  the other side followed right along . 
there was a nice chili taste ,  not too strong ,  and a clean lime taste . 
i m sure it has potential with other cats though but i regret buying it . 
when i saw that amazon carried it ,  i was thrilled . 
in my opinion ,  the game is not playable in its current state . 
it s cheap and you never have to worry about using too much data . 
my foot slides side to side in them . 
i have had other brands which tasted better . 
these have no funky taste ,  or after taste ,  but i think they are quite plain . 
beth hilson should be spinning in bette hagman s grave . i am a highly experienced baker . 
the band adjuster broke ,  ,  didn t some of the bands i wanted to adjust . 
i love cashews ,  but emerald sea salt and pepper cashews have too much pepper on them for me . 
we couldn t even swallow that first bite blech . 
i tried science diet ,  which worked but she didn t like it very much . 
with an oxy pad ,  you can literally see all the dirt and gunk on the pad after you re done . 
stop !  do not do that !  this game is a horrible waist . 
this is a nice ,  small ,  inexpensive hub with clear instructions . 
its minimum bottom size for pot is num_extend num_extend in  . 
he keeps bringing the toy back to me for help . 
maybe she was being polite ,  or maybe she really liked it . 
usually i would have to power the range expander off and back on ,  then reboot my pc . 
bought this phone because it was advertised as new . 
to the rubbish with frozen dinners i suspect . 
it was like it literally changed the texture . 
that s not a good way to get a reviewer on your side . 
i even double checked the ingredients because i thought aspartame or some other fake sweetener was in it . 
put the double bag into the middle of the leg ,  grab both ends and shake . 
instead of just picking events you want to play ,  you have to drive around to the one you want . 
the products are tiny and labeled  sample only not for retail sale  . 
there is absolutely no reason to put it in food and nothing that contains it should be considered healthy . 
this came in a totally different color what advertised and the fabric was thin and cheap . 
trust me ,  you don t want to pay money to be an unpaid tester of alpha quality software . 
i started the program ,  and it locked up my computer . 
my music cuts out so badly that it sounds like . 
it s made of flimsy nylon like a halloween costume . 
i thought they d go for these as they love the microwaveable mac and cheese . 
i am used to rail mounted bi pods and this is my first bayonet mount . 
even my husband had difficulty getting them out . 
apps that the  app store  fails to offer . overall ,  the phone is very smooth . 
it is difficult to manuver around a nose with this short little trimmer . it is very easy to clean . 
over and over . it is a shame that a game this much fun is so difficult to play . 
however ,  after one wash in cold water ,  they will barely fit a two year old . 
i m pretty sure the num_num hour batttery will last between charges since i don t drive long distance much anyways . 
killed some ants ,  but some were just running around in the dust . 
looks like other people had the same problem . 
the water doesn t seem to flow on its own . 
i didn t think too much about it until i washed washed her and sprayed it again . 
for me ,  it really didn t help smooth out fine lines at all . 
i cannot eat it without sloshing down plenty of liquids . 
i opened the console ,  i liked what i saw . 
i absolutely love their caramel syrup and pancake syrup . 
i like a bold ,  robust coffee  particularly the new orleans coffee with chicory or french roast  . 
arrrgggghh . also the num_num would lose lock all the time when running in even moderate tree cover or heavy clouds . 
and another side note :  don t use condoms unless you have to ,  that s what always gives me yeast infections . 
this is exactly word for word ,  comma for comma ,  dot for dot . 
do yourself a favor and don t waste your time . 
the larger ones sometimes have the neck snap so i thought this might be the answer . 
not at all happy and initiating a return . 
the recent ones seem fragile . so ,  we are switching to the stainless steel french presses made by another company . 
no just one bottle but two in the same day . 
now perplexed ,  i got out my measuring bowls and poured two quarts of water into it . 
this is apparently a listing error by amazon . 
you have to hold your nose when you take it . 
i think it requires at least num_num months of use to see any noticeable results . 
it would be nice if the list of messages spoken by this toy was listed in the description . 
i paid less than seven dollars for mine two years ago . 
the gloves are great ,  if the seller is a reputable one . 
it s not worth the money and doesn t seem like it ll protect a phone at all . 
by the end of the standing time it was cooling off and wasn t cooked . 
by reading it ,  i thought i was getting the dispenser and a refill . 
we do not use the included seat belt strap ,  which was much too short . 
this thing drains its battery doing absolutely nothing . 
sturgeon s law states that % of everything is crap . 
many gel brushes are nylon and acetone will melt frizz and fray the bristles . 
i don t understand how something so simple could go so wrong . 
num_num star is too much credit for this horrible put together . 
i just thought i d like a new shiny stainless steel percolator for the kitchen ,  which i did get . 
please don t waste your money on this toy . 
i ,  personally ,  didn t like the music in the game ,  so i turned it off . 
i purchased this cream ,  and the box advertised that it would tighten skin and fade brown spots . 
i like the size and portability but if it doesn t work then i can t use it . 
i might add if you tighten this unit too tightly it leaks . 
i told him ,  and now he s even more ticked at me . 
does nothing to protect phone ,  rubber was warped and only a cosmetic item . 
luckily ,  i was able to return it to the store for a full refund . 
you have a brief moment in a tank that controls like an awkward mess . 
the stick ends up banging and marking up the walls . 
it s like putting a water on ur hair . 
granted ,  it only works with the xbox ,  which is somewhat lame . 
i was expecting better ,  keeping the good netgear reputation in mind . 
the only good aspect to these candy bars are that they are gluten free but they do contain soy . 
it s important to make sure the basket is seated all the way with a click . 
we also used to have a nonstick all clad frypan that we threw away after two or three years . 
the only way it would be usable in my household would be to create an enclosure for it . 
not all boxers are the same as ea would like you to think . 
i would never have ordered it if i d know this . 
sorry kitchenaid i hope you read this your product sucks . 
i ended up buying a more expensive international voltage straightener . 
the food in the oven picks up the smell . 
if you re like me and want a little caffeine ,  avoid this tea . 
not sure that s even legal . anyway ,  when i took the cover off my watch ,  it started working again . 
num_num days ,  no internet for the wired or the wireless computer with this router on . 
the suffering is also scary ,  but not like silent hill num_extend
if you want to spend money ,  by tauma oil instead . 
i m not a huge fan of the reflectivity if i m going to add a screen protector . 
when you re on your horse ,  the camera recenters to what seems to be a large angle toward the sky . 
i had to take a heavy grinding wheel to make it sharp . 
i purchased this food because i have num_num cats ,  and they were throwing up a lot . 
i had to go get a special shampoo to get rid of this greasy look . 
i played true crime and it was soo much better than this . 
to me its just dumb to waste money on headsets when you have a good one for cheaper . 
ordered another for my wife off the standard pages . pros :  no animals killed in making this product . 
i ordered the dockers dark marl assort for my brother . 
this is not good for spices as they will not keep well if the container is not sealed . 
the chest was tight and then neck didn t need any adjustment at all . 
this product smells terrible and it worked about as good as products from the drugstore . 
left side has no spots at all ! a note on price :  i noticed the price on the serum fluctuates significantly . 
they do not have the poky parts to the squish balls . 
if you want to try this game ,  wait until it hits the bargain bins . 
none of the num_num i received were the same as the item pictured . 
i received this as a wedding gift ,  and was excited to use it to broil salmon . 
i expect the red marking to soon disappear making it all but impossible to read too . 
every once in a while i ll try to tolerate a bottle again hoping i change my taste . 
i work at a game store ,  and see more used nba lives ,  then i do cars on the streets . 
i had no issue with peeling them off either . 
these definitely did not hold up for num_num months of wear . 
once it overheats it begins to turn itself off and back on . 
i have put it down several times ,  waited a few weeks ,  picked it up again and tried once more . 
very disappointed but will keep to wear around the house . 
it s going to be very disappointing when i come home later . 
my biggest compaint is that there is no midrange . 
they are ruined after num_num use no matter how careful you are . 
i guess i will just leave the cabinet door open when in use . good luck if you buy this . 
find something you truly love and buy that . 
i rarely make poor purchases ,  but this one was a turkey . 
wacoal really works for me ,  but it costs so much more . 
also ,  i don t have any medical condition ,  just dry hands . 
make the lines under my eyes even worse . 
ive only had my blender since march num_num and it seems i too am cursed with paddle issues . 
except for the shirt being too long before washing it ,  it fit okay . 
i found it easier and faster to just set the primer yourself . 
if you love long segments of nothing but talking this game is for you . 
it uses a proprietary battery as well . as far as games go ,  take a look at the release list yourself . 
it made my hair feel like disgusting !  like straw !  my hair has never felt so nasty . 
i only used this for bringing our puppy home and one trip later to a pet store . 
problem was that the human had to hold her finger on it  no off and on switch  . 
it did not make me feel any happier or joyful . 
i came to my senses; it s time for a change . good service by amazon and good return policy . 
the unit was charged ,  but suddenly deaf to my dog s dulcet tones . 
i used these on clean dry skin too . 
i will either return or give this bra away . 
it is because you don t have to think for yourself !  its a  wham bam thank you ma m  ideology . 
so go figure  !  or just stay away from it anyway . 
the num_extend it turns out ,  had a broken corner . 
this made my normally straight ,  thick hair a frizzy ,  matted ,  horrid ,  tangled mess . 
the overall construction and material quality is very poor . 
the shoe is narrow at the toe and runs short . 
it does keep your skin moist ,  but it doesn t correct anything . 
i d recommend a rowenta iron which i used to have . 
but you shouldn t have to thin out a brand new tube of mascara to be able to use it . 
everyone fights together as a team in a team . 
lol we figured it out pretty quick ,  but then found out the bottom light ,  which is led is faulty . 
it most certainly will not work with all hot wheels cars . 
perhaps my dogs got a bad batch ,  but i m not buying this brand again . 
i have not used it because the cloth stripped the moisture and oils from my gun slide . 
it s a cute idea but did not last . 
i end up using a jim dunlop capo to pull bridge pins out . 
however ,  we will be looking for a better machine . 
love the smell of the cologne so i wanted to give this a try . 
i bought these in the shiny black color . 
i honestly cannot believe you like the sound on these . 
warranty on box says lifetime actual warranty is one year . 
when you read the solution ,  you don t go  ah ha !   you go  what the heck ?   . 
i used it once then threw the rest away . 
bought it at target ,  so looked forward to using it . 
don t know if it is the battery ,  or the ups itself . 
i bought num_num of these fans because of the reviews i have read here . 
plasma concentrations of lysine and arginine were assessed at the beginning  baseline  and end of the study . 
the red pictured here is not at all what the dishes look like . 
i had to give up eating them because they kept choking me . 
first off ,  let me say that the unit was extremely quiet and looks nice . 
rat on cat on nat on ant on mat . 
any casting class will be killed over ,  and over ,  and over . 
i just thought it would be much bigger . 
im a passion fruit addict so i pretty well know what tastes better and what doesn t . 
all i ended up with was a new pan with the same machine never working right after that . 
i could probably reverse my suv over this bottle without even cracking it .  .  . it s that solid . 
it s one of my favorite cereals . then the aftertaste caught me . 
i contacted the seller and wanted to return this product ,  and seller responded quickly . 
i ve used the product for about three years now .  .  .  . it s not like this is a season that s different . 
it is cheap enough to not be worth returning . 
it gave me a feel of a knock off product . 
the taste is bland and awful ,  i am not sure . 
i have purchased this product from a local retailer and the product does work . 
this is more than their recommended amount of one squirt . 
the slipper is attractive and fits to size . 
this made my hair gummy ,  greasy looking and flat as a pancake . 
he is a bog pup so i was looking for a larger bone for him . 
if leapfrog could improve on the  green go  button ,  it would be much better . 
even though there are hardly any cashews or cranberries in the first one . 
i m sure it was listed somewhere on the page ,  but i missed it . 
it always flattens back out but it s really a pain in the ah hum to use . 
fyi ,  those of you with square burners will not like this one . 
the fabric under the foot did not provide enough support . 
the only good thing is that it leaves your skin smooth but i don t think is worth the trouble . 
unfortunately i can t order it any more due to amazon switching from fedex shipping to fedex  smartpost  . 
during the natural bacterial fermentation process of milk or cream ,  lactose is converted into lactic acid . 
the camera itself may seem cute but the images are very low res . 
i like mine with a little fresher ,  slightly rouge effect . 
i think this leads children to become bored with it quickly . 
it was very traumatic to say the least . 
i like that it comes in different colors and patterns . the problem is that it s horribly uncomfortable . 
the formula in the bottle i got off amazon was this sticky white gel substance . 
my wife uses this and she feels a razor is better than this product . 
i love the shape of the mouse and the fact that it s wireless . 
but it just never stays snuggly in his ear . 
as for the taste ,  it is very very fishy  and not a good fishy ,  more of a rotten fishy  . 
it advertised that it contained no high fructose corn syrup . 
they are wood with colored paper covering the wood . 
i really urge everyone to stay far away from this product if you value your cassettes . 
as if i put gel in it not a foaming lotion . 
the case is sturdy enough construction ,  and does not feel cheaply made . 
i had this cage for my gerbils when i was less educated about them . 
my advice is unless you love these kind of games i would just rent it . 
unfortunately the motor died after a few months . 
i was told to return it to the pet store which i did without any problems . 
must line up meticulously with charger unit to num_extend
i don t know why people like to have colored num_extend players . 
it does seem to falter a bit ,  and also the game is not the best in control . 
and the other places ,  well that will never happen . 
file the ends of the stamper lightly before first use . 
this is the only item i ve ever purchased that she can t manipulate well . 
i was only able to complete one wheel before the product was in three piece on the asphalt . 
the rubber outer shell is horrable it seems to keep trying to come off . 
the good side to this product is that it smells nice . 
i think the curve on each arm rest needs to be a bit deeper . 
but then so is fruit of the loom . 
i give it num_num stars since it is such a good food for cats . 
i really can t even get an idea of what s behind me because this one in particular ,  keep moving . 
the sound is pretty good the first time around ,  but then it just starts sounding tired . 
i even tried replacing the fixtures they were in . 
i decided to go out and buy a microwave instead for under $
we couldn t add enough salt and pepper to mask it ,  and it s salty enough already . 
not sure why these are labled  banana  because they have zero flavor of any kind . 
they also will not draw on the tub unless the side is completly dry . 
i tried these in sub num_num degree temps and all they did was make by boots uncomfortable . 
aside from a few typos ,  it is accurate . 
so i sent it back to them after a crash had broken a part ,  again paying for shipping . 
eh ,  skirt is really short !  top is an odd fit . 
they threaded it ,  so opening ,  closing ,  and cleaning are a chore . 
i really ,  really wish i could write a good review for this game . unfortunately ,  i can t run it . 
it met my expectations until it stopped working after six months . 
if you ever buy nail tek make sure you get the bottle with the brush .  .  .  . much easier application without waste . 
save your money and spend $ and get a higher quality product . 
i must have read more than % of the reviews on amazon about the product . 
i ll stick to petsmart so that returns are easier . 
i glued it back ,  and it worked for a while . 
enter the newest contestant in the ugly pageant . 
i have almost nothing in it so its not like its stretched out causing alot of pressure . 
i like the color alot but the flip flops dont look the same . 
the screen looks great and digitizer is responsive . 
the metal is thin and cheap ,  bending easily . 
and wore her teeth down in the process ,  blunting them . 
but anker personnel did give me a full refund when i contacted them about my problem . 
but instead of a nice pot of coffee . 
this inefficient  sifter  is probably best used as a toddler s sand toy . 
i thought that having it so cheap to make at home would be great . 
i can t put my shoes inside ,  it s made for just feet . 
there are also quite a few firmware bugs ,  but some of them did get fixed with newer revisions . 
the weaved end is big and clunky for any note taking app ,  so the search will continue . 
i opened them all up to check the functionality of them ,  and unfortunately only one of them opened flawlessly . 
i expect they will ignore me and i ll probably never see it again . 
there are hardly any ties to or trademarks of the series . 
upon first shot the whiskers flew out of the biscuit . 
it s nice ,  but there are others that protect just as well without hindering the hardware buttons . 
the applicator is good ,  however  pointed tip ,  no brush for random bristles to stick out  . 
i have one for sale if anybody wants it . 
same thing happened love it when i spray it on then within minutes it s gone . 
as far as knowing how well this item performs ,  i have no idea . 
it came apart the first time i used it . 
great penetration on both g and a however security was a necessity . 
it says no where on the package to spray the pan . 
they did into your legs and leave marks and a swollen lump in your leg above the sock . 
do not buy if you expect actual big crystals !  !  . 
all come with spatulas to scrape them down . 
bough her a num_extend which she much prefers . 
if you own any other system ,  get it for that one . scoregraphics num_extend num_extend num_extend num_extend
i wanted to get off the proton pump inhibitor because of the side effects . 
it s pretty big too .  .  . double check measurements before you buy . 
he stood ,  leaned over the hole ,  and fell out head first . 
the first week s body count was num_num on neck breakers ,  oneelectrocuted . 
it would not stand up to any hard or even moderate use . 
i wear small sized opaque tights and they do not fit into the front pockets . 
if you re not sure of how your skin will react ,  try using baby oil in your bath first . 
we figured this would be a cute toy that she would enjoy but we were wrong . 
contacted the company after working on this project with my granddaughter . 
this works great ,  i use it on my nightstand . 
unfortunately ,  the post broke after a month and a half of usage . 
that s when i noticed they don t even look real . 
she really wanted a lite but comfortable sleeping pad for when we go on hiking trips . 
it also seems like a watch for a child . 
the clasp i just mentioned above is made out of plastic . 
i may take it out of their cage for awhile and give it back to them another day . 
unfortunately we gave it away before we had the new guy . 
as noted by others ,  the slime plugs up the schrader valve occasionally on new tubes . 
now i m using it up as a hand soap . 
finally we have the characters ,  who were uninterestingand didn t care whether they lived or died . 
since there were multiple companies selling the pa free butterbur ,  we bought num_num different ones that were different dosages . 
looks very sexy but the rhinestones fall off easy . 
these have a hard time standing up ,  and one of them seems to have an opposable thumb . 
to sum up ,  if you want single player action ,  stay away . 
no matter how hard we pushed ,  it was really hard to actually get any bubbles to come out . 
my fault that i didn t catch the  one  word in the description . 
its a total compelty different one . doesnt look nothing like this the one i recieved . 
get espn num_num becuase its better then this lame title . 
extremely difficult to get on and off the phone . 
the cut scenes look really good with the exception that there is no blood . 
after only wearing a few times the face of watch became horribly scratched . 
unfortunately i wore it before all of the above sank in ,  so i m stuck with it . 
i guess i ll break this thing up into catagories .  .  . graphics :  perfect example . 
i had my first chance to try this today ,  killing a wasp that got in the house . 
the phones are very comfortable to wear and fold up easily for compact storage in the provided case . 
italian love affair didn t apply nicely on my finger nails as other opi polishes . 
used this for a year and it made my eczema so bad it gave me new patches of it . 
i was very impressed with the look of this compared to the motorola roadster num_extend
i expected better ,  and will keep looking for some application where it eases a cleaning chore . 
i tried to make one but was unsuccessful . 
only one side clicks shut ,  leaving the other side freely open . 
if you have ever had even a decent cheap rice cooker before ,  you ll be shocked at this product . 
my husband and kids don t like the smell and my dog barked at me . 
i m going to have to give up on glamorise . 
after maybe num_num uses ,  it showed signs of corrosion . 
this one doesn t even come close to the quality of the old stuff . 
yet a lot of buyers will think to get the short arrows for the smallest archer s and their bows . 
i added heavy duty tape to keep it in place one night ,  when going out with a date . 
she does not shut off until you pick her up again and flip the switch . 
no problem ,  it ll only take a minute for me to research this . 
i read on the web that this was good for cleaning stainless steel sinks . 
the squeaker is a major choke hazard for any size dog and if ingested could be deadly . 
i watched youtube video s for how to s and followed the instructions . 
the shaft which goes into the ground is very solid and the whole unit is simple . 
it shampoos fine ,  but num_extend it is not a steam cleaner . 
this toy takes up too much room and is too much money . 
i hate to say this is not what i expected and the best i found . 
it just doesn t feel as safe as my old one . 
we have loved every nature s path product we ve tried up to this point ,  but geez . 
i am just warning you ,  buyer beware on this product . 
the use of sound and light  or lack of them  was excellent as well . 
needless to say ,  it did not load or read the disc i bought new from gamestop . 
a perusal of the linksys web site was met with equal frustration . 
there are no sights on this gun ,  and the scope shoots way too high . 
the only redeeming factor is that the melted top doesn t seem to affect the functionality . 
it took forever to get here and when it did it never worked . 
personally ,  i think this product is best for dudes who need a little bit of control and some shine . 
i would like itif it held up ,  and iot didn t . 
i thought that would be the perfect place to hang one of these . 
in addition ,  it gets filthy easily and oils don t clean off as easily as i would have expected . 
my baby loves to play with them in the bath . 
product arrived and it was already passed the expiration date . 
after an hour i have to remove them due to the pain when the headphones squeeze my head . 
it was at that time rated by up to four or fewer stars on the package to indicate quality . 
anything can be used as a weapon :  plants ,  skateboards ,  chainsaws ,  guns ,  lumber ,  golf clubs ,  etc . 
that pins you against either num_num human or computer controlled characters . 
and the some of the wrestler s entrance themes are off . 
the move to overseas production has really hosed up the quality of these jeans ,  though . 
if you must have this game then wait until it hits the bargain price range $ at best  . 
but i kind of think that is the way they are supposed to be  maybe  . 
i got these today .  . and tried to put on car . 
worked for about num_num months and then just stopped working . 
the food included in this kit contains rice ,  soybean meal ,  wheat ,  and beetpulp . 
the plastic interior shell is too hard to properly protect the phone . 
fully useable terrain ,  climb mountains ,  swim ,  get lost in the num_extend
wasted num_num days trying to set up wireless . 
this did not work as well for me as expected . 
my sister in law bought this for my daughter for her first birthday . 
even tied to the curtain rod it still swayed back and forth . 
you just can t go turn another radio on when you using satellite . 
not sure what activision was thinking by putting this out . 
the router has to be reset every day . 
this tapenade tastes of vinegar and vegetable oil ,  but sadly not of olive oil . 
same smell came from the bison flavor as well . 
i do not recommend this ,  would not buy again ,  and i hope this helps someone . 
so this was not a great product and the reviews never mentioned this . 
i knew they wouldn t be creamy because they lacked dairy ,  but they had a weird look and consistency . 
i bought this to record videos onto dvds . 
after one cycle ,  my shun santoku had large pieces missing from the blade . 
i enjoy brewing coffee at home and buy a variety of brands in varying price points . 
i naturally gravitate towards larger ,  clunkier items that suit my large frame . 
the hot air is not really hot enough to have any effect on thick or coarse hair . 
check how far your spout sticks out from the wall first . 
i charged it overnight and gave it a try . 
i m not sure about the brand name because no name was on them ,  but they completely sucked . 
we have much better results using the iq ball . 
sometime it doesn t work even though are only inches away . 
i had to remove all my music from my phone to correct the problem . 
i m forever looking for products that will moisturize it without weighing it down . 
i bought it to use with my uv light for when i do a french manicure . 
i m thinking about taking it out of my jeep . 
put this on my face and my dark marks got instantly darker so i stopped using it . 
sure ,  you battle a couple of foes ,  but you probably never will finish this game . 
i went on the zoe website to see how to read the code on the bottom of the can . 
too bad i can t ask for a refund . 
this is some sort of scam and amazon is doing nothing but letting it happen . 
this case is such a joke !  !  very cheap made . 
in summary ,  this is a decent tasting tea ,  not the best ,  but not bad . 
two of them are not fixeable due to the design . 
low temp is usually enough to keep my kit around num_extend but your environment may be different . 
i may not have big ears ,  but they re not small either . 
other than painting it there is nothing more to do with it . 
my butt was brutally murdered by scorpion the second i came in . 
after a few minutes in the bath ,  my skin began to tingle and burn . 
every shipment we get the cans are dented . 
this is also the first sims game that i have played as well . 
michelin makes an outstanding stealth blade that has the frame enclosed with a plastic frame . 
it always has air bubbles when it dries . 
i really like splinter num_extend is no splinter cell . 
i was able to use pliers to re attach it but the quality is poor . 
if you read the blurb regarding this product you will find that your pet will be ingesting  wholesale  ingredients . 
thinking i was sensitive i moved it to the living room but i needed to turn up the t . v . 
it cannot be changed to a google default . 
some people will react to it and others won t have any problem whatsoever . 
this was by far the worst nancy drew game yet . 
wearing them for any length of time leads to foot pain . 
i have it also on dreamcast and the sound and graphics are better . 
i have contacted seller several times to give them the chance to make things right with no response . 
but i seem to be in the group of users who have an allergic reaction to this product . 
i asked if they guaranteed that was the problem and they said yes . 
they all said these jeans run a bit large . 
they sort of work for awhile ,  but they aren t worth all that money . 
after havin those assisted open crkt s though ,  carrying this will bring you sour faces . 
i use it to and from the range where it doesn t need to be packed with other things . 
that is the only redeeming quality about these tongs . 
i got this product for my daughter who is one of those proactive gotta have types . 
that one didn t work either . we are returning both players . 
okay ,  i can set the timer to turn the potatoes several times . 
wine grapes aren t very sweet and when you press them ,  you get a thick ,  sourish juice . 
my nails are very thin and weak ,  and i have a horrible problem with peeling in particular . 
over time ,  the length of the charge is getting worse . 
however ,  the fact that the fabric strap lasted me about num_num hours forced me to give this one star . 
i wanted a second crate for crate training and bought this one because i thought they were comparable . 
everything was so small ,  especially the plates and cups . 
which reminds me .  .  . i use the cordless optical trackman and use it daily on a mac . 
i love neutrogena products but was really disappointed with this one . 
as though it didn t matter that i wasn t getting what i paid for . 
my son loved to play with this toy . 
this is still an okay fighting game though ,  which is why i gave it two stars instead of one . 
you see ,  some of your skills are raised per usage . 
if the watch isn t charged it is still readable at night ,  but barely . 
if you have slender legs ,  with large feet ,  look elsewhere . the truform medium fits ok but it s not very durable . 
plus artificial fruit put in milk just isn t a winning combination by any stretch of the imagination . 
the only way i see fit to best describe this game is by listing the pros and num_extend
it worked ok for num_num weeks ,  then it fell off . 
i am in the process of trying to return mine . 
i have returned and ordered barely there comfort bra . 
i m disappointed to report that my unit blew out after a few days of modest use . 
this pack has ended up being worse than my rechargeable batteries . 
the fact alone that it is held by sticky foam is not a good thing . 
the second ingredient in these treats is organic dehydrated cane juice and they are far too sweet . 
no wonder she keeps having it muesli for breakfast . 
it s been there since the num_num version . getting the control menu to keep my settings took a few attempts . 
it could fit on a guys arms whose is wider . 
they don t even really play with it the way it s supposed to be played with . 
i gave this razor two stars because it does work sort of . 
is it ? so ,  on goes my quest for a decent coffee maker . 
just wish the measurements more accurately reflected the actual space your dog has . 
pushing it all the way in only produced hum . 
i gave it to my husband because it hurts my tailbone . 
the word  terrible  is cringing for having to be associated with this product . 
i ran all patches ,  changed video modes ,  changed compatibility modes and nothing would work . 
did this for a week and my feet are soft and amazing like they were in my num_extend
these new cases break when i open them ,  so far two out of three . 
i would love the loud ,  the size ,  everything ,  but doesn t fit carbon bikes . 
it is also out of square in every conceivable way possible . 
appication is easy as usual and it gives a good decent darker shine . 
they had to reset all of the software . 
i have tried it in all different types of food and this supplement is like appetite repellent . 
and honestly its good just eaten as a midday or midnight snack . 
it was fully charged just not enough oomph . 
i took one bite and had to spit it out . 
the pockets are useless because the ends of the shawl only reach the elbow area . 
i like brita but this particular model is not the best . 
absolutely the worst immersion blender i ve ever owned . 
the rubber cleaning pad made it very easy to clean all the little holes . 
maybe i don t get the point with this . 
but i was so let down by this radio as it does nothing but play music and songs . 
i did not get the large  fun  container . 
at least that is what the game tells you . 
the material on this suit just did not hold up . 
charge time is excellent and use tune is great as well . 
then ,  don t even think about touching your head for the rest of the day or it s going to migrate . 
i will ,  however ,  keep them and use them for purposes other than for a litter box . 
the desktop pc plugged into the router with a cable worked ,  but not the wireless device . 
first of all ,  one large can of cleaner didn t even cover an entire num_extend rug . 
this keyboard is a classic example of microsoft fixing what ain t broke and coming up with a white elephant . 
when it arrived i went to plug it in and noticed one of the prongs was bent . 
what a bad game !  it stinks !  the create a sims is half way decent .  .  . but it still stinks . 
she is not one to be rough with her toys ,  and it gave out very quickly . 
well ,  i thought i was buying a good product ,  boy was i wrong . 
the prime is fine for me to hear ,  but the microphone is terrible . 
that s not the case here . the box includes two screen protectors and templates . 
when i got these toys today ,  the dog ,  a cacachon ,  loved them . 
i threw it away and to me ,  i ll never buy it again . 
it does deliver on nostalgia ,  but it is not a fun game to play . 
and it does not have enough power to charge my extended life battery only the standard laptop battery . 
the photosmart num_num works perfectly well with iphoto ,  as expected . 
so i came to amazon to look for it and thought i found it . 
the other is an odd ,  stunted plant ,  with misshapen leaves . 
this brush is probably great for a cat that s accustomed to having his teeth brushed . 
wish i d just bought a more expensive one . 
in less than num_num minutes it s literally gone . my husband adores this scent so i did a sleepy time experiment . 
once it comes off ,  the pump is useless . 
i don t appreciate a big company dirtying an otherwise great product with nasty chemicals . 
i am big busted so this bra will probably work for those who are smaller . 
we are going to try the barleans  greens chocolate mix instead . 
comparison to world s bestodor control :  better way wins . 
it s one of the coolest electric razors i ve seen . 
wireless headphones need to be able to work for at least num_num hours to be useful . 
did nothing to correct the yellow tones in my hair . 
i loved the original suikodens and konami is better than this . 
judgment :  a novelty item without much practical use . 
which falls off far too many times a day to count . 
just yesterday my foot was on the wire and i stood up . 
i prefer a more bitter and deeper chocolate flavor . 
i returned the product and got a refund . 
this tastes to me like imitation blueberries  it includes  organic blueberry flavor   . 
the first mission took us num_num weeks to fufill . 
what it did was take the lashes i have and sort of glue them together . 
if you have a good diet ,  with plenty of fresh vegetables ,  not sure of the reason for this product . 
if it wasn t so cheap to begin with i d send it back . 
the plastic was broken when i received it . 
my fav  cd product is the hair milk curl shampoo . 
i bought num_num of these thinking they were actual doan s machine and tool bars . 
i repeatly removed and then inserted the batteries in the charger and only one charged . 
quality seems good and value was high num_extend weeks later . 
i guess my dog just doesn t like the nylabones . 
i like the size of this roaster and that s about it . 
got this water fountain as a replacement for one that i had for years . 
but i would have paid a little more to have an lcd screen my daughter  or anyone  could see . 
the item looks great but because of home repair have not been able to use it . 
they did send me replacements once ,  but for the wrong phone . 
it is not the size in the picture posted above ,  its about half of that . 
after replacing the batteries ,  we tried to go to the website ,  which wasn t working . 
on the highest heat setting ,  it felt like the temperature only got to about num_extend
i played the first game and was impressed by it . 
i have tried several locations in the room . 
the artwork is beautiful but it would have been a plus to have more from different eras . 
at full blast it was hard to hear in a crowd . 
i even changed my rating from num_num stars to num_extend
an the frickin bag that comes with it is too danged small . 
i tried to like it ,  i really really tried ,  but it s so badly made i couldn t like it . 
that s the issue i had with this mascara . 
i never had to do this with my netgear router and the same win xp laptop . 
i ve seen some that are straight with one size per rod . 
the other reviews are correct ,  this thing is worthless out of the box . 
i dont know if this is common with netgear products ,  but this one is not worth the price . 
perhaps the longer battery life was a mistake as it seemed to go to sleep every few seconds . 
my main gripe is the amount of maintenance needed . 
well a few seconds after he gets going he will fall flat on his face everytime . 
is not designed for the desert eagle that has been the current model for over num_num years . 
or buy one here for far less than this . 
it s a weak blend with an overpowering aroma . 
my daughter has asked for a violin for months and she loves this num_extend
i just recently checked other brands and purchased the premiere brand . 
i received this product and in a timely manner however ,  i was very disappointed . 
i can t get my protective case on it now because of that . 
and they got really hard in just a couple of days ,  i will not be buying these again . 
they didn t respond to the catnip on it either . 
was a great little pump ,  while it lasted . 
changing to a different  and frankly cheaper looking  cable fixed this issue . 
it say s four inches thick , but it s more like three inches or less ,  and flat . i won t buy another . 
it s also really light and dry .  .  .  .  .  .  . i like buttery popcorn . 
this bra was too tight around and very high cut under the arms . 
do not waste your money on this product ,  worst purchase i have ever ordered . 
i have been surprised and dissappointed in this battery . 
maybelline has been doing some great drugstore mascara s so i have no idea why they would release this . 
the townsfolk have their set schedules that they follow . 
i get killed by a spider that drops down behind me . 
i hate it and gave it away to someone . 
if you cannot tolerate whey or milk proteins in any form ,  then the best advice is to fuggedaboutit . 
i have no idea how this stuff has so many good reviews . 
it is better than num_num stars but not quite at num_num stars either . 
also ,  the box is smaller than most cereal boxes . 
you can blaze through the included scenarios fairly quickly if you put your mind to it . 
took it to the range the first time with one rifle and magazines in the pouches . 
i tried cutting different foods then reintroducing them and no change . 
this terrarium set up is doomed to failure . 
be grateful if you can get it to do that . the carrying case is snazzy though . 
one of the two sides stopped working after a few months . 
i can t even use baby oil on my face . 
i should have known this was way too good to be true . 
i have a sony num_extend num_extend dvd burner with the latest firmware installed . 
the compartment is too hard to open ,  almost break a nail everytime i tried to open it . 
it produces lot of hissing noise and static . 
then the black top doesn t screw in very well either . 
but if you re in dire straits with a stressed out dog ,  i definitely wouldn t hang your hopes on these . 
the only time he shows excitement is when i sing along and finish the song . 
it looked decent ,  but he had no control . 
there is no reason to engage in this type of lying . 
the screen is kind of hard to see . 
the balls are slow to come out ,  if they came out at all . 
secondly ,  the silicone on the bottom portion stretches and doesn t stay on . 
it looks just like other belts that once apart ,  turned out to be just like that . 
we have had this toy for about one hour now . 
i took it back to target ,  a year later ,  and got store credit for it . 
it definitely has no pain relieving qualities ,  only pain distracting ones . 
i was given this as a gift ,  and i dont find it all that impressive . 
red octane simply took beatmania ,  and made it for white people to enjoy . 
i guess i order the wrong type ,  but it did look the same . 
unfortunately ,  i can t change my original review . results are as num_extend htc car num_extend connects every time . 
call me picky ,  but i d say measuring a liquid is only half the task . 
if anybody have any suggestions ,  please let me know . 
the taste is fine but that doesn t matter if you can t use it . 
i thought this travel wallet would be good for pants without a belt . 
i was expecting a lot less colorcast than what i got . 
acai berries have fewer antioxidants than grapes or blueberries ,  and no credible evidence exists supporting the other miraculous claims . 
within an hour ,  my feet also began to hurt; which turned into some serious pain . 
it was very hard to place in the shoe to where it was effective . 
on top of that ,  the onions did not even taste fresh ,  they were bitter . 
i just bought a new galaxy siii to replace the nexus . 
i would make sure you know the kind of drill bits these fit and not waste your time . 
since i didn t wear it ,  i cannot talk about the quality . 
potato head s hat on backwards in order for it to stay on . 
totally lost its shape after only a few weeks of use . 
i  stuck  with it for about num_num years . 
i went back to the air can dusters . 
this thing is a complete waste of money . after i returned it ,  i bought an intel pocket concert . 
pyrex measuring cups are the best brand available ,  and they are made in the usa . 
this price was cheaper than anywhere i ve found for this quantity so i ordered . 
this helps to break up that flat sided cube look . 
i thought this was a really good switch . 
not so .  .  .  . not so .  .  . i would highly recommend a different litter . 
tried wearing them for a day and the didn t help at all . 
this was a great product for me until my skin started to become irritated . 
it does not do a great job of sealing out the light . 
i bought this thing to replace a samsung that sounded great but was a little clunky . 
that is one of the worst things about this game . 
it seemd to be periodically automatically releasing and renewing the ip settings . 
double checked it was not debris and it looked to be manufacturing defects . 
this doll s great but maybe they should change her name . 
these were very dry ,  poor quality chocolate and mediocre marshmallow . 
the device has to stay sideways in order for it to work . 
i have my concerns about using it again . 
i think they should be labeled as num_num each . 
this did not make any difference in skin tone . 
it seems flimsy ,  and plasticky but again ,  it was a cheap scope . 
i applied a little bit on to my face and i felt like $ with all the sparkles etc . 
not my favorite  cheapo  sunglasses that s for sure . 
i feel alone and depressed after looking forward to using this product . 
the ordinary nomad num_num has a more useful display ,  but the sound really sucks . 
this is my first time ever using fabric softener and so far i really like it . 
this was a waste of money for my use . 
i recently tried instead after seeing a positive review for it in fashion magazine . 
more importantly ,  the bag provides protection in terms of padding ,  not structural support . 
i do like the hover vechiles that jak can  jak  anytime they fly over head . 
when this was shipped ,  most of the bottles leaked out and the box was a mess . 
i have to start out by saying i have the siren sport goretex version . 
i bought this iron based on the recommendations here and was terribly dissapointed . 
there s absolutely nothing that compelled me to get a micro . 
following the pediatrician s recommendation ,  i was looking for vitamin d and calcium for my num_num year old . 
as soon as i turned the bottle to pour it into my hand ,  it all gushed out . 
these sound great and everyone hears me well . 
this only lasted for about ten minutes then i actually started to feel stoned . 
i don t know what is up with that . 
i have emailed buzzbee on several occasions and had absolutely no response . 
i got it because it was cheap ,  it was alright . 
instead ,  criterion decided to put street names ,  really ?  !  ,  driving at say num_extend
good luck !  and well timed grenades no longer flip them over or stop them . 
now ,  it sits in my drawer and collects dust . 
when bc first released the gf mixes this cake mix was gluten free and soy free . 
my gummy vitamin c tastes better than these . 
real bad design !  !  there is no making this junk work . 
there are way better card games out there for the same or less money . 
the previous pair was bought on sale at a local fred meyer . 
it gets chilly ,  even in the early fall . 
i called customer service and they sent a replacement . 
not all racing games seem to be the best behind the wheel . 
the unit occasionally locks up and must be reset ,  even though i stay current with firmware and driver upgrades . 
it s like giving him an oversized piece of heavy rubber . 
however ,  there are a few problems that i had with this robe . 
the guard was so complex to attach and detach that it took num_num minutes each time to do num_extend
num_num in the style magazine survey so i thought maybe they have improved their stuff . 
but when they arrived ,  i realized they were way too short for what i wanted . 
i need to find someone whose eyes are really far apart and give them to them . 
adequate collagen helps your skin stay more youthful . 
this means that software which expects me to specify a serial port can t select this device ,  making it useless . 
the top of the tower that opens  the bedroom  won t close completely . 
it just so happened i was coming down with a cold when these arrived . 
well ,  after just over two years it stopped doing that too . 
hesitant to order again even though my kids really liked it . 
this gba game is quite challenging ,  but that s not my problem with it . 
i could not attach the clips to the frame with the fabric as they were too tight . 
i am very disappointed but refuse to go up to a giant size num_num or so . 
i guess you get what you pay for . 
i remember when a lot of cold steel was made in the us . 
immediately a screen is shown of alucard running to the castle  which you unfortunately have no control over  . 
you have to move that ridiculously small light switch to make the light go on and num_extend
it seems to be about either desperate ,  or greedy companies trying to capture customers into their markets forever . 
i threw them away !  !  did not like the material it was made of either . 
this isn t as annoying as it sounds ,  but i wish i could ve held on to more . 
then i started to get the nauseous feeling . 
i bought this film not knowing that it s an involved process to apply to my phone . 
it doesn t work as described for pet odors . other than satisfying my curiosity ,  this was a total waste of money !  . 
i give it num_num stars for being a good idea .  .  .  . but needs work . 
this scarf is listed as being pashmina but it is in fact made of viscose ,  aka rayon . 
this is somewhat like the effect you see when you place two mirrors facing each other . 
i don t need those things simulated ,  nor do i need to run through every practice . 
they have a sliding ,  pull back and release motion that connects two rods to form the top roof bars . 
i have very thick very curly color treated hair ,  age num_extend
if i even picked it up the cover would just slide right off . 
was expecting something a lot better after reading the reviews . 
however ,  the worst of the bubbles did disappear in about num_num hours . 
i can safely say that this will satisfy a chocoholics need for chocolate . 
there are tons of reports of it cracking from simple use ,  such as texting . 
the older dog num_extend seemed to have trouble eating it it may have been too hard for him . 
i like it because it s nice and simple and does not require batteries . 
i had one of the poppers that has full holes in it ,  not long loops like this one . 
it s not too big or heavy to stick on the fridge or in a drawer . 
yet i cannot go for a walk outside in the rain without the color running . 
this may work as a trickle  charger ,  but that s no help whatsoever . 
if you travel very very light it might work for you . 
fast srevice and delivery ,  just product not what i could use again . 
maybe i ll get used to them ,  but so far i feel it was a bad call . 
this abydoll is very big as large runs as xlarge . 
on mine ,  the little tabs don t seem to open all the way . 
i have a le creuset dutch oven ,  which is ceramic . 
these cookies are very rich ,  oily and smell so strong that you can smell them through a ziplock bag . 
msg has been given new names ,  among them  natural flavoring .   could it be that this mix contains num_extend
the handle is way to flimsy to use when the case is full of cars . 
each batch of raw material is subjected to identity ,  potency ,  microbiological ,  heavy metals ,  and purity tests . 
i got num_num cards but num_num were just dang repeats . 
the color was a very unappetizing greyish green ,  like sliced avocado that s been left out too long . 
it can be dangerous !  this not only didn t keep fleas off my dog ,  it made him sick . 
i purchased a case from amazon ,  but will give it away . 
now foods brand of essential oils seem to have the best deals on the eucalyptus and peppermint oils . 
my daughter loved this phone in the store . 
i backed a pebble watch on kickstarter a long time ago . 
i put it in my hair waited the num_num minutes i wanted it to be really red . 
and did i mention it was pricey very pricey . 
i must say i was very dissapointed with this product . 
i had to toss it but with amazons great policy ,  i wasn t charged for the damaged product . 
here s why .  . no matter what you do ,  this lipstick doesn t stay put . 
bought this for my grandmother s mac mini but it didn t work . 
i got this so i always dont need to wear my turtle beach . 
lego star wars is perhaps one of the best games to be released this year . 
it will last literally num_num years and take up less land fill space when it finally wears out . 
i bought this in soft sable ,  one of the darkest colors . 
at least it did stick to my lashes ,  though . i am have a thing about mascara . 
this is unhealthy and it also affects the taste of the oil . 
i think honestly that s why i was lured in ,  by the way it looks . 
if i accidentally touch the plug ,  the phone does not charge . 
by stimulating the secretion of calcitonin ,  it aids the influx of calcium into bone and promotes optimal bone mineralization . 
how many games have rockstar made ?  i don t know ,  but it seems like it never ends . 
later i can get better tents if needed . 
is light and it looked like it would last . 
i have a trek num_num hard tail mountain bike . 
i didn t think a game in this day and age on the num_num would ever have such terrible performance . 
not worth replacing ,  should of read the reviews . 
at first ,  i thought one or both were going through a  hairball  period and tried their hairball treats . 
looks and feels nice ,  but broke after two weeks . 
i purchased num_extend items this year alone ,  and this was only time i have given num_num stars . 
it takes a lot of effort to get it to move . 
it flashes blue constantly and i find it very distracting . 
it has astronomy ,  greek muses ,  fairy changelings ,  and a friendly pet parrot . 
several seemed to think it was a miracle ,  but not for me . 
i emailed the company asking exactly what kind of plastic is used . 
this is the little brother of the dmt diafold . 
i would have rated them higher ,  if i could have used them as is . 
but most of all they are inferior quality . 
i like to steam my veggies and that destroys the seasoning . 
you re finally able to take control of other pokemon after . 
unfortunately this product didn t leave hair feeling soft ,  and didn t seem to help with untangling . 
the num_extend in spirulina is purely worthless since it is not the needed num_extend like in sardines . 
it hacks away at the cheese and leaves large pieces uncut . 
because that s as low as the rating system goes . 
i put the oxo in our trailer ,  thinking that it might be tolerable for limited use . 
otherwise ,  it s not really worth the time or the money . 
there s no retaining strap ,  but the gun clicks into place ,  requiring a firm draw . 
i am editing my review because i just saw the case and had not tested the item yet . 
generally anybody that wants to play a game ,  just takes the disk to their computer and plays . 
i run the fan off of a small  wall wart  ac adapter . 
put four of these in an electric ruler i own and they wouldn t even power it up . 
whoo hoo !  but then after the first num_num days ,  they were back . 
the seams in the face are also uneven . 
i stoped using this product num_num weeks ago and have been losing eyelashes . 
there were no instructions for how to do it . 
basically the nose does not fit well ,  perhaps i have a larger face . 
but i think i am going back to the waterpik . 
it looks like it shipped from the manufacturer so i don t know who should receive the blame . 
i love dark roast coffees but this one reallywas not what i had hoped for . 
this one i have here .  .  . the squelch has to be turned % full turn before it works . 
i hate to report that it didn t work . 
i have now learned my lesson to never buy a pair of shoes without having first tried them on . 
i ordered this hatchet and received it damaged with chips on the blade along with numerous scratches . 
since the dock does not seem to be for iphone more for like an ipod touch . 
i have never heard of this game but am a big mario fan so i bougt it . 
it works for charging but the data feature is flawed . 
in the past ,  i ve been obsessed with borns ,  but the newer ones haven t been as comfy . 
i loved the style and it appeared that it would be comfortable ,  but it just did not fit right . 
the campaign isn t even a challenge and the online ain t to fun either . 
i m sending back the other num_num that we didn t open . 
not sure if it was this or the machine used with it . 
it reminded me of the sound of a shop vacuum . 
the velcro shoe was a waste; he learned more when putting on his own shoes . 
i added it to a salad and hummus ,  but there s almost zero garlic flavor or smell . 
i had this mirror installed with the purchase of a new specialized sirrus sport bike . 
the sad thing is ,  you wont want it to be longer . 
the wheel doesn t really have anything to attach to and the little box dose not latch . 
every last copy in existence should be burned . do not buy this game !  . 
my always do and it flosses my dogs teeth . 
i cant believe they even sell this stuff . 
oops !  % of the pieces were either crushed or chipped and everything was covered in broken candy dust . 
the problem was clearly in the wiring ,  which is very thin and fragile . 
however ,  at least then you will know you are getting a  real  and good quality product . 
also like everyone else ,  my recorder failed and i spent hours dealing with philips  and getting nowhere  . 
the seller answered my raging email ,  but blamed it on the local carrier . 
also there are different job givers  good old badger  spread across the board as well . 
i ordered this first in xl ,  the size that should fit me according to mcdavid . 
instead ,  opt for naturally sparkling water ,  like pellegrino . 
i have my box ready to go back to amazon . i recieved it quickly ,  and was packaged well . 
i already have a lot of wooden spoons and silicon spatulas . 
hearos have a good size ,  not too long not too short . 
you ll have to put in a lot of effort to get the tires inflated to a high psi . 
we were not at home and the package was left so had no chance to report concealed damage . 
spend more and go with the merkury brand . 
they were almost chalky and did not have a good flavor . 
i appreciate a gp recommending alternative useful medications ,  known to get results without surgery . 
the reason i am only giving a one star to my review is that the picture was deceptive . 
the material on the other hand is not . 
the one i bought was for a little girl . 
never again will i purchase shea butter unless there is a tester available . 
also ,  if you consumed an entire num_num oz . 
glad i got it on sale and only paid $
does not stick well ,  corners peal off and always have bubbles along the edges . 
efforts to discover a solution prompted me to google this device . 
easier to put it in a pan on the stove . 
it had an old lady smell to it . 
what they chose not to read was that the damage occurred due to defects in workmanship . 
then i proceeded to pour a cup of distilled water through it . 
the battling is terribly tedious ,  and the magic system is completely raped of its glory . 
i have an imac num_extend ghz ,  num_extend aluminum ,  mac os x leopard  and a num_num gb ipod classic . 
the towels are very nice and soft only problem is that these are more for washing than wiping things . 
i cleaned the hose out ,  used it again ,  and it jammed again . 
however ,  two weeks later i noticed some white patches in the main walkways . 
don t buy anything large or heavy from amazon as they ship with eagle gl . 
the shoes look great ,  i just wish he could wear them . 
you also get to fight alongside comrades who can hold their own ,  which lends some authenticity to the game . 
next time i ll pass and so should you . 
here are my thoughts on the product : first ,  the num_extend
fast forward to num_num and i ve finally picked up a tekken game . 
most of the skills you can train in aren t very useful . 
i read another review where the same thing happened to another person too . 
this coffee maker brews a mighty good cup of joe . 
buy a quality motorcraft  or similar blade  amazon has the best customer service and took them back . 
but be aware that while your radio probably goes a little below num_extend or whatever ,  this doesn t . 
i guess it s back to aleve unless i can find something else . 
sit back and watch the computer play :  num_extend out ,  num_num and out ,  num_num and out . 
my husband has broken two in the last num_num months . 
secondly ,  the glue job on these  at least on the set i got  was really really sloppy . 
this case was bought for a galaxy num_extend
i feel i have wasted my money on this purchase !  . 
i don t understand the high ratings for this product . 
% of the soy grown in the us is gmo soy . 
i thought i could not go wrong with num_num flavors that i love but i did . 
you get what you get for the price . 
also ,  for skinny jeans ,  it seems odd that they have that extra material at the ankle . 
i think i ll order some from petsmart which has better quality cat cubes . 
a gutsy little almond ,  with a hint of sass and a sweet finish .  .  .  . okay . 
i would try the regular ones first before buying the ultra deep cleansing strips . 
better to try something ladies with caffeine for your cellulite cures along iwth gotokola herbs . 
i have what is called kp on my upper arms after the birth of my third child . 
i bought this while back and just upgrade to vista recently . 
i purchased this product from amazon . com in may num_num for $
if not for the packets puffing ,  i d give the product num_num stars . 
so you always have to fish around for everything . 
i m sure it s even healthier when it s used with food while it s heated . 
the songs are also sung really really fast . 
it comes in a bottle that looks like a milk bottle ,  and that s it . 
i purchased two different colors almost exactly a month ago . 
i tasted the noodles before adding seasoning and it doesn t have any distinguishing taste . 
i have a fat cat ,  and this is not sturdy enough to handle her . 
some of the on screen instructions pop up too quickly and don t give you enough time to read them . 
the xs fit fine around the ribs and i got that size based on other reviews . 
they  had two replacements  all got fried in thunderstorms . 
the flower doesn t fit anywhere else ,  like on her arm ,  where my old school mrs . 
when folded up ,  it is wider than a fishing bag by about num_extend
i thought my cats would love this toy . 
this shirt sized for someone large and in charge or ,  who needs extra room for buffet style dinning . 
does not work . with or with out a case . 
i put this stuff on and would change the bandaid each day ,  after few days nothing . 
it is constantly sounding an alarm and i can t seem to get it to stop . 
waste of money !  these don t stick to my phone and peel off right away . 
i am genuinely surprised by the amount of num_num star votes . 
these are great for cats that don t like combs or brushes .  .  . but the design has to be improved . 
in theory ,  it sounds like a good system to work with ,  but there are highly noticeable flaws with it . 
i purchased this one mainly to use in my car with my ipod . 
it angled to the right  should have tab on bottom  . 
after about two years ,  it gradually ,  and increasingly ,  became harder and harder to clean . 
too complicated and just not fun for the whole family . 
nicely built but certainly not for a large slr as the name implies . 
based on other reviews ,  i was expecting this to be incredible . 
as others have said there are limited choices for the thunderbolt with the extended battery . 
i give it one star as i have not been able to use it . 
i fully expect another week to pass before it all goes away . i contacted kiss my face customer service . 
i ll post photos to show what i am talking about . 
if it was not for the fact that it didn t cost much ,  i would send it back . 
or i get my other fave  file format error  . 
despite the advertised information that this item is made for jawbone era bluetooth headsets ,  they do not fit . 
they don t  fit the ear well ,  and the plastic parts that go on the earphone portions keep falling off . 
i emailed the company and asked why they changed it . 
i have ka stand mixer ,  hand blender ,  food processors large and small ,  emersion blender and attachments for all . 
and no protective plastic cover . item does work as designed .  .  .  . at least the first time i tried it . 
maybe they can turn the plastic into grocery bags . shame on brita for selling faulty kitchen equipment . anthony trendl  .  .  .   . 
i use gallon milk containers as the water reservoir . 
with that in mind ,  you need to consider that when getting a ratzapper . 
the toy is stamped with the year num_extend but it is so similar to the ones from the num_extend
my unit also stopped working after num_num months . 
anything bigger than airsoft will break the plastic holder on any impact other than dead center . 
cheap material and does not fit well ,  i was not impressed at all with this jacket . 
it did ,  however ,  finally decide us on replacing it with one that has a closed handle . 
difficult to crank even when not grinding num_extend
not to mention ,  they were gone within two minutes . go with thec . e . t . 
also a piece of the plastic broke off . 
however ,  she got sick a while back and we took her to our vet . 
if you want to play a good sims game then go buy the sims bustin  out . 
however ,  after just num_num days of light wear ,  the lining of the soles are coming apart . 
need to make try and error adjustments in order to be able to hear both sides . 
this is supposed to be an exfoliator ?  hardly . 
it didn t work for me so i don t recommend it . 
i gave this to my num_num yr old niece and num_num year old nephew . 
just not working the way i hoped ,  is in the way and pops out of kayak easily . 
this is not moisturizing enough . feels heavygets really greasyvery thick ,  almost like a foundation . burns my eyes terribly . 
as someone who struggles to drink enough water ,  i wanted to like this product . 
it would also turn on the weapon as it was concealed . 
my stones are certainly not flat either like some other reviewers mentioned . 
and the pirated version doesn t have securom or install limits which makes it a better version . 
they have been stored just like other dried fruits we buy ,  in a pantry . 
it s a pokemon game ,  but it s a rather bland pokemon game . 
the life of this battery is equal to or less than the life of the original battery . 
if you shave daily ,  do not upgrade to this . 
have bought a lot of things from amazon and never encountered this problem before; maybe things are changing . 
i don t know what to say about this item . 
not sure if it was my dog or the product . 
never made it back on a mosin but it fell apart on a num_extend
will work for now but i would recommend saving $ more and getting tfo s next time . 
this is after following the directions exactly ,  spraying with pam before each waffle . 
disappointing because had they not been broken ,  i believe they would have sounded fine . 
this is a piece of junk and i wish i returned it . 
like most serrated knives ,  sharpening the henkels with a grinder is not recommended ,  this really diminishes the value . 
maybe only the neighbourhood ; the graphics are not bad ,  but very boring . 
this equipment is faulty and linksys refuses to acknowledge the problem . 
this product is ,  at best ,  an engineering prototype . 
graphics are good ,  but not great by any means . 
they still have that weird protein shake taste and i could only taste a hint of cookie dough flavor . 
this time i opened it up a found that the black power cord had pulled off of its connector . 
although i think these are the right size for me ,  the way they are cut makes them baggy looking . 
me and pedobear agree that anise is nice loli . 
because of the address they accused me of using it for commercial purposes . 
i believe products meant for consumption should be well packaged and made as airtight as possible . 
i bought this heating pad but will be returning it due to lack of satisfaction . 
i m contemplating if we should fork out the money to return it . 
i might try to fashion something out of velcro . 
i will bring this company to amazons attention . 
you can t get to the plug in socket to fix without damaging the radio . 
i proceeded to clone the drive under the normal method ,  as opposed the reverse way . 
well ,  i think the printers left something off the box . 
also it accentuated every little line and pore . 
same as the top ,  these pants fit like a num_extend
i can see where users of previous models would be less than pleased by the change . 
make sure you know what works with it . 
we were due for new screen protectors so i grabbed these through vine . 
the factory told me to warm the grips and that they would stretch enough to align the screw holes . 
if you ve got sensative skin ,  stay away from this product !  don t waste your money . 
we had to discard the rest of the product . 
also not an issue with other cheep grinders i ve bought . 
i have had to hand retrieve lures because upon casting it gets caught up on it s self . 
there are so many things wrong with this coffee maker i am not sure where to start . 
this ball is about the size of a tennis ball . 
i will stick to secure from now on . 
too bad because i actually love the other shany cosmetics products that i purchased . 
food allergy sufferers can appreciate it :  soy free chocolate . 
same applies to the other shore lunch meals we tried !  do yourself a favor and leave them alone !  . 
i tried to make this work but its just isn t there . 
nothing but flimsy cardboard shoved inside cheap plastic . 
after two tries ,  she got hers so that it will work . 
after many hours working with this product ,  we have given up . 
if you re willing to splurge a bit ,  i can highly recommend kyocera s num_extend ceramic paring knife . 
i have to agree with most of the other reviews . 
so for num_num cards of the num_num he got essentially num_num cards . 
i thought maybe it was a defective item so i exchanged it . 
people might mistakenly believe the harnesses have been tested for safety . 
i tried the adapters and read all the comments to find a fix but in the end nothing worked . 
i guess she s more long than tall so she looks like a sardine when sitting in this bag . 
our cat took it without much problem ,  but he started running around like crazy . 
bought this for my wife for a bit of spice in her undergarment arsenal . 
i m disappointed i can t get it cheaper but i much prefer having miso i enjoy . 
ended up throwing this away after only a month or so  couldn t return it  . 
they re even a too close fit for me ,  and i wear num_extend or num_extend
i usually really like dessert essence products so i was excited to try it . 
i bought it when it was   .  .  .   and   .  .  .  rebate ,  but i returned it right away . 
at num_extend this lens is very soft ,  it s hard to get a shot that looks like it s in focus . 
not sure why there isn t much charge in it . 
but the starbucks natural fusions ground coffee was a major disappointment . 
i think that if it costs that much it should come with the cable !  !  !  !  . 
i am going to try one more thing to fix the problem ,  new batteries . 
i use to use colorstay eyeliner by revlon ,  but was looking for something better . 
i m a little disappointed because i like the concept and the sight picture . 
this is not a miracle like the other reviews claim . 
i m babying my hair these days !  my hair definitely didn t and doesnt feel babied after using this line . 
sometimes it recognizes peripherals and other times not . 
one of the computers  connecting wirelessly  would continually drop packets . 
i ended up buying a regular manual unit and find that i get far better accurate results . 
this review is about the door attachment ,  not the bands . 
i have finally given up .  .  . this device isn t for me . 
i bought this with a groupon from a restaurant supply store . 
the cable did not work with my legacy hp laserjet num_extend in a windows num_num new installation . 
if it was for the lotion alone ,  i probably would have rated it a num_extend everhard ,  october num_extend
tools are rusting and it comes in a very cheap box . 
some of the error screens have grammatical errors . 
i was so frustrated . i told my husband i d had it . 
the only reason i gave it a star at all was because of amazon s shipping speed . 
the trouble shooting instructions in the manual did not cover any remedy for this condition . 
first mix them together and heat it to gentle boil and then add to the cooked chicken and veggies . 
especially the part where you insert for num_extend minutes and be perfectly still . 
also ,  the goo seemed to shrink some ,  so i applied it again after the first application dried . 
while i thought the concept of tuna jerky sounded like a good idea ,  in reality these fell short . 
i have really dry and oily  combination  skin . 
my twitch ii is the grey metal version . 
it is essentially a hollow point pellet with a copper bb in the  hollow  portion . 
the battlefield series has more realistic movement as does call of duty num_extend
but i am not going to buy it . 
i was thinking it would change my life based on some reviews . 
but my biggest complaint was that it is not organic . 
as explained in the manual ,  it merely indicates whether the heating element is on . 
shipping was prompt and the product arrived in excellent condition . 
the gargles taste pretty good ,  but they seemed pretty weak from a saltiness perspective . 
sounded good enough in the few areas i could get reception . 
i would definitely not repurchase in the future . 
i bought these chips to vary the offerings i provided my clients . 
and when she pulled it off ,  my head instantaneously felt better . 
prefer a moccasin that snugly wraps around my foot with laces or a boat shoe . 
i bought this case because it was cheap ,  slim and i liked the color . 
but i find it leaks when i try to use it covering my fingers with nail polish remover . 
it has a hard time with frozen fruit ,  so don t try the ice . 
when finished my thumbs were bleeding and my hands were sore . 
we have never been able to tell if this thermometer is actually reading temperature fluctuations or not . 
so i decided to pick one out and give it a try . 
the other two are still working ,  but i have noticed that they only protect against bigger fluctuations in power . 
even my opthamologist and his staff had no idea this tool existed for soft lenses . 
they were properly sized ,  requiring only some minor trimming to fit my num_extend shoes . 
if i wanted to be bored i would play mist or halo ,  or some other computer game . 
it s not really very stretchy at all ,  in my opinion . 
in this aspect ,  this is almost like the real thing ,  haha . 
i was extremely disappointed ,  as i love csi . 
then after you use it once and enter all the height ,  age etc . 
dietary fiber is sugar but digests very slow so can be ignored mostly . 
the sweet chili flavor was not for my taste . 
one was off to the side so i had to send them back . 
the second game had a nice narrative ,  but fell far short from the original . 
levels like head shot or weapons complex just make me want to drill a hole in my game . 
i still have num_num bottles of it but it was completely useless . 
there is no way it will fit any of those dogs . 
inspect other companies products where the coupler attaces to the motor . i actually looked at a waring pro . 
we ve always used a fluffy wash cloth to wash our vehicles ,  but i figure there must be something better . 
i learned the hard way that this product is a major rip off !  . 
i am pressing out pie dough for miniature pies and the dough is not as cold as recommended . 
this may be good for a very petit person . 
i liked this scent when it was in a different product . 
all those other reviewers who said that this dish rack is too small for actual dishes are correct . 
these glasses are very nice ,  seem sturdy and you get a lot for your money . 
although griot s has some good products ,  ,  ,  , and some not so good ,  ,  , this one is miserable . 
this expansion pack  ep  was a complete wast of my time ,  and money . 
it can take up to two minutes before it locks compared to a tilt . 
this bar is really bad at removing deep grimy working on the car dirt ,  my definition of deep cleaning . 
she is not an aggressive chewer at all ,  her toys last a loooonnnngggg time . 
i was pretty happy with my vacu vin vacuum instant marinater at first . 
too bad ,  because i was curious to see if it is as good as my nova pro . 
look elsewhere for good num_extend protection and ease of use . 
the shirt s quality was very nice ,  but it was incredibly long . 
i m num_extend and the length is about what i expected . 
there s tons of cream on the bottom that the pump simply can t reach . 
until now this has made very good coffee ,  but will not purchase again . 
i run marathons and i m samll everywhere but my boobs and i need support . 
i ve done those things ,  it still will not play an entire song . 
of course amazon is the best !  and i had no problem returning this one . 
sure ,  i ll win a bunny race num_num times in a row to get this one inventor . 
i m usually optimistic in my reviews of things but this was so cheap . 
this may be helpful even for those with neuropathy caused by diabetes . 
this film is not cut to the size that it need to be . 
what is wrong with this set ?  of course ,  it is too late to return it . 
i hate it when sellers use a stock photo unlike the item . 
my fault for not asking for a refund on time . 
the hottest setting is just warm to me . 
i tried reapplying daily which got me to about num_num days before i had to redo my nails . 
i picked up a new one in the lxe model . 
i m disappointed in monster cable . stay away from this device . 
like the other reviewer ,  my garden is still too early for tomatoes . 
i m not sure this could have been made out of a cheaper plastic . 
i end up having to push it back in every couple minutes ,  especially if i m moving around at all . 
argh ! there is fun to be had with this game . 
for some reason they do not absorb at all and you are left with major puddles beneath the pads . 
i ve read rumors that cetaphil contains sls which is known to irritate some people s skin . 
once the job is finished the grip is extremely beautiful . 
i thought this coffee maker was the answer when i first bought it . 
at first blush ,  this actually tastes a little like saltwater . 
i needed a blade that left hair longer . 
num_num minutes after taking a few sips my tongue was still burning from the spices ,  not the heat . 
within num_num minutes my boston terrier had removed the squeaker and basically destroyed the whole thing . 
this hat was a huge disappointment ,  ditto to all the negative reviews . 
if you have a favorite hard candy ,  just use that  jelly ranchers ,  lollypops ,  etc  . 
now it is not played with at all . 
inside of the battery compartment was very dirty and dinged up . 
if i lose a competition ,  there is no retry button . 
my $ rule :  $ a pound or less ,  because i m frugal . 
i recommend doterra ,  they are more expensive but worth it . 
i cannot take the acid of vit c ,  thus had also ordered ester c ,  non acidic . 
stick to the other rockstar hits and avoid this bomb . 
fable ii promised alot and delivered a game that is seriously lacking many qualities . 
everytime i try to use it it says no microphone found and to please add one . 
not so much ideal . if you don t mind the aftertaste ,  it s pretty reasonable cereal . 
that makes it tempting to use this in other than the precise circumstances it requires . 
unfortunately ,  like most things these days ,  the gloves are made overseas in a sweat shop ,  in this case pakistan . 
i can t complain ,  this was a cheap case . 
i cannot recommend this unless you like old tasting puffs . 
i gave it to my granddaugter for christmas with a gift certificate . 
anyway ,  before i purchased it i had read the bad reviews and decided to take a chance . 
i wondered if anyone actually worked there ! these products are cheap for a reason . 
guess the kids will learn to pick up their toys now . 
on top of all that i m not a ranting gamecube fanboy either . 
after the first piece ,  i decided that i don t like this brand at all . 
i bought this vacuum because of the great reviews on amazon . 
i changed this from num_num stars to num_num stars . 
searched online for solutions ,  tried everything i could and nothing works . 
i m not sure where they get that information from ,  but i tried this way first and no improvement . 
i never got any such warning ,  nor have a i used thise thermometer heavily . 
i consider it a complete outrage that panasonic is not fixing this for free regardless of warranty status . 
need to save at trader joe s instead of amazon prices . 
i purchased this antenna and i didn t get any hdtv signals num_extend miles away from antenna  . 
the case is ok but the screen needs to be protected . 
i m going to try it ,  but if it doesn t work ,  i ll be returning it . 
it would be more of a hassle to return it and i love the way it looks . 
change the color ,  put a symbol on it ,  make it flash ,  something . 
sent them back and ordered hogue handall which helps immensely with felt recoil . 
dropped it in the drive way and it was demolished when my roommate ran over it . 
i would love to say this works but i would be telling a lie . 
it becomes even more repetitive than crazy taxi ever did . 
i knew that there was a chance he wouldn t like them ,  but i think these are badly constructed . 
blue num_num may not cause cancer ,  but confirmatory studies should be conducted . 
since day num_extend i ve had but problems with it . 
i have ,  for years ,  bought the xl kong dog toy . 
i tried it on my face but couldn t stand the smell !  . 
it is too much ,  and stings the eyes . 
in fact prior to home arcades all of the games used joysticks . 
these didn t seem to really fit my foot properly .  .  . the arch support seemed too long . 
has too much override; where you hear the same station on adjacent frequencies . 
now you build little wings of num_num or so that do your bidding . 
it simply isn t worth the risk and there are other solutions . 
the hinge holding the num_num sides together ,  extremely hard . 
i bought these for my husband who was taking them and complaining that he did not like them . 
the next day i picked up the ball and noticed black marks on it . 
my previous dryer was great but it just stopped working after many year . 
i had to toss the water container and just use it as a normal water bowl . 
nonetheless ,  the big problem with mafia is that the gameplay is tedious and at some points down right boring . 
these are my least favorite of the loma linda products . 
the font !  what is wrong with computer game programmers nowadays . 
don t know why ,  but i ve learned to trust his opinion . 
that is not the quality i was expecting ,  especially from melissa and doug . 
there is almost no bass in these earphones . 
the dress is not as pink as in the picture ,  rather a dull color . 
it tends to give me a head ache i would not recommend indoors you will probably die . 
sorry to say that both have been major disappointments for my family . 
you can t even travel to fight people in jhoto and kanto . 
i purchased two pair of these pants and was extremely disappointed that they were so small . 
i had this product for a few years now ,  and have only used it a dozen times or so . 
probaby the biggest scam of the modern era . 
this one was so close .  . but they should ve made it more  sweet  and less  musky  .  .  :   . 
i probably would give it to the trash . 
i know that not every review is perfect . 
the description says it supports more than what she weighs but it seems a little flimsy . 
it is so hard to put on that i didnt even put it on . 
ordered num_num of these items from num_num different places all through amazon . 
the provider sent me a num_num not the num_num i paid for . 
if you switch to  manual  you can choose from some preset whitebal adjustments  e . g . 
so obviously ,  i am not happy with this product . 
shadows and particles may have increased ,  but characters  and equipment  have not . 
i have my air pump under an upside down plant pot and on top of a num_num gallon bucket . 
i have read the manual and have not misused this machine at all; it really is that bad . 
i found it irritating and couldn t wait to shampoo it out and off my scalp . 
i put some on his mouth and when he licks it he shakes his head and turns away . 
i used this phone case for maybe num_num hours . 
i can leave my phone in the tractor and walk at least num_num feet away and it still connects . 
much like the other reviewers ,  i had a lot of difficulty to get this thing to work . 
samsung s stylus although more expensive without pen is an excellent stylus for the money and the shiping cost . 
actually purchased this at wallyworld because my num_extend one crapped out . 
you feel like it s the same one in the whole game . 
and i m not able to shoot any people that are standing close to me . 
haven t noticed any dramatic changes ,  but have only used this product twice a week in about num_extend as suggested . 
it s too messy and inconvenient to deal with problems . 
i tried to record it over and over ,  close to the mic ,  far away ,  soft voice ,  loud . 
so i should send it back to get it fixed right ? wrong . 
it stinks !  ! there is really only one reason that i will probably keep this phone . 
i loved the glossiness ,  but it just didn t work with what i wanted . 
i was looking for an affordable ,  gentle cleanser which cleanse well . 
much more expensive; but for the weight and size it offers much more capability . 
the moon dough with other accessories is fine . 
but it was given to me with a water damaged battery . 
i think that this was an alright game . 
my story is repeated over and over by other women who wasted money on this product . 
my cats just don t give a care at all for light up balls . 
that speaks volumes  my kids will eat anything left around  . 
i was quite surprised when they were some of the worst blades that i ve ever used . 
i bought this just because it was cheap with free shipping . 
big time fail !  it shouldn t cost this much for weak coffee . 
our dishes are always streaked with a cloudy white film ,  and our glasses are all cloudy . 
i wish i had not bought so many cases ,  as here they sit . 
doesn t hold them for more than a minute ,  but it feels good . 
  ait is a num_extend amco enameled aluminum lemon squeezer   learned my lesson about paying for stuff that is cheap . 
i m glad i tried it out ,  but no thanks . 
i never thought i would write a review about bannana jacks but these are extremely poor quality . 
that s an old tech support trick to get you off the phone . 
this has nothing to do with the quality of your dishwasher . 
disappointed in this purchase for our son s num_extend birthday . 
now imagine if that special code didn t exist where you can kill people in just one or two shots . 
i am one of the few who purchased this and imediately got my money back . 
after installing and powering on i get a message that the battery is unsupported . 
this protein powder is inedible as far as i am concerned . very unpleasant to drink anything made with this product . 
the edge is absolutely horrible; it s too high . 
they are cheaply made and many came with deforms . 
then when i get to the foot ,  i have to cram it in there even harder . 
the product says a twist because of carbonation . 
after practicing your  draw  a little you ll learn to easily activate the button and quickly acquire the target . 
there was good reason to add the second woofer to the earphone . 
however ,  we really want and need them most when it s hottest outside . 
i may have gotten a bad batch ,  but my gut feeling is this is old product . 
but considering this game is pretty recent , it s downright inexcusable . 
such a great idea but doesn t work for larger sizes . the fit is odd and uncomfortable . 
there are three buttons atop the sticks head ,  they re very easy to hit ,  in fact ,  too easy to hit . 
today itself i am returning it to amazon . 
every cook has those tools that they love but if you are just getting into this then don t bother . 
did they even bother capturing player motion at all ?  there is a horrible lack of replay camera angles . 
purchased for a group of boys in a boarding school . 
there was supposed to be a zippered seal ,  but the sliding mechanism was missing . 
will charge ipad very very slowly if screen is off . 
so they just sit on top of the unit collecting dirt . 
this did not come to my door in this vibrant pretty purple . 
there is no bitterness and it truly takes very little to sweeten . 
stealing anyone ?  i find more time stealing items than i think is necessary for the gameplay . 
immediately explained why an exchange was not an option  as i wanted  ,  gave me one option and offered refund . 
the same cheese sauce that they use in the restaurants and put on burritos and nachos . 
the feel of the nylon was rough and uncomfortable . 
it s relatively consistent and doesn t sputter too much  unless you tilt the hose forward  . 
there is no tone control ,  so we are stuck with it . 
meaning zico is the same as coco cola ,  the same as the competition without fair trade num_extend
i bought these strings after buying some elixir strings for my acoustic ,  which i was pretty happy with . 
coffee automatic burr mill grinder to replace this one . 
stay away from these if you are serious about your training . 
i have newly relaxed  texlaxed  arm pit length hair . 
crash collects berries throughout the game  mario collects coins ,  sonic collects rings  . 
this is not worth the money you spend for it . 
just used these once and they do not have the same issue . 
i ve since replaced my plastic drinkwell platinum with pioneer pet raindrop fountain to alleviate the problem . 
i could take it or leave it; mostly leave it . 
these shoes are adorable ,  i loved them when i got them . 
this toy is well made but did not appeal to my dog . 
while it is about double the price ,  it is the game you know and love . 
it ripped a little bit on the inside in no time at all . 
then you re expected to place the soaking wet piece of plastic on your screen . 
but the sides started falling off and snapped once when i took it off my phone . 
i love reed s ginger chews and i had hoped these were as tasty . 
after that ,  you peel off in the opposite direction of hair growth . 
i m sure it s good ,  but the num_extend offers much more features and costs about $
the markings on the battery differ in subtle ways ,  and in places the writing has started to wear off . 
unfortunately ,  it was very expensive and my num_extend year old doesn t even like this toy . 
the amount of iron was so much higher than the infant formula ,  it constipated him badly . 
dont know why it has so many num_extend stars . 
i am glad i only bought the small size . 
the pin numbers are correct but physical size is larger than my connection . 
its the difference between being able to jump over an oncoming car ,  or being nailed to the ground . 
i will never ever wear neither one of the pair of jeans i purchased . 
i gave it away to someone who just loves it !  lol to each his own !  . 
maybe their company is entirely staffed by early num_extend marathon runners and their sizing is a bit skewed . 
the reason i bought this rice cooker was because of the great features it had . 
i wish i d just put the money i spent on this one toward a better one . 
it probably won t arrive until february !  it s going to take num_num months for delivery !  just a warning !  . 
this product smells wonderful ,  but it doesn t detangle ,  nor does it make your hair soft and manageable . 
when that failed  must be me  the sony looked like a great choice . 
the biggest problem i had with smackdown vs . 
the stretchy straps also make them more comfortable to wear . 
i have since bought the icy hot patches to use for my upper arm discomfort . 
i thought the color was ok but i wouldn t buy again . 
reminds me of listening to high end stereo systems in the num_extend num_extend may be even better . 
and then they agree to send you a refurbished unit for replacement . 
filled it again   i really wanted it to work  and put it out . 
i never felt clean using this because it doesn t lather . 
she decorates cakes and said more of a headache than they are worth . 
i did not receive the right flavor and shipping seemed to take very long . 
i usually can get through a whole bag of snacks during a workday . 
the plastic does not appear to me to be a high heat engineering plastic . 
if i have to throw it away ,  i ll throw away as little $ as possible ,  thank you . 
too bad i bought num_num bottles of this stuff . 
after using it for one day ,  i decide to return num_extend
i had to put plenty of glue on their butts to stick them down . 
back piece of phone along with battery and charger were also loose in box . 
by the time i noticed ,  the popcorn had burned and seriously scorched the container . 
playing sid meier s civilization iii complete seemed to be a cool game from the outset . 
it did not matter if i used just a little ,  or added more . 
from the picture ,  you would think you re getting quite a bit . 
i have no problem with cursing if it serves a purpose and creates the right emotion . 
luckily this wiped off but i don t like the fact that its rubbing against the num_extend
bosch has always been my wiper blade choice ,  until now . 
i returned the shoes as per enclosed instructions from shoeline . 
then i bought the top fin num_extend gallon tank ,  but the output was too strong . 
i moved from a ranch to a condo ,  and needed to start over with my approach to vegetable gardening . 
stuff will somehow  roll  down a perfectly flat area of land . 
i have fine ,  straight hair down to my armpits . 
as i was off buying a battery for the remote ,  the battery cover went missing . 
and it s good only for killing a laundry scent or spray in the bathroom to kill nasty smelling bacterias . 
they all say the same thing . given the design of this ,  i can t imagine how anyone s plastic lid didn t melt . 
i have recently come back to it ,  and am disappointed at how flimsy the filters now are . 
it s inconvenient to have to have both hands free . 
i tried to hold my skin taut but it still hurt when i tugged on the mask . 
i think another review said you had to siphon the thing first . 
it is too small ,  i didn t feel like sending it back . 
received card ,  installed per instructions and computer would not recognize the card at all . 
the cookies are individually wrapped  ,  which is convenient . 
i have ajabra journeyand had to fly out of state to help my daughter move back home . 
if you like weak spice tea then you may like this one . 
the first one i bought already showing signs of falling apart . 
this time ,  the printer will only prints half pictures . 
i like cinnamon in general ,  but this taste is kind of too funky . 
yet it will receive the major am stations so long as they are moderate in strength or better . 
i made a mistake and now have to eat it . 
twice a month the server lost its programming . 
i ve spent num_num hours trying to get this unit right but i give up !  . 
it tastes like you re drinking something with vitamins in it and that isn t the best thing . 
it s my own fault for not noting that this has added fragrance before purchasing it . 
the only way to use this is to not use the arm brace . 
the cookie continued to fall apart after one bite . 
no sense . i will not order from this company again . 
the volume control degraded the sound quality significantly . 
if you like the pose in the picture you will be fine ,  but don t count on much more . 
first of all ,  this product claims to be  black cherry  flavor . 
the lawyer hides just as you are about to move a military unit to kill him . 
no to this junk; it s as bad as spraying your pet with raid . 
the stays that are supposed to help it not roll and stay put are extremely flimsy . 
i have a scar between my eyes on the bridge of my nose . 
it is not shiny and it is very rough . 
it s exactly like rainbow six escept outdoors and with less soldiers and less choice of equipment . 
i bought this product based on many reviews that it really does work . 
been going around in circles trying to get this to work with no luck . 
yes ,  he puts it on his head for num_num second as a helmet ,  and that is about it . 
my num_num months girl didn t draw its once . 
so we continue to let him explore with my real dslr under very close supervision . 
after getting used to good readings ,  it s a frustrating design problem . 
it wasn t slimy or it didn t stink nearly that much . 
you always have to clean this machine immediately after using it ,  because you cannot immerse it into water . 
you d be able to put your iphone and a small set of keys in there probably . 
which is a real pisser considering everyone wants their money ,  including me . 
they don t make your mouth sing with chocolatey snappy joy . 
battery test lights quit working after after two or three times using it . don t waste your $
a faint smell stays even after you wash your hands ,  so keep that in mind too . 
i was so hoping that this would work because i ve never had any other treatments before . 
and don t even think of using this with a tablet . 
it is not rugged and very thin material . 
its amazing how seagate has yet to be suedfor issuing so many dead drives . 
this unit is hdmi ready but only through the rca jacks which lowers the resolution on your tv set . 
you only get about one full body coverage with this can . 
you can brew better green tea from green tea bags at home . 
the  tropical paradise  motif is interesting for a while ,  but it quickly becomes tiresome . 
plus they re labeled lead and phylate free ,  and since md doesn t label theirs i assume they aren t . 
just lemon smell light that means its not citrus smell citrus smell light orange smell if i m not wrong . 
to avoid a potential emergency visit to the vet ,  i took the toy away . 
then i mentioned this one ,  which has nearly the same space at much lower price . 
the cord was over num_num feet and ,  at least for me ,  the perfect size . 
try the lexar num_extend sd card from amazon . 
well i went to scoop some brown sugar and the handle started bending . 
after another num_num or num_num months ,  this one did |exactly the same thing . 
these crayons have an adjustable height to move up the crayon once it s been used . 
i got these to use on my leather clothes and car seat . 
what a waste of money !  i would never buy anything from terk anymore . 
they go up maybe num_num feet in elevation at a distance of probably num_num feet . 
i believe that the actual ear pieces are too small . 
i m sorry to say it was a lot better ,  and this bar was the texture of cardboard . 
if you read the ingredients list ,  you will also find num_num other sugars :  maltodextrin and fructose . 
i installed the software and it printed at first and then sometimes very slowly ,  and often required rebooting . 
num_extend has a horrible soundtrack too num_extend is the best  . 
my left headphone dropped it s volume level about %
for convenience and fast brewing i give this two stars ,  but there s where the good news ends . 
maybelline lash stiletto mascara did not give me particularly long ,  vibrant lashes . 
in my case ,  prevented the fan from fitting snugly in the window . 
and on the contrary ,  i now think i was too generous when i wrote the last review . 
it is totally unusable ,  as i don t want it near my face or in my hand . 
he loves cars and we have several other noisy toys that he likes to play with . 
either the first or second time i used it ,  it became loose . 
these aren t really stylish or in great colors ,  but the material does work great on touch screens . 
this is usually in the later half of the game . 
then this is probably going to be right up your alley . 
but the next time i turned my computer on ,  the speakers where fine . 
the case its self fits like a glove . 
the mint creme  which is actually closer to shortening than cream  is a fairly thin layer . 
they gave us our money back ,  even after all that time had passed . 
i m actually online to buy another yogourmet so i can make large batches of goat and cow yogurts simultaneously . 
fortunately ,  this is one of their few misses . 
if you are a b or less this might be all you need . 
my fiance got sick because of this food supplement . 
chondroitin and glucoseamine are not meant for those with shellfish allergies . australian dream ointment seemed to be the only alternative . 
i adjusted it back ,  tightened the optic back down and began shooting again . 
i like the smell and flavor of the beans . 
the ball itself is sturdy and won t be destroyed or chewed . 
not sure why it s in products designed to moisturize !  propylene glycol . 
the strategy that is involved basically is parrying with square and retaliating in a drunken mashing way . 
but i just wanted to let you all know . 
num_num out of num_num people i ve heard buying this ,  me included ,  had huge problems with it . 
this oil is cut real bad with some kind of waxy substance ,  and who knows what . 
i have num_num dogs and not one of them have anything to do with this kong toy . 
the one thing i like ?  the spf for protection from the sun . 
this is my second sony remote of this type . 
booooo !  !  !  ! now i am wondering if coastal scents gave out incentives for these reviews because this product is definitely inferior . 
these gmos have not been subjected to independent ,  long term ,  peer reviewed studies to prove that they are safe . 
there is no indication of when it s heated up . 
i bought these for a trip to yellowstone . 
this was so terrible i spit it out . 
i need to sharpen it after every use . 
the quality of the hair is good .  .  . its just not made well . 
i have never purchased a worse one that this . 
i lost the registration card so unfortunately this toy is just going in the trash . 
huh ?  what on earth ?  had some cookies on this ,  and it just started spewing smoke . 
for num_num months i loved this easy to use opener . 
other than that there s not much reason to play this game . 
as soon as we brought out her old litter ,  she used it right way . 
another great looking piece of junk from salton . 
i followed the instructions and provided a heavy application ,  especially around  and in  the two holes . 
but ,  i hate cheating to win a game . 
although i ve called him back twice and left messages on his voicemail ,  i haven t heard from him since . 
they kind of wedgie me in the butt ,  they fit kind of awkward . 
not all mixers require the adapter to hold the bowl . 
and then they catch ,  making that fan not work  there are num_extend
works great in intervals though ,  too bad those intervals are minutes . 
but ,  i have yet to find any pantyhose made for larger women . 
it s too heavy and cumbersome . perhaps that s partly because it does it s job too well . 
totally the most awful shopping experience fm amazon . 
if people are not warming this ,  then they have no idea what other unknown substances are added to this . 
as it stands ,  they only replace it if it get scratched . otherwise ,  don t get near these people . 
i dont even know why people still buy this crap . 
he ll also take the lead in the tournament . 
i had been looking for larger sized sunglasses ,  like all the female stars seem to have . 
doesn t chop through thick areas of hair very fast . 
a few weeks after that ,  and i can t get a connection at all . 
i would recommend buying one more set of toys with people included in it . 
you can purchase bubble bandit for $ and it s a superior product anyway . 
it took a couple of weeks of treatments and a hair cut to get it mostly back to normal . 
i understand how gravity works but apparently this device doesn t . 
i d get a doctor s help on such things . 
i get that they arent the seller ,  but as an amazon customer this upset . 
since i have been in contact with them num_num weeks ago . 
as i previously said ,  the bass starts out decent and then fades away into nothingness . 
for like $ think i got it for more at best buy  ,  it s a waste of money . 
maybe a great idea in the winter months ,  but in summertime it s completely silly . 
so normal coffee ,  whether it irritates you or not ,  isn t all that acidic . 
i was running the game on an older pc that was capable of running bethesda softworks  oblivion . 
i used this several times but it didn t prevent fogging on my goggles . 
no way to really clean it completely so it is not real safe to use . 
i love pink .  .  . and it was just what i was looking for .  .  . however it broke very quickly . 
these are nothing like the ones in the bigger tubs . 
i heard many raves about this product and i wanted to try it . 
i must admit ,  i like to be very aware about what kind of food i am eating . 
basically this means the game isn t even a full game . 
too light to use; you need a stylus that is a bit heavier . 
i find it to be bitter and have an unpleasant taste . 
i called kitchenaid about it and was given some nonesense about  planned wearing  to protect other components . 
it has been great as far as getting my son to participate and interact with us . 
 ow ,  ow ,  ow ,  ow !  !  !  !  get them off me . 
the disgustingly weak plot was made tolerable only by the cg movies . 
spend a little more money on another option this one stopped working in num_num days . 
this one doesn t appear to be a threat for scratches ,  either . 
unfortunitly most things that are hyped don t live up to it as is the case with deus ex num_extend
beware ,  i suspect this is a sanyo s qulity control problem . 
but in the end ,  you get what you pay for . 
in fact it was painfully frustrating and boring . 
even buying new pads and adding fresh batteries did not help . 
and this stuff ain t makin  it happen either . this stuff doesn t work for us . 
all that loving  gently ,  no throwing around  and one of its legs fell out of place within a week . 
heavy  ,  and there still isn t a protection for the front . 
folks ,  if you don t glean anything else from this review ,  know this :  vitamin num_extend is cholecalciferol . 
fiber one honey nut is by far a superior cereal all around . 
if you are debating between a pocket pc and a palm the pocket pc wins hands down . 
not a big deal but a little annoying . 
plus the base can be a bit slippery ,  and that scares her . 
for about twenty years ,  final fantasy has never let me down . 
it also does not last on your face . 
it would have been great if amazon actually ever sent it . 
 i subscribe to amazon premium dry dog foods ,  which is both a great bargain and convenience  . 
i suspect that leaving this on even longer ,  num_num to num_num minutes ,  may have made a more noticeable difference . 
they do not feel cushiony at all ,  and my feet hurt all day . 
the only thing is ,  most of them require you to go out of your way for them . 
if you have higher than average arches ,  do not buy this product . 
think of this as the chevy chevette of palms . 
the battery life also shortens significantly during the num_num year warranty with moderate use . 
in the middle of unwrapping all the toys onxmas .  .  . we lost the antenna part that goes on top . 
and other reviewers have commented that the taste has changed . 
five stars for hk s service ,  shipping ,  and tracking . 
i liked the natural blush color that appeared when i applied this product . 
got here week later then my whole order . 
but with the sluggy gameplay and the continual crashes ,  it becomes very tiring very quickly . 
the earrings were not sterling silver .  .  . peeling and one broke . 
i had seen them plenty here on amazon and in the store and i was very curious about them . 
num_num of num_num plates were broken into tiny pieces . 
my hair became extremely frizzy after using this num_extend
it will blow away in a strong storm . 
when there is an object right in front of you ,  your ship blocks your vision ,  making you shoot blindly . 
after the many wonderful reviews for this monitor ,  i was very disappointed that i couldn t get it to work . 
small thin knive but metal is sub par . 
this problem happened on both of my computers at home which use xp pro . 
it has a regular head with a screen for shaving close ,  and two epilator heads . 
the soundtrack is awful and doesn t go with the game at all . 
it is not very clear how you do that because the site employs mystery meat navigation . 
i find the thing to be really messy to clean . 
i ended up doing a half enfagrow ,  half whole milk mix just to get him  going  again . 
i firmly believe a game should be fully functional out of the box . 
i am assuming there was a bug in the software ,  so i count that as a third demerit . 
this was the first ff game that i didn t play through a second time . 
i know fabric will relax when worn ,  so we ll see ,  but right now i m not thrilled . 
i purchased another one locally for a previous phone that was real rubber and much thicker than this one . 
it would be real nice to spend this kind of money for some enjoyment and get grief instead . 
i ve played bang about a dozen times over the years  when forced to by my gaming group  . 
what atelier has going for it is the elemental combination and synthesis system . 
i wish the stethoscope in this toy was easier to use . 
the lo and high settings dispersed the exact same amount of air . 
i loved the solano ,  but i wanted to see if a significantly less expensive dryer would work as well . 
it was a great product with none of the issues i am mentioning for the capresso one . 
my former supplier provided very large ,  thick ears that my dogs greatly enjoyed . 
the package i received did not have a seal on the inside of the lid . 
i waited a while to see if my opinion of this bra would improve . 
maybe a soft in lay of some type i used some num_extend electrical tape . 
also ,  one placed on the phone ,  they do not protect the phone . 
i m really amazed how other reviews have a positive opinion on this product . 
in a city populated with buildings that have been shamelessly copied and pasted everywhere . 
the dogs were fine all day on christmas and have been fine since . 
after num_num minutes in chat session the support analyst stopped responding to any of my chat notes . 
the other unit in the household tried this and it did not prevent the flu at all . 
i used half that amount and it was plenty . 
it smells strongly of good old fashioned regular sunscreen ,  and feels like good old fashioned regular sunscreen . 
i m not a fan of fps games where the camera is only from the characters eye for num_num reasons . 
i never thought the koss sounded particularly good ,  but these are much worse . 
i returned it because i knew that piece would be broken in no time . 
brown water ,  really ?  this thing just will not work for me . 
so i receive these ,  prepare as instructed ,  and make a waffle . 
too bad ,  because it s the exact toy many many littles are ready for . 
i live in los angeles and find that the none of the preset frequencies work well . 
way over priced for a product that lacks the performance of the real deal . 
my son enjoyed this the first time he used it . 
i had seen the kiosk at the mall and i thought this might be a promising product . 
i ordered a replacement charger and it took over num_num months to receive it . 
because this is an older device ,  most operating systems do not support it . 
i was hoping to get a lighter belt to wear under more conforming clothing . 
i had to set dishes on the counter to scrub them which is cumbersome and takes way too long . 
i am also disappointed that this didn t work out like i wanted it to . 
finally i tried turning one end around and it snapped . 
the base is also not wide enough for my feet so it feels strange to walk in them . 
it may work for some but it did not work for me and my num_extend
none of us would have eaten the whole bar . one more comment :  the product contains crushed peanuts . 
basically ,  if you re older than num_extend this game will be too childish for your liking . 
so i had to start all the way at the beginning again . 
we generally enjoy the helper meals ,  this one is awful . 
i ordered form the oem shop a num_extend
after about three months ,  the pump no longer could provide my bubble bar and treasure chest with enough air . 
the product looked unfinished and had a couple of gouges in it . 
sometimes while on mute it ll beep every num_num secs . 
i thought that melting it would make it much smoother to add the oils and essenses s . 
just rewire it and it will work fine . 
installed easily under xp pro and worked fine for num_num months . 
yes it is cheap ,  which means it was cheaply made . 
i have yet to use any moisturizer because my skin hasn t been dry . 
most pop music sound much punchier with a boost of bass eq centered around num_extend or so . 
these are cheaply made shoes ,  with no size markings anywhere except the outside of their box . 
i had trouble with the earbuds falling out ,  so i used them without the silicon . 
the first router completely failed ,  had lasted about num_num years so i thought it had a good run . 
to me the chocolate is not sweet and overall very disappointing as it made them taste musty to me . 
get the capsules from thiscompany if you can . 
not a game to play and take turns . 
often times ,  it also ends up running around the sides of the pads . 
i was hesitating from reordering this one again cause i wanted one that i could voice text etc . 
this is where the pro s about this crate end . 
very simply ,  this is a cheaply made product with very fragile plastic threads . 
but i didn t really notice a materially better out come than just using a little extra elbow grease . 
i expect something labeled  apple  to at least remind me of apple when i drink it . 
i did not find that to be true . 
within two months ,  three have failed :  a num_extend num_extend and a num_extend
i don t think he likes the texture of the granola because it is a little sharp . 
well .  .  . you have to be careful with this purchase . 
it has an odd texture ,  in my opinion . 
only for num_num ac chargingoverall ,  if you re getting these for $ including shipping ,  you re getting a good deal . 
i have two main problems with this toy . 
it is a functional ,  basic case ,  and it works ,  but ,  be aware that it is also cheaply made . 
i have the cuisinart num_extend skillet that i use lots of the time and love . 
i was very careful to follow the directions completely . 
the boat was either in the water or in winter storage in the marina . 
it actually takes longer for us to pack it up  or to set it up  than to play it . 
while the flavor isn t unpleasant ,  the texture leaves a lot to be desired . 
amazon should be ambarrased to fulfill this item for the seller . 
i know it is stupid to try to have num_num wives in the same village but why not num_extend
but the reason we returned the item was because the top key didn t work immediately . 
this is my last attempt to try a stevia based sweetener . 
everything was just one big mess and i would never recommend this to anybody . 
but ,  i like that part ,  it looks authentic . 
who d of thought this would be an issue ?  not me . 
many of the other comments talk about the proper ,  or large sizing of this set . 
i have a smallish head and it is tight . 
parts not very refined and opening and closing is very rough . 
you can soak it ,  but then it s hard to get it dry . 
i needed a wired router and actually don t know what this is for ,  although i looked it up . 
looked briefly at the manual and realized programming it actually wouldn t be that hard . 
iomega disks have to be the worst form of storage media ever created . 
i ordered the motorola num_extend as a replacement . 
the batteries today just cannot power such a powerful phone . 
bought a medium because medium shirts is what i wear for everything . 
the color is great but that s about it . 
large reflective areas and even a little noticeable in the num_extend
i wish it were a little larger ,  it gets hot in georgia . 
even a six cup batch is too cool to enjoy . 
if you have any inkling you might not like the shaver . 
i didn t look like a better version of myself at all . 
worked like it was supposed to but the plastic makes the images less crisp and gets dinged up . 
so if you have the same use for this item ,  do not buy this item . 
and the new one won t be a cuisinart . 
my babies will eat quinoa for egwhen i cook it for family meals . 
you ll get hooked ,  but then ,  oppsie ,  you don t really own the game . 
as much as i like hoppes num_extend solvent ,  putting it in an aerosol can is a very bad idea . 
it was the connector inside it that had broken off . 
this bag has a very bad smell to it . 
if you only hand wash it they might last longer ,  but not much . 
my wife took a sip and said  oh ,  that s bad ,   and never touched it again . 
the adhesive also seems to reflect light and causes a rainbow effect on white backgrounds . 
no outside pocket or ruger logos ,  but i think it is a better made product . 
they don t even ship in a box !  sheesh . 
i was charged for the product on the same day and i never received the item . 
i purchased this play food set after my twins got a play kitchen for the num_extend birthday . 
and ,  truth be told ,  it should look better . 
it always tells me that i need a new driver despite just loading it . 
it did make my face look nice without makeup ,  a nice glow that i knew wouldn t clog my pores . 
i bought this with high hopes and receive a poorly put together ,  awfully made product . 
generally very easy to assemble ,  but see negatives num_extend
the entire top lifts up so you can put your pet in . 
it seemed your character was always looking in the wrong direction when fighting . 
i dropped one of the baskets onto a vinyl not tile floor and it shattered . 
it was better for me to get a new phone than to get a new battery . 
the tip was made a little to thin and wouldn t sit right in the charging port . 
i was surprised to find the dust was still lingering on the collar several days later . 
i really came to depend upon amazon to give me the best product ,  price ,  and delivery . 
once we got it into position ,  we struggled to get the catch to hold . 
to bad ,  because otherwise this would be a great item . 
all the little rhinestones fell out the first day that i got it . 
tell amazon not to sell chinese chicken jerky until it is proven safe  and even then i d avoid it  . 
they could care less about rubber toys  unless the toy has a squeak they can kill .   . 
all the hassle makes us not want to play it much . 
i feel as if i wasted my money . i have trouble sleeping and thought this would work . 
in some cases ,  there s no indication that a device is a puzzle and not just a static display . 
i use it on sliced tomatoes that i roast for num_num minutes then add a bit of parmesan cheese . 
initially ,  i liked this watch ,  i really did . 
sony has proven it can build junk like the best .  .  . or .  .  . uh .  .  . worst of  em . 
should it be this hard to make a decent poop scoop ?  seriously . 
i try it out in my car with a voltage meter and it would not work . 
then it did not have any voice sounds . 
unless you have a dainty dog ,  i wouldn t buy this . 
i was looking for a nice flavoring item for hot air popped popcorn . 
the boring characters who join you all have lack luster and generic personas . 
also .  .  . this bra placed my breasts almost under my armpits . 
this game isn t worth $ much less $
check the collar at least once a day to make sure it s fitted properly . first week . 
does not work ,  it s a waste of money . 
the rattling is a foreign noise that makes no such noise in nature . 
after all was said and done ,  the dock does not work . 
he was in the crate ,  when i picked it up by the handle to move it over slightly . 
i am currently in a wheelchair and really need a pad that works . 
which is it and i leery of purchasing now . 
once past the steep learning curve in the game ,  all that stands in your way is time itself . 
i bought this for my daughter who complain that it was really grainy and gritty . 
it is very hard to successfully move and select troops ,  and it is nearly impossible to group them . 
i read about this as one of the miracle creams and was so happy to find amazon had it . 
too much for my comfort ,  so i returned it . 
good price but super sheer ,  not like what the models have on . 
i am definitely replacing these as soon as i move . 
i ve previously used body washes by aveeno ,  alba ,  nature s gate and yes to carrots ,  with no ill effects . 
just starting out on the gfcf diet for my autistic daughter . 
i wrote to amazon and they replaced but the same thing has happened . 
but ,  sure enough ,  the coffee is weak ,  the flavor has no complexity ,  no depth . 
controls were decent ,  learning curve pretty short num_extend this game brings nothing new to num_extend person shooters . 
this product left my hair dry and brittle after using it . 
one charger didn t work and the other  the car one  fell apart soon after i bought it . 
i just don t have enough strength in my hands to hold onto the levers and extract the cork . 
i own and love the gladiator soundtrack and it s amazing how many sections are pretty much exactly the same . 
there are screw holes in the handle so that you can easily store it on the wall if desired . 
eboost acai pomegranate booster does not have a good taste . 
i would recommend the zerochroma over this one ,  but it is also a lot more expensive . 
i was not the least bit impressed with this cutter . 
wasnt impressed at all !  maybe its just me  :   . 
you ll also be able to choose a pokemon partner who will be the one that awakens you . 
we will only get organic corn and unfortunately this is our only choice since we live in the boonies . 
not nit picky demands on very precise movements ,  with controllers that are anything but suited to such things . 
if i knew she didnt sing the whole rhyme ,  i would have never bought this book for my son . 
maybe for virgin mobile they make it as slow as num_extend
i was excited to get this because of the extra battery . 
we replaced the batteries ,  but that didn t help . 
there were the usual gem collecting and fun enemies . 
a variety of foods ,  whether you as parents like the foods or not . 
now i got num_num of them to toss out . 
there are numerous fabric strands all over the robe . 
we decided to change one out that is looking old and worn . 
might be ok for the beach if you want to have a white pasty look . 
this specific item is really misleading and i really don t like what i received . 
since it is plastic ,  it is broken now . 
it s a num_extend is my leave in conditioner of choice . 
it would drop the signal to both my wired and remote computers . 
i can t afford even at amazon prices to use this product . 
if you have time to waste good ,  you ll be spending hours here . 
the flavor was too artificial and not at all what i wanted . 
the sites report the same findings i found in my every day ,  unscientific ,  shooting . 
i am wondering if different ear pads would improve the situation . 
this collar also keeps her from jumping on my little niece and nephew ,  and stops unnecessary barking . 
bought this new and though it shows the lightning indicator as if its charging its does not charge it . 
they are extremely sharp ,  but i can t help but feel like i ve wasted about $ on these three knives . 
puts num_num icons on desktop when compact flash card is inserted . 
thus ,  i recommend you avoid the unit to avoid potentially wasting as much time with it as i have . 
ronson makes lighter fluid that works just as well in zippos ,  and is way cheaper . 
while uvb rays are behind the redness of sunburn ,  uva rays damage the skin s dna at a deeper layer . 
however if you ve never used stevia before and you buy this one ,  you may be disappointed . 
read the reviews and thought some people are just too picky . 
while saving a few minutes would be nice ,  i m not interested in getting alzheimers . 
unless they are somewhere later in the game ,  they don t make a return . 
the concept of comic book style with a video game is interesting though not a first . 
i popped it in the preheated num_extend oven with some leftover pizza for num_num minutes . 
otherwise ,  itwould have been fine and i could have used it . 
this toy was ripped apart in less then num_num hours . 
it just did not work out for me and i am returning it . 
i used hot glue to tack the foam to the plastic which solved the problem . 
this was suppose to be a upper end bluetooth . 
this leaves an uncleared area in the middle of the driver s viewing . 
for a group of num_num and num_num year olds this was really frustrating . 
well ,  my husband ,  myself and my num_num year old son sampled this drink . 
if not ,  jump on it ,  if they do ,  run for the hills . 
i was up all night with stomach cramps and diarrhea . 
the previous one lasted num_num years on similar scenario . 
taking the case off will definitly cause damage . 
this game has a script that is about two pages long ,  maybe less . 
not really satisfied as i have been with other bsa scopes . 
after like num_num months however they began only charging to num_num bars and ran out very quickly . 
we bought this for my daughter s birthday ,  and put this up at num_extend am yesterday for my three children . 
they look ok ,  but they can t hold my hair for long . 
i ll just wear a contact in the other eye until then . 
by day num_num the toy would not even turn on . 
rebooting has helped ,  at times ,  but it is very inconsistent . 
of course ,  the manual says mothing about this either . 
the conversion of the simpsons to a wrestling game went horribly wrong somewhere along the developement lines . 
and only one worked; the other did not . 
at least for this case that wasn t true . 
i agree wholeheartedly with other reviewers who didn t like this first aid kit . 
i was given this hand blender as a gift . 
i mean flying games are hard enough with a joy stick . 
the brand i originally was going to get didn t look right on the swatch . 
i really wanted a canister and for the price and the reviews this seemed like the best deal . 
i bought these thinking that they were regular hanes underwear . 
it is more fun than regular sand ,  but the mess is just about as bad . 
this is some kind of cheap material that is  hard  rather than soft and luxurious . 
windows xp  with num_extend detected it ,  loaded the drivers and prompted for my router s  linksys num_extend wep code . 
the rewind button will not stay locked when rewinding . 
these pants are thick ,  and they don t compress me very much ,  so they actually make my clothes fit tighter . 
close inspection of the eyepieces revealed uneven fitting between the lens holders and rubber that surrounds them . 
the slots dont work well for my carbon arrows so i just lay them in their . 
note ,  these are not the num_num inaccesible levels embedded in the original nes  super mario bros . 
i used it for less than a week and charged it num_num times . 
i received the charger num_num days later so can t complain about slow shipping . 
for the price ,  i find it expensive considering it does not adequately work to eliminate razor bumps . 
something tells me being on the show isn t as difficult as playing this game . 
i bought this at walgreens after reading the reviews ,  here ,  on amazon . 
that was the color i ordered per the listing ,  but i received hot pink . 
nobody would eat these ,  and i had to throw them away . 
i immediately returned them to amazon ,  and they are very good about that . 
bodum does make other teaware that performs satisfactorily ,  some items quite well . 
it s disgusting and impossible to choke down and now i can t return it as it has already been opened . 
it s a lot of trimmer for a very little benefit . 
i like the style of this and it looks great on the back of the phone . 
i would recommending going with one made of brass . 
it had climbing ,  a slide ,  num_num sports balls ,  and a basketball hoop . 
bought this thinking it would be entertaining with my num_extend
the hard boiled egg maker takes much longer than cooking on the stove with uneven results . 
this doesn t upset me although i am returning this one which only leaves me two . 
however ,  he also sounds like he s reading the script rather than acting it out . 
i bought these knifes because they looked fantastic and they were a steal . 
the laser beam on this is very small . 
one of those moments where you wish you would have just put in the extra money the first time . 
my displeasure with this item began with the description of the product . 
at least i only spent $ this time . 
it works a little ,  and is more convenient than the other products . 
i read where some people use it in place of cheese . 
the speedometer doesn t inspire confidence when inserting it into the mount  it doesn t feel very secure  . 
not a cd rom ,  as it is marked in the picture . 
material is very light weight ,  in the light i could see through the camo shorts . 
there are better ones out there ,  i will go back to the old gray brand i used before . 
overall i think we purchased a bad phone . 
they must have had tons of calls like this before . 
the only thing this piece of junk is worth is to save game data . 
it is not anything like what is pictured . 
the idea is that the visible led will also glow whenever ir is emitted . 
go pedal your wares elsewhere . on and ubuntu is replacing vista here . 
lasted about three months and the clip that holds the phone in place broke ,  rendering it useless . 
first the headband was too big ,  so it did not fit on my ear right . 
now made in china   see back of bag  . 
i think it should be mentioned that i received a package of these in a ziploc sandwich bag . 
with each one ,  the persons on the other end could not hear me . 
for on now i will just pay the $ fee to have my dog s nails clipped at the groomers . 
i d rather have the clear version then have the benifit of the mirrror . 
i bought num_num of these kits hoping they would work . 
the other reviews are correct about the small buttons . 
moved the radio four feet and problem solved . 
i don t think it should be considered a pomade . 
i love almost all tabasco products and living in louisiana ,  i can buy them local . 
i believe levi s has either changed the cut or it s where they are being made . 
i think mascara goes on best with pliable ,  soft lashes to work thru . 
needless to say i m not happy with toshiba s support of this product . 
needless to say ,  i will be returning this and not purchasing from this company again . 
they were almost as i remember ,  but in this instance ,  i thought these were a little bit stale . 
it was really funny watching the doves circle around and around trying to figure out how to land . 
i took it to keep out on the patio for my outside cat . 
i have personally worked on designing consumer products before ,  and this would never have gone out the door . 
and as i did ,  the power switch broke . 
but be warned ,  those adults and teens will need to be pretty talented at pictionary . 
the sound is great ,  and the waterproof is great ,  but what good is that if you can t wear them . 
looks like i ll be waiting for a crovel . 
ok first of all seller changes his seller name all the time ,  so beware of that . 
just carry a regular terry cloth hand towel . 
they were clever to put these flavors together . 
just did not hold up to my energetic kittens . 
so i suppose i will be buying the red or blue . 
and i kept applying frontline plus every num_num weeks to every animal in our house . 
after the update ,  the router kicked off any connected pc after num_num minutes . 
i really want another one but i m rather timid to pay for it again . 
get the mason lid adapters and use canning jars !  . 
i prefer the cinnamon at penzeys over this brand . 
it is weak and watery and has more coconut oil than actual cocoa . 
you can do much better for the same price at your local camera shop or best buy . 
these are all action games that the enemies and obstacles are in a pattern . 
much smoother than this blade does .  save your money . 
this thing will just frustrate you and fall apart . 
i gave downgraded it down to a num_num star . 
couldn t get my credit cards in or out . 
the pvp the fun part rarely happens due to the broken combat . 
i didn t risk it by buying the xl . 
and besides ,  what good is a handheld game system without that beloved ,  little red plumber ? b . 
this is the absolute worst product i have ever used on my hair . 
it s a small jar and once the lady bugs finally arrived ,  they never ended up hatching . 
just found out that sesame seed price is up this year due to shortage !  . 
dog was not interested in this product what so ever . 
the cord is also very short to be pulling aroound . 
i don t intend to finish the full month . 
i actually got an upset stomach from them . 
i have found num_num packs already which contain mold patch . 
i emailed otterbox customer service and never got a response . 
first ,  the rubber eargels were extremely difficult to get on the headset . 
if you have it in mind that you are buying  hot chocolate  with a milky or creamy flavor . 
sorry ,  not my choice for a good sequel . 
it wouldn t hold a charge for longer than an hour . 
anyway ,  i m sending them back for a refund will be asking my wife s permission to run the wire . 
this claims that its for an htc evo num_extend design phone ,  which is what i have . 
we gave this carrier to the thrift store and purchased a different one . 
i used this every night and sometimes during the day for num_num weeks . 
it holds on the dashboard beautifully ,  whereas this one does not . 
so much for the sound quality . the durability isn t good . 
i foresee these two items ,  if i use them much at all ,  tearing off in no time . 
i loved the features on the phone and the flip lid was great . 
don t see how it could begin to protect feet . 
but the mane portion basically ruins this product . 
and it sounds like a plane taking off when you turn it on . 
the sound is good and the price is right ,  but it s not a model of reliability . 
it cost a little bit more ,  but is a better value . 
it used to cost num_extend cents per ounce ,  now it s $
i have num_num elderly cats that could benefit from extra calories in their diets . 
as for the smell ,  it s very old lady like to me . 
while hunting ,  the sling mount gave way and my shotgun ended up in the dirt . 
the only substantial difference between the two bundles is the value pack comes with a num_num mb memory card . 
hopefully they ll be a better fit and quality . 
most of my reloading gear is made and purchased from lyman . 
because they have a generous cut . just note that the navy blue shirt is very dark . 
ended up usingthe dowel for something else thought !  . 
the tutorial simply wouldn t recognize my mouse s middle button clicks . 
so ,  had to tape it up and rely on the left one . 
it plays ,  but without a display it s next to useless . 
had avias in the past and was well pleased . 
wish i would have gone with another brand . 
we can t afford to buy special memory for each and every device . 
i was never able to get consistent results . 
this cup is painted with something nasty ,  looks like straight lead ,  rubs off like lead too ,  thanks china . 
i used lemon to clear up the scaring . 
i have a full size wahl trimmer that i use that works better . 
the front portion did not fit my evo shift ,  it comes off easily . 
so that s not really my take on it ,  but my cat s !  and you know how finicky they can be . 
if you re looking for everyday ,  bass heavy listening ,  the jabra s are actually pretty decent . fit :  the fit is not bad . 
i am disappointed because i really liked wearing them . 
although it is a really cute case ,  it can t stand up to daily use . 
much more than several other organic brands i ve tried . 
whats not so good is when you order this product it shows num_num oz . 
my eyes look as though i ve never used anything at all . 
i have tried other products as well but to no avail !  . 
there is nothing quality about it in flavor or mouth appeal . 
in plain english they cannot do their jobs often breaking things that do work . 
once again ,  no parental control lets me adjust what is loaded on the dog . 
these bags may be fine for leaves ,  but they are unacceptable for trash barrels . 
hamsters can run up to num_num miles in a night . 
it s definitely not high end or even mediocre . 
made litter stink even worse than it did without this product . 
it removes all of the lower frequencies and just leaves the upper frequencies . 
still ,  the graphics are decent ,  and are part of the gameplay so i won t knock them down for it . 
the treads on the windage adjustment portion of the tool stripped with very little pressure . 
when taking the price into account this purchase has been a tremendous disappointment . 
and then it didn t even have the decency to glow . 
casio is promoting products to compile versions to work with the be ,  but currently there is virtually nothing . 
dark sector s mediocre graphics and paltry story can be overlooked for its concise ,  linear gameplay ,  and engaging combat . 
three weeks later i still haven t heard back from archos tech support . 
i think the animations are ,  for the most part ,  pretty strong ,  with very little shimmering . 
i ordered this same pill organizer from amazon several years ago ,  and it was great . 
okay ,  so ,  tissue paper is thin to begin with . 
and the roll itself is actual smaller than a regular paper towel roll . 
very disappointing when they change a good thing !  !  . 
it is disappointing as the mat was good at catching litter . 
i ve had two of these logitech controllers for my num_extend
not very good symmetry when obvious i was replacing high beam headlights not my fog lights . 
this purchase was not worth it for my cat . 
betty crocker s had an  off  taste and nobody would finish it . 
i bought this because of the rave reviews on ytube . 
i don t know about you ,  but when i need to reload i try to take cover . 
it was always so red after i washed it . 
the scroll ring on the expert was junk . 
it needs to be much more rigid than it is . 
the temp is always about num_num degrees and low humidity . 
i just returned from italy and tuscany where i sampled some of the best olive oils in the world . 
it tended to go well with apple and pears ,  but not with orange ,  lemons or limes . 
i checked the voltage today on num_num  new  ones which shows only num_extend
if you do plan on getting this for a rifle ,  make sure it s for a num_extend or airsoft . 
this was offered as new ,  but after receiving the product it was clearly not new . 
it s slow rolling so he can guide it easier . 
i was hoping this one would just do it better ,  but it fails completely . 
the hazelnuts are lost in that variety ,  too; had such high expectations and these just fell flat . 
this does not come in a bar as the picture suggests . 
personally ,  i think i ve heard better things about clairsonic and wish i d tried that instead . 
i see several other people have experienced similar stinging as i did . 
which was a waist of a scoop of good folgers coffee . 
so save your money; stay away from these products and their outrageous claims . 
i contacted amazon and they apologized for the sellers poor quality . 
although this tea tastes great ,  the bags are very flimsy . 
i followed the instructions exactly ,  even used baby powder ,  and waxed part of my armpit . 
the power cord is about num_extend long ,  as is the air tube . 
i put num_num of these caps on standard yakima round bars . 
they ve gone back to amazon and i ll try another brand . 
i pretty much have to slam the sun visor to get this to turn on . 
the pomade is too thin and likely won t hold many people s hair . 
our new shipment of another brand is scheduled to be sent out next month . 
after using two of them i couldn t get it to work right . 
the antenna is very directional and you ll have to reposition it between stations . 
i do not recommend ordering this product it seems sketchy as far as durability . 
this num_extend sucked and this game is a prime example of why . 
you have to charge it by itself ,  off of the phone . 
my other organic bar soaps lasts quadruple the time this soap lasted . 
disappointing to receive a compass that will not point north . 
the hiss was constant and the audio was just bad . 
any sort of dried food or drink on a fridge or stove will not come off . 
i did not try the cloth on any other metals ,  so i can t comment on its general effectiveness . 
when the tray begin to close ,  the disc turns gracefully into position before the tray is fully closed . 
i personally don t like playing a game with so many bugs . 
i m not saying that this is intentional ,  but production standards for everything are very very low . 
got this for my german shorthaired pointer and my lab mix . 
the flavor is not a favorite of mine but others in my family like them . 
i only tried it for less than num_num minutes but that was enough . 
use a bluetooth instead or get a new phone  or cell providor  . 
it also had a num_num day return policy . 
if your considering this game ,  try imperium galactica num_extend
i have to feed her seperate from her brother ,  neiman . 
the positioning of the vibrating bullet didn t really stimulate either of us . 
it takes a very long time to charge . 
i wanted to try the  fur  one instead . 
at one year they can t put the blocks into the side at least my girls cant  . 
what s worse ,  it s carcinogenic and it damages your brain . 
the white rim got dirty very fast and it was not easy to clean . 
this use to be a very good game full of depth . 
that s why i have a couple handfuls of olay products on my vanity and only a few roc ones . 
these are great for heavier times during your cycle ,  sorry ,  it s just the truth !  . 
i gave this num_num stars because just like another reviewer said ,  it looks nice . 
set up is much simpler than other coffeemakers with filters . 
i ve tried going different directions ,  different angles ,  etc . 
first ,  let me say ,  i bought these boots @ boscov s because they were on sale ,  and cheaper . 
once that happened not matter how hard we tried we couldnt get it to go back in . 
players can also occasionally take to the skies during combat ,  but that gimmick burns out quickly . 
i must have misunderstood how this siphon works . 
but it was my own perception and was not the pillow s fault . someone else may like it . 
will now have to go through the trouble of replacement . 
this kit might contain a discontinued num_extend charger and batteries . 
this  heated pad  is not actually a pad at all . 
it was made more like a women;s shirt ,  not a man s tshirt . 
this reminds me of koolaid but more expensive . 
now it s just a big lump of plastic on my arm . 
i wanted to find something positive in my experience ,  so i tried it over ice . 
this toy has a great concept ,  except it is not durable to my dogs . 
amazon made it right immediately and i sent them back . 
so you have to finish the job manually . 
i ve read other reviews that criticize these pants for being too light weight and not being actual sweat pants . 
pulled the rivet straight off the rim of the snap . 
i think its wrong that amazon markets this crap as stevia instead of stevia with maltodextrin . 
seems like more time was spent on advertising than the actual fragrance . 
the next replacement will probably be a zagg or something similar . 
this is an unacceptable design flaw !  now the kickstand doesn t stay in the case body . 
first ,  i bought a large ,  then an extra large  xl  . 
after several dishwasher cycles ,  it had warped slightly ,  and wouldn t sit flat on my countertop . 
save yourself some money and invest in a reputable brand . 
needless to say i will never read her blog again or buy this awful shampoo . 
we got it for him when he was num_num mo old . 
there s a good reason why so many people are selling this game in the amazon . com marketplace . 
as i mentioned ,  i cannot use this unit period . 
so ,  less than two months ,  and the headset is useless . 
i ve tried the lysine cream and abreva and frankly don t know what ,  if anything ,  either of these creams do . 
the two different head shapes are much more effective . 
i have been doing yard work for num_num years ,  so i am no  backyard rookie  . 
i ordered a pair of these headphones after reading numerous reviews about how comfortable and great sounding they were . 
likewise sony doesn t have much original content which isn t also on the num_num and sometimes even the wii . 
the sound effects are average with nothing special about them . 
as such ,  it doesn t pick up everything either . 
i took it off and made belt loop with num_num cord . 
i will likely never buy another waring product again . 
charged it again and died within an hour . 
i destroyed it looking for a a fuse so i couldn t return it ,  my fault . 
i don t know why they didn t go with that . 
one reason to buy circumnaural  around the ear  headphones is to reduce environmental sound . these headphones block nothing at all .  .  .  . nothing . 
i loved it while it worked ,  but will be sending it back . 
there are so many bugs and glitches in this thing that it s better suited as a paperweight . 
i read the reviews carefully and made sure not to move the machine . 
the description for this item is very poor . 
when she was num_num the straps dry rotted and wouldn t adjust anymore ,  then they finally broke . 
it was beyond the window of being able able to return them by the time i discovered the issue . 
i can appreciate the programming ,  but the game play isn t for me . 
second the only way to unlock outfits is to keep playing match after dull and uninspired match . 
this is one of the worse tasting soups i ve ever eaten . 
this is a cheap bike mount ,  in every definition of the term . 
not too hard to get on or off . 
worked out well until the power button fell off . 
i guess that my condition just doesn t seem to work . 
most of the crucial ingredients are lumped together into a single line item  i . e . 
i ran it on batteries and drove to different locations within num_num miles of my house . 
this maybe a better optic for a num_extend caliber rifle or perhaps an air soft rifle . 
and he is always running out of ammo ,  and forced to feebly swat with that knife . 
i feel like suing the manufacturer of this company . 
as always these things never last long at all . 
a bodum  cup  is num_num ounces ,  not num_extend
breaking these at any point in the stick will lead to a mess . 
this spatula is useless for anything but decoration . 
there are so many on the market these days there are definitely better options out there . 
my num_extend wireless piece sounded better ,  and operated at a functional capacity to a greater distance than this one . 
bottom line is don t buy it ,  it wont work in your phone . 
a real disappointment and i would not recommend it for anyone . 
would change my star rating to zero if possible . 
if i had known it was not dishwasher safe ,  i would have bought another one that is dishwasher safe . 
what good is good sound if they re impossible to wear comfortably ?  . 
the rep from frieling claimed theirs came in a cloth bag which the one from amazon did not . 
i have purchased this ball before ,  a few years ago . 
i saw this card and thought  what a great idea !   and ordered it . 
add this to the files of perfumes almost everyone loves except me . 
i was excited to have a little retro fun item to use to talk on my cell phone . 
we have allergies and know the things we can and cannot have . 
so i bought this for my boyfriend cause he always messes up his screen protectors . 
who is giving this good reviews ?  this has to be the worst rpg on num_extend
just another example of how much soul calibur sucks !  !  . 
i loved this case for a few weeks . 
this is incredibly damaging ,  worse than the stuff that comes in splat boxes . 
i never got a results anywhere near as good as bottled soda water . 
if my cell phone rings all data in the handheld is lost . 
well ,  i added up the carbs ,  fat and protein and the label just doesn t add up . 
the only ones they actually play with are the magformers and the superstrucks . 
if you are used to inputting data using graffiti ,  you may be very disappointed like me with this model . 
the charge for labor was $ and the total was $
one which has skin problems and i had hoped brewers yeast would help him out . 
the dial is pretty ,  but it s difficult to read . 
i got it and it feels like a ladies watch . 
i found that the hard plastic cup in the center was hard on my gums . 
i was extremely excited to test it out . 
i bought it to pick up dog hair every couple of days . 
if you salt your food you probably will not notice the salty taste . 
also there is not a single american plane to choose from . 
she prefers a cardboard scratch pad from target . 
this slicer with quality plastic would be the world s best cheese slicer . 
windows tried to download the appropriate software and was unable . 
maybe i got a bad one ,  maybe i didn t ,  but i wouldn t buy it . 
it wouldn t recognize the controller as even being hooked up to the station on a game . 
poop all i have to say you get what you pay fori got them in time and all . 
if you ever feel haunted ,  though ,  by a life less perfect ,  stick to scotch and tylenol pm . 
the phone will get the job done ,  but it s no speed demon . 
it is not good for your cat or the environment . 
they didn t tell me it was such a bad blender because they didn t want to hurt my feelings . 
venison is way down on the list now . 
i purchased these bags for organizing gear in my pack ,  be aware these are very ,  very small . 
i love those for casual wear on warm days . 
she likes the packing box more than the toy . 
try comparing this speaker before you buy and i guarantee you ll immediately see what i mean . 
i don t think her coat was dramatically affected ,  maybe it was a little bit shinier . 
i ordered the bra in my regular size num_extend and it s far too tight . 
the attacks are not coordinated and the enemies are plain . 
i love that this is a natural remedy ,  but unfortunately my dog thought it tasted great too . 
i ran and washed my face in the bathroom ,  but it didn t help . 
in fact ,  the clinique product doesn t work as well as my homespun versions . 
it came made for a tween with a cups ,  when i ordered something more on the c end . 
however ,  it does the job that i need it for . 
there were practically no pumpkin seeds or cheese on this last batch . 
four hours of letting something install .  .  . what is this ,  num_extend c mon ,  this is ridiculous . 
i am an extreme gamer ,  and the information lost was cumulative weeks of time of my life lost . 
i recently picked up pantene split end repair ,  which works so much better on my hair . 
but then she expected to get a star for doing it . 
i use things exactly as it directs ,  no deviations . 
didn t even have it num_num months when it started having problems . 
i still have the rashes on my belly and back after num_num days of treating it . 
perhaps purina want to ensure that you buy more of the pellets and pads by making them inneficient . 
to start with the shipping was a nightmare . 
conversations that go like  how are you ?    i am ok .    you look cold   i am cold   thank you  . 
the only cool thing is when you re flying for a bit and you break the sound barrier . 
if you want a fairly soft ball this is it . 
most of the boards are stupid and cheap and will just make you mad . then we have single player mode . 
i guess i m the voice of dissent ,  but i didn t care for this game at all . 
they always felt if they were going to come apart . 
i m looking for something better next pay day . 
of vitamin c ,  which supports your immune system and promotes overall health . 
they still sell my at the same price as the zen . 
i love lemon and was looking for an organic product that would give me a bit of lemon flavor . 
where do they find these idiots that approved this project . 
but with this first aid kit its completely unwarranted . 
this of course is link and or his descendents . 
on the down side ,  the unit is quite noisy when operating . 
that in itself is disappointing ! secondly ,  the single player game   .  .  .   big time . 
but ,  it was new packaging and missing the parts bag so i coulldn t assemble it . 
they gave it a decorative lace material that is just scratchy . 
this was the first playset that my daughter received for the littlest pet shop series . 
the digital display is small and dim and in moderate to bright light ,  it is very difficult to read . 
i think i m going back to laura mercier s creamy bronzing palette . 
then i followed the vaguely written instructions enclosed and made the network adjustments . 
i was able to buy another version minus the animal based capsule . 
and if you are new ,  you will be excited as well . 
the magnet fastener seems like a good idea ,  but it s not too practical in use . 
the num_num caplets don t really last long here :  you need to take num_num at a time . 
it s a shame that it cannot do its job . 
so both the maxell and the coby get num_num star from me . 
so ,  i contaced amazon and had a replacement sent . 
then when pulling the cable out of the phone ,  i felt a little pop . 
we poured the rest of the pot out . 
the suction is ok but there are too many design flaws on this product . 
i have light brown hair and these earrings picked up my hair color . 
bought a pannier ,  put the wald in my pannier ,  rode my bike down the street and gave it away . 
just buy a better one i wouldn t buy this one . 
i ve played battleship before at a family member s house . 
so i started typing my emails n stuff in a word doc and copy pasting num_extend
so anyway ,  it was a birthday gift for my num_num year old daughter . 
had the same issue with a restaurant adding bread crumbs to hamburger . 
this basket is truly the gift for those you dislike . 
it is a sturdy toy but my two granddaughters were unable to ride . 
it is louder than it s bigger brother the num_extend
by the third day i was getting severe irritation . 
and now ,  it does not work at all . 
they are showing excessive anger toward each other . 
the scent is barely there so it leaves no smell in your hair . 
computer locked up anywhere from immediately to around an hour when using the linksys num_extend
if you cat needs extra calories ,  try baby food ,  the pure meat varieties . 
the only time it showed some sort of life was when i played some beastie boys . 
lycra is great for undershirts  and i have a good build  . 
my grand daughter could not walk in them . 
most other soups of this type has a lot of flavor and needs no additional seasonings . 
this game has very good graphics and ok controls ,  but overall a very tedious game . 
the plantronics explorer num_num bluetooth headset is cheap ,  light ,  and easy to pair with a cell phone . 
i have not recieved my phone cover yet . 
i checked the screws fastening it to the wall ,  and they hadn t been removed or changed . 
i let mine inflate and then i add a few extra puffs of air until its filled right . 
also ,  the game is completely boring and last maybe num_num minutes at best . 
yet ,  this pack was purchased specifically recharging an iphone when traveling . 
i tried adding water just in case i didn t have enough but to no avail . 
sad .  .  . loved it back in the winter and spring . 
the longstrike is limited in rate of fire especially with the bolt action . 
it is also almost impossible to do once all of the pieces have been taken off . 
if you do buy it ,  be prepared that you might have to return it . update : customer service as iottie is excellent . 
no amount of messing around with the controls or resetting helped . 
the shoe has a bit of a platform bottom ,  so it puts you up a little higher than  flats  . 
deleting ,  whether forward or back is also annoyingly slow . 
friends call and leave me voice messages ,  but no message is there . 
basically only used to chop up some onion maybe once a week or less . 
the problem is that each of the campaigns treat you as if you ve never played the game before . 
in one side pocket i have a little vera bradley journal . 
i was shocked at the poor quality of this device . 
oh !  for the days when one could buy a good vcr . transport  tape motion mechanism  is lousy ,  lacks features . 
you also have to deal with  the throne  in spire  no pun intended  . 
i changed water everyday and i only use it for num_num hours a day . 
the quality of the boots are very poor . 
however ,  i did have to get a different case because my signal was terrible  a whole bar or num_extend
this unit is nothing like the old one . 
the num_num screen protector is clear and fits ,  but this one not the case . 
it causes chemical burns that you do not initially feel . 
i am glad i caught it before i couldn t tell which one was which . 
you can just imagine what happened when someone sat in that chair . 
we have one driver with a $ dollar ticket due to this gps routing him down the wrong road . 
it is a powder in a foil packet . 
some of the worst rechargable nimh batteries i have ever had the displeasure of using . 
this is literally a cardboard tube with a label glued to it . 
held an edge ,  easy open and close with one hand . 
the controls were good ,  the graphics were nice and tidy ,  and the music was so good . but the bad . 
so i looked up the possibility of returning it . 
the cream itself is very rich and wonderful feeling . 
the lotion itself was fine; i have problem dry skin ,  and this moisturized without feeling greasy . 
and i expect most people would be happy now . 
this case offers nearly no protection at all . 
the could a good product but it has a fatal design flaw which make it a complete ripoff . 
i think it probably needs to be a finer grind ,  at least . 
sadly i bought two ,  gladly they were cheap . 
i m disappointed because i really like the minty ,  invigorating feeling when i washed my face with this cleanser . 
my dog broke the metal holder within num_num days . 
i should be a large and this cami is more like a small . 
the capsules are easy to take because they only contain num_num milligrams each . 
full disclosure .  .  .  . i haven t purchased this product ,  but did buy a different screen cleaner . 
don t get me wrong ,  they were pretty ,  very pretty . 
the nivea product mention above gets the same review as this proraso item . 
impossible to match up the cut outs where they belong . 
i mean you really have to wonder why they bothered to make this awful game . 
it was pretty comfortable ,  and was very good at providing insulation beneath you in cold weather . 
i certainly wouldn t have bought it if i had read them first . 
afraid it was about to burn up ,  i tried to shut it off with the timer but could not . 
the sound was average and it does make a difference on how you seat the ear buds . 
luckily i noticed and picked the camera up off the ground . 
i ordered a women s num_extend and i received a men s ,  huge ,  and they were even the wrong color . 
ate a brownie at num_num am ,  was sick at num_extend bloated ,  gut pain . 
just say no to this one !  save your money !  . 
i bought this with high hopes after reading all the num_num star reviews . 
despite some positive reviews ,  i found the product to be uncomfortable ,  flattening ,  and generally lacking in support . 
after months of taking great care of the tadpole it was finally looking like a frog . 
so don t buy it unless you like bad unmodern graphics . 
i m very disappointed in this num_extend case and will be returning it . 
i should have keep my money on this one it makes my skin appear orange . 
they don t hold makeup on them unless you use a lot and i had on primer . 
this polishing pad was marked good for num_extend
it slipped in my hands after i installed it . 
i should have just bought a dustbuster ,  because as a vacuum it s annoying and useless . 
it could have helped ,  but if it did ,  it wasn t something i noticed . 
in comparison to other dark roast brands ,  i simply cannot recommend this one . 
i do know a number of people who get great results for their dogs and swear by the product . 
i highly recommend mark rippetoe s starting strength over num_extend
after a couple of weeks ,  i  settled in  with the razor as the instructions suggested . 
your phone is screaming to you and you are screaming at it ,  but the connection is not there . 
the security clasps are not even long enough to secure to her harness . 
provided your feet are in good condition to start with . 
when i received the case ,  i felt a little upset . 
i wanted pretty design and a coiled cord ,  so i took a risk with koss . 
its signal range was also very short requiring very close placement to any radio device . 
i want to look nice ,  neat and casual . 
the straw is also made in num_num parts so you have to put it together . 
the bodies i have had no longer read the lens . 
take this one out of your line of products ,  dr . 
if i dropped all the sliders down to the bottom then the hiss and static where gone . 
i have num_num dogs ,  they love ham bones . 
seems to be broken or shorted somewhere near the connector to the computer . 
the num_extend energizers c  num_num are a very bad deal num_extend edit :  num_num days later . 
what a total and complete ripoff of num_num bucks . 
i they seemed to work so i thought ok whatever ,  i got a good deal . 
this year has been the worst year so far for fleas . 
i ve been using the laptop without a cooler but i m very careful not to block any vents . 
the cookie crumbles leaving a dry mess of rice flour and hardish chewy fruity bits in your mouth . 
the amount is huge for the price ,  but i wish i had spent my money on something better . 
how can you take madden out of madden football ?  . 
so ,  where is the background noise coming from ?  speaker sounds like its cone is made of rice paper . 
not only is the salad bar open ,  but i m obviously using a peppery salad dressing that the critters love . 
this item appears as the seller described but did not work as supposed to . 
the picture had bands of interference in it . 
it came in already broken with two eye ruber pieces falling apart . 
we ended up getting num_num of these for xmas . 
it smells good at firsts but after a while that self tanner smell starts to creep in . 
bad design ,  too bulky and difficult to situate . 
i was not pleased with the picture at all . 
sulfates are well known to strip color from hair . 
i tried so hard to get into this game . 
i cant believe people gave this game a good rating . 
i had to use more and more strength to keep it where i wanted it . 
not a good productdoesn t hold the cards welldoesn t fit well in pocket due to bulky sidescash falls out . 
there s nothing more disturbing than your dog yipping when on a walk . 
what this game simulates ,  however ,  i have no idea ?  this game .  .  . is   .  .  .   !  . 
i read many good reviews for these trimmers . 
i will just stick with my loreal top coat . 
but the company will replace the deodorant if it doesn t work . 
i bought these about num_num months ago and still have a few bags left . 
i am pleased with the sound quality of the device . 
i try this ,  my forehead laugh at it ,  no response week one . 
setting this up is more trouble than the battery operated ones . 
sulfate is not good for hair ,  at least mine anyway . 
keyword :  boring . graphics :  great . about as repetitive as assassins creed . 
i can not verify if this product provides good protien supprt . 
i should have done more research before ordering . 
the first one was just hot and plain . 
only one of the two jets allowed cleaner to come out ,  it flowed out but did not spray . 
the design of this game is really cute . 
something is dampening the resonance and it just sounds like something rubbing against some metal . 
even if it is ,  it s far less convenient and not what i ordered . 
now that it s made from concentrate it tastes weak and spoiled . 
but the conair pad died very quickly ,  in a matter of months . 
maybe she has an allergy to it ?  ?  ?  ?  i know i have this problem with most eye washes myself . 
vet says it is good for the dog s coat ,  but the smell is horrible . 
yes ,  they work which is why they got a num_extend star ,  but they re awful . 
i only buy % cotton as the blended stuff makes me itch . 
i would not recommend buying this since it broke the day after i received it . 
you are better off buying a cheap polish . 
these were so dry and stale that all i did was throw them out . 
carbonated just not like what i would call a good carbonation like soda or mountain dew . 
the quality of the cable is nice but it does not function correctly . in short : don t bother with this . 
it gets so blurry at times that you literally can t see a single thing . 
num_num days later he came in and handed the battery back to me . 
it was a gift for someone and the first day they used it ,  it broke . 
i ll use jason toothpaste but their soap isn t  clean  . 
i like the delivery system on this ,  it beats the heck out of the squeeze pump . 
i sent it back and got a full refund . 
i am glad they did not cost much . 
i emailed the company and they re sent me another one and it wouldnt charge either . 
i had nothing but trouble with these headphones . 
i later learned that other bugs are in the game . 
this is a trapizodial box with a zipper top . 
product is not even in a sealed container . 
this gently used basic remote made by canon is % trash . 
i returned mine with the message that it was not all natural ,  as advertised . 
installed one ,  then compared the brightness  at night  . 
he doesn t ever choose to chew on this one . 
i took it to an authorized jvc repair place in november and it s been there ever since . 
i give this stinkburger a num_num out of num_extend
i suppose they figure for the price you re just going to eat it and move along . 
not only does it have more calories and carbohydrates than my usual tonic ,  it actually taste far too sweet . 
first let me tell you what i like about this mini steamer . 
someone must write a book on this issue . 
the product sometime it charges and sometime it would say it would not recognize the devise charging . 
washable markers wipe right off the same table with a damp rag . 
the authorized service dealer couldn t obtain a new part . 
if you don t want to breathe ,  this product is for you . 
the women generally found it childish and grating ,  and not in a good way . 
these are no longer made in germany and are overrated and too costly . 
in this case ,  they need to clearly specify the type shaving cream can the unit is designed for . 
i purchased the wirless g router and pci card ,  which all installed fairly easy . 
they need to pass along this type of engineering and quality to their other devices . 
i bought this on the recomendation of another poster who had gallbladder surgery . 
that s the real graphics !  !  !  the console is heavy as hell due to its contents . 
however ,  i did not have any luck with it after trying this and several other brands . 
it is a great looking product new and it does catch crumbs through the slats in the base . 
are all these people real ?  i do not know what to do with this stick ,  really . 
this product was somewhat difficult to apply and probably took around an hour for my eyelashes . 
it usually takes about num_num minutes before the discomfort becomes hurt . 
six months later i have to buy a new vacuum because the bissel no longer works at all . 
when setup for blowing ,  they are pointed at the ground . 
i guess i will stick with whey protein . 
i bought two ,  however ,  and the second was able to be attached a few times so far without issue . 
did not fit my dog even though i purchased the recommended size . 
i purchased because we wanted a place to hang some of our pots ,  etc . 
shenmue really isn t a video game at all . 
no longer will you be gimped for the rest of the level if you take a few hits . 
the problem is ,  the veggie holder just does not grab and hold . 
not organic chicken just the hormone pumped junk you wouldn t eat yourself . 
they tweaked ,  messed with and took away ,  yet i stayed . 
not unlimited data .  .  . they cap it at a certain amount . 
continue to hold the reset button for another num_num seconds and pull product out of the num_extend
i also purchased this item because it contained a variety of flavors to taste test . 
they have a weird flavor ,  kind of a chemical sweet taste to them . 
he is the worst main character out of every final fantasy . 
the straight blade is tiny and not sharp . 
a design flaw in my opinion ,  and not reflected accurately in the picture . 
sometimes a button press would do nothing and other times it would half way work . 
it s put together with cheap ,  and i mean cheap aluminum hooks and springs . 
at least not until someone makes one similar to the orbit that really works . 
the smell seemed to coat my nostrils for at least a half hour later . 
poor quality ,  buttons are impossible to push ,  enormous . 
i just don t really see the market for these things at this price . 
but it will keep you busy much longer . 
first of all ,  these little bunnies are delicious . 
i m anywhere from a num_extend to a num_extend
it is just some elastic cheaply sewn in to the pad . 
i paid close to $ dollars for them  not through amazon  . 
i ordered this proctor silex electric kettle on a whim and the price was good . 
i am a father who grew up plaing video games and have owned multiple systems both console and portable . 
i used them once and already i was concerned they would slip out from under me . 
unfortunately ,  i hung it regardless ,  making sure to tighten the hold downs with all my strength . 
the cinematic features of the game were not disappointing . 
i left it on quite a bit longer but then it was gone when i rinsed . 
please dont use it if you have sensitive skin like me . 
the intensity of the flavoring is all over the park . 
the construction quality is not bad ,  however it starts peeling in just a couple of days . 
i m not going to lie ,  this is a very tasty product and a great snack . 
i recommend using something a little more costly and better manufactured . 
i ll keep buying regular altoids which are the best . 
plus ,  the chocolate powder was very difficult to remove from my num_extend
this product made no difference in their behavior . 
not good for anybody taking protein supplements for weight training and physique . 
i previously had a mega which worked a couple years . 
the product seemed to work well ,  but lasted only two trips . 
but ,  i decided to give this a try . 
not even worth the $ price tag after shipping . 
i barely got to this page on it . 
this stuff is so bad that i had to throw out my entire coffee and smoothie . 
i don t work for any holster company ,  its just my opinion based on owning plenty of holsters . 
so ,  to all those who are considering the game ,  run  don t walk  away from this game . 
i used it daily as recommended but it proved to be just another promise in a bottle . 
other than the large blade swing back ,  the rest of the tools are great . 
i ve never spilled so much powder as i do with this scoop . 
a lot more ,  as they have practically nothing compared to what s available for the android community at large . 
i bought the hot spot about three months ago to use on the occasional bothersome zit . 
i can t say i gave this a real chance ,  but i should have taken the reviews more seriously . 
i fixed all my pc problems by replacing this drive . don t waste your time and money on this one . 
this bandana doesn t cover much ,  and doesn t cool much . 
i just will not order this product again . 
i did not bother to print many photos because i found i was constantly replacing ink cartridges . 
the only problem i have with this is comfort . overall i wouldn t recommend it . 
don t bother . feels like it s made of some plastic material  though i m sure it s not  . 
you would think such a prestigious german brand wouldn t overlook such a simple and basic design detail   !  !  !   . 
surely someone in their late num_extend would be able to answer most ,  if not all of the questions . 
replaced it with a model with leather strap ,  but one day the crystal just . 
i bought this excitedly for my num_num yr old for christmas . 
i ve tried every gadget out there including a few home remedies such as rubber gloves etc . 
this chicken water has a bitter aftertaste and no flavor . 
i had them out for at least two weeks and they didn t catch one moth . 
too bad i gave it away ! i will see how their rma process works . 
there were three  protectors  in the package and not the four that some reviewers received . 
i have used this a few times and will be giving it away . 
fortunately for me i ordered two different types of stocking and am glad i did . 
it doesn t look as neat ,  but at least it works everytime . 
creatine proven to help with recovery and help increase production at the gym . 
i have tried a lot of different things and am unable to get the product to work . 
i was using it on a skillet on the range at medium heat . 
the install procedure in the manual is wrong  according to tech support  . 
this reminds me of a product that i tried in my teens . 
the mask is not pliable in the least bit . 
like the design and real cool but big down side resigns in that the case catches on pockets . 
how stupid ,  i am going in the ocean ,  in salt water under the sun . 
they said this would be their extreme end of useful product life . 
i m always leery of buying certain things online when you can t see the quality of manufacture first . 
the hip straps are placed too narrowly alongside the back of the pack . 
the usb connector that sends out the signal is too big and in the way . 
it was itchy and the place where it fastened dug way into my ribs whenever i moved . 
can i wear them with clothes over them ?  not a chance . 
however ,  the first wagon broke immediately; the horizontal metal holding the handle snapped during num_num minutes of use . 
my hair dried to styling point within num_num minutes instead of num_extend
i even tried soaking it overnight in soapy water and cleaning it with a brush . 
all they do now is count down over and over and over ,  never taking a reading . 
what a let down for my son and i . 
i have fair skin with redness in my cheeks  it s not rosacea  . 
after a month they had still not shipped . 
i stopped using it after num_num weeks and started using another cleanser . 
it s not exactly great ,  but not the worst i ve ever seen . 
just use bathroom scissors if you can keep yours sharp . 
he speaks num_num sayings in english and num_num in spanish . 
however ,  even the addition of some celery would have improved both the consistency and taste of the soup . 
this doesn t make any sense . also ,  what made the original ghost recon unique has been taken out of this game . 
one that i hope will not resurface in the next installment . my recommendation is to skip this one . 
i find myself repeatedly twisting the thing back into place . 
silly little piece of metal thought it was a knife . 
the line is really fine and the pen is easy to use but this dried out within a week . 
if you want to use this where you might want to occasionally change the configuration  i . e . 
as with all my reviews regarding kitchen gear ,  they are from two perspectives :  mine  of course  ,  and my spouse s . 
however ,  it is true to size and well made . 
if i didin t do this , it wouldn t work at all . 
in any case ,  sound is decent ,  with a lack of bass . 
fyi if you are considering using this for biscotti . 
as noted by other reviewers ,  this item is very well made . 
this is the reason why i sent it back . 
but ,  really ,  there are better choices out there . 
i can t really say that anyone is good enough to react fast enough to all occasions . 
typical of things made in china ,  this product promises rugged durability ,  but lets us down completely . 
but this is not a device for folks which aren t good with advanced network configurations . 
only guess what ?  they changed the brush  the exact same model !   and no longer give the time . 
so i received my jawbone era and it did not work at all . 
this time i didn t even get to hear three minutes of the art and his jazz messengers . 
what i got was a garish collection of these that were far too ugly to use on anything . 
purposely mis advertizing ?  seems so . french quality would last longer . 
in recent years i have been cutting down on coffee . 
this product was disappointing .  . rhinestones feel off right away .  . very cheaply made . 
this is a great game but these amazon sellers are charging over price for this game . 
it is garbage !  it is a great concept ,  having more volume than other blue tooth units . 
i m not near a electrical outlet most of the time so i decided to give this battery a shot . 
now movies based on video games about all of them just suc k . 
you would be better off buying bh cosmetics num_num palette for the same price . 
still ,  you ll lose more than a few lives due to bad camera angles in super mario num_extend
as far as results ,  i cant really say i noticed it doing anything . 
my skin was less oily ,  not as shiny and the product was absorbed much more quickly . 
saw accolades and recommendations for this game ,  so i bought it . 
i m not terribly impressed with this product considering what i spent for it . 
the heat regulator has a button that is not very solid . 
after just a couple of weeks it stopped working . 
it may work better on older paints  but i doubt it  . 
if you re looking for a drum ,  buy a drum . 
i call both of these i b annoyed . 
this imho is not intuitive or easy to use . 
thought it would be more trendy but it looks like something my mom would carry . 
it is fairly compact and it s  refreshing  not to see all the various cords all over my kitchen counter . 
the mount is spring loaded and almost at its maxium when placing the num_extend in . 
my dog hated it and couldn t even walk straight after wearing it . 
if you have an external modem ,  you can plug that into the smc for your connectivity . 
you re still randomly crushing buttons hoping something works . 
i installed the drivers ,  then plugged in the unit . 
the smell right now is making it unusable . 
very disappointed that num_num out of num_num times amazon flop . 
thermoworks is right on at boiling water and at an ice bath of water . 
for some reason ,  this product will break after num_num use in a game boy advance . 
it is chunky and gritty ,  very difficult to spread ,  and surprisingly not very flavorful . 
not like our old heavy duty sit n spin . 
now ,  let me tell you :  i m not one to troll nintendo . 
this works on counter or maybe with the flat cake board . 
even though it s working beautifully now ,  i m just not sure it was worth it . 
amazon now charges tax and so now we see the end of an era . 
first thing i noticed is there is not a nice aroma coming from my cup . 
of course i had already bought another from a different company ,  and they wouldn t simply refund the purchase price . 
luckily ,  amazon came to the rescue and is allowing me to return it . 
it partially installed ,  but wouldn t erase and wouldn t run the keyboard or mouse . 
other than this design flaw ,  the headset is a nifty gadget with elegant controls ,  good battery life ,  etc . 
everyone at the office stopped me and complimented me . 
it needs to warm up for about a minute . 
i m sure anything will work better than this avon product . 
the lens certainly has a solid build on all exterior surfaces . 
glad that i sold the game . problem of the game is you can t save ,  only inbetween levels . 
as far as the brush it holds its shape doesn t lose hair and cleanse up easy . 
in battle ,  the voices make you cringe ,  where talking  star ocean :  the num_extend story  sound bite territory here . 
imagine kingdom hearts but a lot slower and with much less variety . 
also ,  i did not notice any skin firming action either . 
you can do a lot better for the price range . 
the ending battle is the worst possibly in video game history . the story is not very good either . 
i am going to buy some heat diffusers and give this griddle another try . 
i m sick of paying good money for junk like this then throwing it away . 
it broke the first time i used it . 
it will even ,  in something i ve never seen before ,  crash in the middle of crashing . 
i have dry ,  brittle nails that peel and i thought with daily use this would improve . 
unfortunately this was a boring and irritating mode to play . 
i purchased this product and it didn t work ,  sent it back to amazon to get replaced . 
i have ordinary sheet pan and this rack does not fit . 
a bag of catfood in the laundry room closet got superinfested with pantry moths . 
motorola chargers have their logo molded into the case ,  this one did not . 
sould you desire a pam substitute ,  simply mix num_num tsp lecithin with num_extend of either grain alcohol or oil . 
the head piece volume was very low and it was a bit uncomfortable in my ear . 
it lives up to all the complaints and negative reviews written on amazon . 
i ve been using cascade gel packs for quite some time and have been happy with those . 
i assumed that the amplifier would improve it so that it would stop that . 
i recently bought it and its very confusing and a hard game to beat . 
went back again to get the credit problem corrected . 
the articles i read on fake products was scary . 
i say stay away ,  but it might be worth the chance . 
i might do num_num arm exercise and change the weights num_num times . 
i think the product may still have a use in your home or office . 
i enjoy popcorn ,  but would rather just have a big bowl of fresh popcorn than these things . 
sadly ,  had to return item as it was too small . 
i for one ,  am tired of being milked . you have been warned !  . 
to be honest ,  i didn t expect much when i ordered this ,  and had purchased it almost on a whim . 
gave it another try afterwards ,  using more primer . 
i bought it so that i could grind my own beans for espresso . 
just keep on walking and get something else . 
i will use a different brand from now on . 
the game is very buggy and feels cheesy . 
though this is an awesome concept ,  it is poorly designed . 
they wrote me and asked me to tell them first before i wrote a review . 
save your money and buy the grass gator num_extend
it smells like cheap perfume so you have to use it very sparingly if at all . 
i cannot recommend this solution under any circumstances . 
my other num_extend setup without leaks works fine all the way to the end of the run . 
one read num_num even ,  the other two read it at a num_extend
these are now relegated to cleaning the windows and wiping down the interior . 
i say all of that ,  so i don t get people flaming me saying i just don t like rpgs . 
for $ you d think the developers would spend a little more time creating quality graphics . 
even though the reviews were terrific ,  i have to say i probably got a lemon . 
i was bathing him once a week ,  sometimes even twice a week using this shampoo . 
to make a long story short ,  our dog completely ignored this dog toy right from the beginning . 
after getting the ants into the frame ,  we noticed that there were several ant  parts  ,  heads ,  legs ,  etc . 
the wooden connector piece that came with it did not fit at all . 
even before mealtime ,  he just walks away ,  not even a sniff . 
i have clear taste sensation; it is my job as a chef . 
i ate a piece ,  then warmed the rest up for about num_num seconds . 
like some earlier positive reviews ,  i like the performance of this player when it s new and working . 
this is the second box of this that we have purchased plus the powder and neither work . 
this item had mostly good reviews but did not work for me . 
then ,  when someone notices ,  the pattern repeats from the beginning . 
i bought this blender to make pie pastry ,  and i was thoroughly disappointed . 
there is not a reset button or any batteries to change . 
for the amount of money they cost ,  they should be designed in such a way that they fit effortlessly . 
it refuses to start brewing so i presume the  brain  has failed . 
it s very sensitive ,  leaving no room for mistakes . 
so ,  it may just be too much for me . 
the design concept is great  has shade ,  folds ,  and has storage  . 
you don t even get what you pay for . 
i am sorry but there is no excuse for electronics without moving parts to be so fragile . 
decided i would try this due to my allergies ,  asthma ,  eczema and sensitive skin . 
even if you don t ,  the num_extend is otherwise seriously flawed . 
i tried this for a week ,  thinking i must be missing something given the great reviews . 
every package i have opened so far has been nothing but crumbs . 
i mean the suction doesn t suck very well . 
could had a little more room in the rear . 
he loved it at first ,  but it moves all on its own . 
it is too small for the phone ,  almost appears as if it was made for the original galaxy note . 
just dont expect to be able to run lots of apps like you see on the iphone . 
stupid of me to think this would work . 
she is too small for other baby stuff and isnt very cuddly . 
i felt better during the break than when using it . i m sorry this product didn t work for me . 
the peltors didn t have as much gain  volume  . 
save your money for a tca peel you can buy on here . 
after three days they called and said  we can t get it going either . 
it would cost so much to return that i just found the closest trash can . 
this makes it not much fun for him to push . 
it is not organic !  the company website only shows num_num of their many cereal products to be organic . 
i have always trusted that in most cases ,  you pay for what you get . 
at least it didn t cost much to find out i was right . 
some games i have been playing over num_num years ,  because they are still fun . 
presto recommends wiping out the bowl and concentrator with a damp cloth . 
there is nothing on the floor ,  no curtains ,  no furniture ,  no rug ,  just an empty room . 
this product cannot be connected with the cover on . 
i ve tried the other brita pitchers and they all have issues of one sort or another . 
the correct clip for your car is snapped over those two rings . 
trust me ,  learn something from apple about uncompromising design for a specific function . 
i poured half the water out again ,  refilled the bowl at the feeding station and watched . 
based on the reviews of the cups running small ,  i ordered a num_extend
why not use stainless steel stainers in all their units ?  this applies to the num_num cup unit also . 
the plastic screen caused the keys to not be touched . 
i did not like this game at all . 
i ve given most of the cups away to anyone who would take them !  . 
i ll stick with coconut water and pomegranate as two separate drinks ,  not mixed into one weird and indistinguishable flavor . 
and i can t figure out the variables . so it s a crap shoot . 
at the end of the day ,  i think there s some confusion over the target audience for this game . 
so now it works fine however the casing is very very flimsy . 
the sound quality was zero ,  because there was no sound at all . 
this was cute and easy setup but was broken within the month . 
i m going right back to my jumbo revlon heated rollers . 
much more expensive but worth it to avoid another incident like that . 
my advice is to save your money and wait for some better games to come out on xbox . 
each  grade level  consists of nine mini games you ll have to play through . 
yeah the last time i did mushrooms ,  it had a much more profound effect than this garbage . 
i use it on turkey sandwiches and make tuna salad . 
then the edible bone did not seem very safe at all . 
i ordered two of these scarves ,  one in red and one in purple multi . 
i will do my best to answer you in a timely manner . 
this is a neat ,  handy little gadget but it failed to perform to my expectations . 
the beagle likes to chew on the grass . 
this causes many more questions to open up about this product . 
ok ,  so what one may say and i agree . 
doesn t open all the way with the spring assist . 
reasonable quality speaker  not loud enough for my convertible num_extend
i suppose the great review are from people who just got their xbox and were impressed with it . 
i tried plunging ,  the stuff is all over the plunder . 
i actually stopped playing the game at this point and will not give it any more chances . 
this is the first time i ve ever ordered raw mango butter . 
finally ,  after about three hours ,  the rash began to fade and i was able to go to class . 
however ,  this time the crash came a lot quicker . 
it s about half an inch higher than the old one too . 
zeus ate three cups he still acted like he was very ,  very ,  hungry . 
i wish that i had a longer torso . 
the room must be absolutely quiet for anyone to barely hear it . 
that is cheap craftsmanship !  i was all set to buy more but not now . 
i will be looking for another set elsewhere ,  these are simply not that great . 
also the rawhide is made in china .  .  . aren t there any available from the usa . 
the second time i used this i immediately noticed a vomit smell and put num_num and num_num together . 
we even poured out a large puddle of this and she tried to drink it . 
i have removed lots of screens on iphones ,  but this piece is extremely difficult to replace . 
i liked everything about this thermometer except that the numbers washed off !  i will not buy this product again . 
unfortunately ,  the developers or producers were really creative with the truth . first ,  there is nothing even close to num_num characters . 
updated review :  after a year ,  the towel holder s ratchet feature broke . 
long story short ,  if you have issues with aspartame ,  do not get this product !  !  . 
if you want a product that works ,  spend a bit more money for something of quality . 
they really should measure up when cutting before they charge num_num dollars for their product . 
at first ,  i was very happy with this purchase . 
in mmorpg terms swg is a wholey pathetic product . 
also ,  it did not improve signal between floors . 
i used it very little because i have a heavy duty vacuum . 
i would periodically put water in it and try turning it on and nothing ever worked . 
ace combat num_num is not such a game . 
this bottle is very large and will probably be sitting in my supplies cabinet forever . 
try num_extend ran the immersing head in boiling water . 
it looks like they rushed it out to try to get ahead in controller production . 
 though it is a little big to fit comfortably on smaller ears . 
this is an adorable little hedgehog ,  but only to look at . 
if the waterproofing doesn t work well enough ,  i ll remove the grip . 
it is the worst nerf gun i have ever seen . 
the pan warped and i threw it away . 
i returned it and i am getting my refund . 
you won t really run into the other playable characters a lot ,  though . 
the images were too dark ,  even during the day . so i returned and got the second one . 
wait till you ve played the game before you review it . brute force is boring . 
i had been using a pur filter for a long time . 
tricky ,  not ergonomic ,  cheaply made . lid to pot is not removable ,  making cleaning less easy . 
seems that history has repeated itself in making the shift to the num_extend
it s ok for one day but after that it would be a birds  nest . i didn t love the results either . 
this product is a clear counterfeit of the original product . 
the colors are pink ,  green ,  yellow ,  and blue . 
would be nice if they sold this in either a powder or liquid form !  . 
i bought the theratherm because i thought it would be simpler . 
that is why i say the name and description using the term boost ,  is misleading . 
many of the pieces do not fit properly which makes the game too hard to smaller kids . 
i have two cats that like to chew on cardboard ,  paper ,  wood ,  pens ,  pencils . 
i cannot get past the first scene because the main character moves around in real slow motion . 
if you want a kong for a strong chewer ,  this isn t the one to get . 
it didn t look new at all ,  looked like it s been previously used . 
the nikon remote worked a couple of times then it went dead . 
my hair looked nice today ,  so i can t complain about it s shampooing performance . 
i m moving onto one of the other brands . 
accompanying the monotony i described earlier is confusing navigation . 
it doesn t clean my skin ,  it doesn t clear my pores ,  to be totally honest it doesn t really do anything . 
for this reason i love the tangle teaser . 
there is definitely something wrong with this crystallized ginger from sincerely nuts . 
his facial hair is baby fine so i thought this would be a perfect razor to start with . 
go to a jeweler and get it sized for the exact type of ring you are buying . 
the headset charges and the lights function correctly ,  however you cannot hear sound from the speaker what so ever . 
i will try to find it and post the name . 
also ,  you d think the feature of being able to remove this component for cleaning is a good thing . 
it takes too much mixing with other products like sugar and cream to get the desired flavor . 
texture wise ,  its not bad and the dark chocolate is great ,  its those initial first bites where your goin . 
needed to move the target out past num_num yds for that caliber . 
however ,  because it relies on a kind of sifting action ,  it s not so great with solidified liquids . 
our warranty has now expired ,  and we will definitely be buying another brand . 
so yes ,  they really succeeded with the filling . 
when i opened the seal of the straw ,  i found some yellow greasy stuff inside . 
the red and black chalks actually left permanent stains on our num_extend blackboard . 
if it s broken ,  then i have to pay . 
i got to where i don t even wear it anymore just because of that . 
i then plugged it in using the mini usb charger i used when i first received it . 
so if you want a color to look like that ,  you ll have to buy the pencil too . 
if there is not enough to mass to completely fill the bonnet out than forget about it . 
its been over a month that i ve asked for them to resolve this ,  not happening . 
she dropped it and ended up hurting her toes . 
i took my time and researched if this was a good product . 
i do not have sensitive skin ,  so this may help those who have sensitive skin . 
i m seeing more and more cereals with this attribute so that s got to be a very good thing . 
it took me about ten minutes to mount ,  which was great . 
if i hadn t been out of time ,  i d have ordered from amazon  :   . 
the improper fit also causes pain at my achilles tendons . 
clicking sounds were loud and a dead giveaway that the needle touched the disk . 
i know earholes differ greatly from person to person . 
i like dark chocolate that is low in sugar ,  but this didn t have that natural goodness . 
the num_num plastic wire pieces on either side which holds the phone in place does so with friction . 
through a process called hydrolysis ,  the starch is reduced to its basic amino acids . 
been using this for awhile now because i refuse to waste it . 
i just knocked my keyboard drawer off the runners and smashed the cd into little pieces . 
tried taping over part of the eye ,  like instructions said ,  moving it ,  etc . 
the cost is similar to the sonys ,  i just hope that the wiring jacket last longer than sony s . 
it didn t work on my grandson s vtech smile motion game . 
why only provide a few stereotypical ones ?  num_extend developers have done some amazing things with textures and organic objects . 
she has been complaining all winter about her feet getting cold ,  but i couldn t fathom how that was possible . 
this primer is really not worth the money . 
this was one of several gifts purchased for a birthday ,  and a rare exception to my many amazon purchases . 
still ,  at $ it s cheaper than a masseuse . edit :  after num_num months ,  it died . 
it doesn t burn and works well at removing my mascara . 
i wrote a review for sprout house brocolli seeds in num_extend
a jabra freeway bluetooth speakerphone  black ,  retail packaging  . 
but at least with the baby powder ,  your hair won t feel disgusting afterwards . 
the moment it shifts position ,  the noise cancelling stops and my voice sounds fuzzy to callers . 
i do not believe this has any vitamin c so i do not know the cause . 
this product was a little heavy for my skin ,  but it smelled nice . 
these are just terrible tires and flat more than any other tire i ve ever used . 
i am sure someglove would help ,  but this is not what i use them for . 
for two mugs ,  we would have wanted a num_extend but that s not an available choice either . 
the unit is stiff enough so that it can t be widened . 
they include num_num instruction booklets in the cd case that are even difficult to understand . 
and i can t give it away cause it didn t come with a remote . 
save a few bucks and get a tried and true dipole antenna . 
the ultimate swiss has a more watery texture and soaks in and contours and lifts . 
this toy is fun ,  when it stays together . 
my dog shredded each one in about num_num minutes flat . 
maybe it s just the way i m built ,  but i didn t find that they ran large at all . 
the game features the original num_num levels and num_num weapons . 
but i didn t get that good of a shave . 
i cannot believe this product made it to market . 
ladies ,  if you are a brunette looking for something to take your hair lighter ,  do not buy this . 
and they had ups come to my door and pick it up . 
i would have given it a five star but i couldn;t wear them . 
i installed it inside of my doors using the roller and lots of elbow grease . 
sisley in the vitamin c connection . `vitamin c is the world s best natural antibiotic ,  antiviral ,  antitoxin and antihistamine . 
got small spots over a good amount of those cases . 
i drink a lot of water and this is not enough for me . 
this is a very cheap product in cost and quality . 
since past four months ,  the dvd just slowly fizzed to being nonfunctional since two months . 
i cannot even wear these because they are so uncomfortable and unflattering . 
the xbox exclusive games put anything the num_extend or gamecube has done to shame . 
it is a big box ,  which appealed to me and would be good if i liked it . 
bought this on a recommendation and i don t think it worked at all . 
i passed the first test by finding that lilliputian tool . 
the aroma was disgusting  only barely resembled puehr  ,  and i ended up throwing it in the trash . 
but the coils really heat only the area near the front . 
however ,  after trying a few times ,  i was very disappointed . 
levels were pointless your increase was only a slight one . 
i purchased the set of shampoo and conditioner . 
holisitic remedies  acunpuncture included  even though nothing has worked . 
i really wanted this boot to work because it is exactly what i was looking for . 
the cord was well positioned  some products have bulky cords that get in the way  . 
didn t last a week .  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  both of them peeled off . 
unfortunately i didn t realize that there are only two types of graphic cards work this game . 
so ,  i decided to buy a different filter . 
i wasn t comfortable ,  but more importantly the sound quality was poor . 
don t expect the thick ,  long lasting quality that you would have expected from lee num_num years ago . 
if you have any problems label it defective and request a return to amazon . 
i bought this bed on august num_num of last year . 
i would appreciate it but i not gonna cry over not having a new one . play the original . 
product seems to be ok but if you run into any trouble forget about it . 
this would be bad enough on its own ,  but the manual controls are extremely slow and ponderous . 
my son is now a speed demon on this bicycle with training wheels . 
yeah it is a touch screen yeah it is a samsung and android but save your money people . 
two stars cause it is a cute ,  little spoon in its way . 
the one i received is very light weightapparently because of an undersized battery . 
unfortunately i bought $ of it because it was a lower price . 
it does have an adjustment that ranges from fine to coarse ,  but it does next to nothing . 
this color looks nothing like the shared reviewers photos . 
so i will not be ordering anymore in the future . 
or even if i will ever be able to remove them . 
i only used it occasionally ,  so it s not like there was excessive use . 
apparently my body chemistry just loves vanilla or this scent triggers vanilla frosting in my brain . 
i had high hoped for tekken num_num but it dashed my high hopes . 
it gets up to heat properly and does make some pretty curls . 
dogs are color blind ? well all anybody does is throw down a fact or crap card . 
 sniff  another gripe of mine  maybe small to some  is the music and commentary . 
this protector is so dark that i could barely see my screen even in the dark . 
i bought somewhere else and different brands after this purchase . 
the metal that the head attachments is made of is thin ,  cheap and flimsy . 
they are awesome looking ,  cheap ,  and keep great time . 
i m not going to buy this stuff anymore . 
it will see the other phones but no talk to them . 
a battle can last anywhere from num_num minutes to almost an hour . 
it was working great for the first few days and then out of no where my skin reacted awfully . 
don t buy this game until they fix the drm issues . 
it is a shame ,  too ,  because they really were a big hit here . 
i m beginning to believe that it has more conditioner in the bottle than actual hair coloring solution . 
i would caution you to not use this product . 
it does the job and it works with no glitches . 
while these problems certainly don t happen in every game ,  it happens on average every other game . 
yeah just got these and tried these on . 
by forgettng this ,  i had also forgotten to back up all the cheats i created . 
i use it to drian my fish tanks for cleaning but only to get the siphon effect started . 
this seems to have been rushed into production and has quite a few bugs and problems . 
game is horrid . multiplayer is only fun thats because its % game ,  % loling @ how much the game sucks . 
to sum this up ,  the games are more boring than the wii sports . 
it only lasts half as long as the brita filters that braun uses in their coffee makers . 
at all times you will have to do the dishes ,  take out the trash ,  pay bills ,  or whatever . 
if you like a spicy zing ,  try these pretzels ,  they are not horrible . 
it s here that you choose who you like and dislike . 
the balance of the yoyo is off ,  it keeps tilting very quickly  under num_num seconds  . 
i like other free and clear products though . 
after using this product for about a month this product made me break out even more . 
this little thing is made out of plastic . 
as a veteran of the super monkey ball games ,  i had high hopes for smb : bb around system launch time . 
unfortunately ,  i didn t get to use it long enough to see results . 
two sticks with a piece of bike inertube . 
it is incredibly shoddily made and is not even worth the $ price tag . 
ok for num_num bucks but would recommend trying one at a store before buying online . 
the graphics have been polished with detailed textures ,  but the already problematic camera angles have gotten worse . 
the actual body of this case is great .  .  .  . silicone ,  easy to install ,  and an eye catcher with the ears . 
on first use ,  i was able to pull out one eyepiece which included one lens element . 
i installed it ,  and made a  sea  and  castle  theme room for my sims . 
just press one button to start ,  the same button to stop . 
after a month there were a few long lashes ,  completely uneven . 
we took the first flair to a designated repair shop ,  and the mechanic could not determine nor fix it . 
i bought the motorized version of this product . 
it was completely drained in num_extend hours of charging . 
i tried several different ways to dissolve it and none worked . 
i forced myself to eat it for a week . 
i used this for a good num_num months before deciding it doesnt do diddly . 
with this game ,  spyro lost all his attitude . 
actually i thought there was oats in it ,  but it s all in the nuts . 
its a very basic one and would definitely be done up to match the slip better . 
if your child is even slightly picky about tastes just forget it . 
this product contains octocrylene ,  which  can penetrate into the skin where it acts as a photosensitizer . 
the needle that came with it did not work . 
if you re looking for actual sunglasses ,  get real and spend more money . 
if it ever gives me a file listing ,  it won t open the files . 
i never had any problems before except for the barking . 
i went out and paid $ to get the battery replaced and the watch started working . 
the battery life on this thing is pathetic . 
kept gettin error mess on my iphone saying charging device is not compatible . 
i got them from amazon vine and i wouldn t buy them again . 
was a little loose ,  almost never use it ,  give it away to a friend and he was not perfect . 
it looks good for about the first num_num mins ,  then it starts to move across the skin . 
the medium one my kids use in their play kitchen . 
i wouldn t buy it again; would just go to a cobbler . 
you get missions to do ,  but unfortunately ,  every . 
i have since purchased themtm predator shooting restfor about num_num bucks ,  and it seems much more stable . 
i won t buy this brand again ,  they re expensive too !  . 
i ve had these from the store and really liked them . 
i can still color in those books today and they don t fall apart . 
i have had much greater success with this blade . 
but ,  right out of the box it was broken . 
eight times out of ten i get errors and have to reset the darn cuff and start over . 
bought to use in sony num_extend but it won t fit so had to return . 
it s the glass ,  glue ,  a handful of tools and that s it . 
color has a weird red tint in it so its not really a medium brown . 
also my former speaker could not play music from my phone . 
they are pretty convenient ,  the sound quality is meh . 
i am tech savvy and cannot record video from my computer using every codec available . 
a cheap bit of plastic died . to hell will sharp !  . 
this company used to have a better product line with their containers as well . 
one thing we didn t expect :  they used an egg crate type mattress instead of a smooth mattress . 
my eskie s fur made short work of this thing . 
very wide opening ,  slouchy style not for me ,  otherwise good boots . 
so on two different people the shampoo and conditioner did the opposite of what it was supposed to . 
i don t understand how others are rating these as  sturdy  . 
i guess i just like the ones that are crispy rather than chewy . 
the clear collar with the black trim and the num_num plastic snaps is a great collar . 
make no mistake ,  this model does suck down the juice . 
i generally like starbucks coffee ,  and really wanted to like this one . 
doesn t matter how i installed it , i tried everything .  .  . it still comes off . 
instead of two nice curves at the top of the heart ,  it was rather noticeably boxy . 
i had a vornado heater and decided to pickup this delonghi heater because it looked big and powerful . 
i did this and the whole upper third of the case snapped off . 
nope you have to take off the tops ,  peel off the seal ,  etc . 
if my dog hates it i have to hate it too . 
i didn t expect it to last forever ,  but i thought it would last a little longer than it did .

totaly useless and made of cheap plastic not cold steel . 
that time only one cat ate the food ,  but he vomited so much there was blood in it . 
maybe it was my razor ,  but it seems like these blades were dull out of the package . 
i ordered this and it came in just a few days even though it was not prime eligible . 
if you put coins in here good luck in getting them out without undressing . 
my dog tore it to shreds in literally three minutes or so . 
i also noticed that the  best if used by  date was feb . 
i found the kitcheaid at a really good price on amazon ,  but it was refurbished .

take my word for it ,  shredding cabbage with this is a nightmare . 
unfortunately ,  it does not seem to work with macs as advertised . 
cleaning is easy :  let it cool ,  then pour hot water over it and wipe down with some paper towels . 
i ended up buying a different one ,  for less ,  at a drugstore . 
this clearly tells me that this product works flawlessly as a modem ,  but has serious issues as both . 
buy resident evil num_extend its the best one since the original . 
i thought it smelled like motor oil and was too runny to use unless chilled in the fridge first . 
the physics of the rocket have changed and the splash damage has been reduced . 
the bag would separate at the zippers numerous times .

i tried at further distances and it still only worked in % of the tests . 
now ?  i m supposed to squirt some foam into the plant s base . 
it sounds like it didn t line up for anyone . 
the other num_num are so blurry when you look through them that they are useless . 
doesn t work very well if your dog won t chew it . 
i even had others do it for me  thinking maybe i was doing something wrong  ,  but that didn t help . 
it is not like he has a long ,  fluffy coat that takes up room in the hoodie . 
my rottweiler ended up chewing the purple top off . 
purchased this item this july num_num and received it num_num days later . 
if more than one person doesn t like this product then it s no longer a coincidence . 
i recommend ff ix most highly ,  as well as chronocross  very nicely done  ,  the sequel to chronotrigger .

the serum really sucked all of the moisture out of my skin and left me looking a little dessicated . 
i have to say i don t have to look no further !  .

i have two tracks :  a coal sifter figure num_num and the oval starter kit from target . 
a small strip of velcro holds the flap down and underneath is a drawstring pocket .

that rainwater will also fill the inside of the glass to the same level . 
ginger ,  lemon and honey seem a natural flavor combination .

it fit very nicely and also looked nice . 
it was a total waste of my time and my money . 
a few of the slats have a questionable life expectancy and many have numerous splinters . 
but i finally had to throw it away . 
i tried flavored creamers ,  syrups ,  whipped cream ,  cinnamon and nutmeg . 
these spots are now where i see rust forming after each use . 
i suspected it was too good to be true and it meets all the other one star reviews . 
much to our disappointment ,  it wasn t a large ,  beautiful stone like it showed on the box . 
purchased because of all the good reviews and was completely disappointed . 
frustrating ,  too the point that it isn t fun .

i tried a pinch in some tart cherry juice and the taste was really good . 
although ,  someone pack the wrong charger in the package . 
mostly he just likes to chuck them behind the diaper changing table . cons :  tips over ,  boringit falls over very easily . 
i received this shoe polish quickly ,  but it is all dry and crumbly . 
if i could do it over ,  i would ve invested in a different case . 
always worth a try ,  though ,  to see if it works for you !  . 
it frequently loses the internet connection regardless of wired or wireless ,  especially when streaming video . 
it seems the holster was sewn too far into the open end so only my muzzle could be inserted . 
its a very cute case but it doesn t protect the iphone at all . 
it was difficult ,  challenging ,  and you had to really play it to beat it . 
i am still scratching my head trying to understand why . 
i just wanted this on my paintball gun to add to the scenario look . 
unfortunately the protector is so thick that the touchscreen no longer works after the screen is applied . 
i ordered this head with a manfrotto table top tripod . 
 i returned my headphones and was refunded by amazon already ,  so this shouldn t be news to them .   caveat emptor !  . 
it has half the ram of an regular xbox console . 
i really loved the idea of this but it falls way short of actually working . 
netgear knows the problems ,  has acknowledged the problems ,  but still has not fixed the issues . 
try jumping to the side of a rolling turtle and it follows you . 
tasted too sweet like they put honey in it . 
but for the most part it made my just washed face feel dirty . 
with all the waste that we add to the environment daily ,  this type of thing really matters to me .

it seems to pick up every background noise imaginable and amplify it . 
back to ao ,  i also noticed a lot of build up . 
i m gonna have to wash it myself to make it look like the picture . 
this stuff is super sticky and the stickiness doesn t fade away much .

first of all its not one that shown on picture . 
i had to give it to a friend who doesn t mind smelling like a perfume factory . 
my daughter had to have the bendaroos for christmas !  !  it was her must have gift for the year . 
the glass is so thin ,  and the whole unit looks and is so fragile . 
i have since switched to the sporn harnesses and they re great for my pitt and my shepherd mix . 
the first turn off  and again ,  totally different than the shells packet  was the aweful color . 
broadcasters say they want to reserve some volume for certain parts of movies ,  etc .

i gave it away to my sister i ll just stick with cerave sa it s a better lotion . 
dumb !  it smells worse than estee lauder and that grandma stench . 
he really preferred his green toys toolbox instead . 
num_extend or later iphone ,  newest ipads and ipods . 
the problem i have with the game is the very steep jump in the difficulty level half way through . 
was this a different crop ? this pineapple does not taste good and was so hard i could not eat it . 
i had high hopes for this product ,  but if he won t take it ,  he won t take it . 
it actually hurt my throat each time i sipped it . 
had to toss this in the trash after reading it s ingredients . 
its cheap so not to upset but a waste of time indeed . 
i love the concept behind this powder but the taste is way to overpowering to be palatable . 
all attacks are based on one of eight types of chi . 
they are safe but hardly ever actually trapped a mouse . 
they were never very bad ,  but more annoying and constant . 
once again i find myself thrwarted by dr . 
they said they would send me a refurbished unit . 
but the unit s num_extend optical magnification made up for the limited mp s . 
they make you look like you have big ,  protruding ,  hard ,  areolas . 
here a quart of it costs about num_num cents .

a coffee maker must brew above num_num to really hit the sweet spot and produce great coffee . 
i am very happy with the traditional model ,  and am pleased with the customer service that oxo provided . 
don t buy these !  !  i believe they are not a true adidas product . 
you can t fit the battery charger that comes with the camera . 
we have own num_num of these cuisinart coffee pots and they are not worth the aggrevation . 
i don t know today who makes a solid wireless router . 
my issue with the line is the thickness and the braid . 
the tivoli is by far the most attractive . 
took the whole bottle as directed and noticed no difference in terms of pain or function . 
it has rather amusing characters but that s about it . 
nice concept and all but ,  wow !  !  !  !  ,  what horrible execution . won t be buying this again . 
item did not stick very well even after following the instructions . 
i only wish someone had told me years ago .  .  . yes ,  this game is cute and easy to play .

this pan is solid and attractive ,  and i love my other le creuset pots and pans . 
however ,  the base on our red one is metal also  copper apparently  ,  with a plastic bottom . 
at certain times ,  you have to kill groups of ravenous small animals to proceed . 
wish i could give num_num different ratings for this product . 
spend the money on a trainer with a resistance control than on buying replacement tires . 
they don t do the fast unravel thing that strings typically do . 
now there is no focus unless you can slide the eyepieces out just right to simulate the focus action . 
we bought num_num of these and both are the same . 
don t buy unlees you want a pointless game . 
just not one of my fav bras by this company . 
it was supposed to walk me through how to connect and finish up the connection . 
i did not want to waste my money . 
however ,  i couldn t get over the rubbery feel of the cincher ,  and the weird smell that it has . 
it just didnt do much for my hair . 
the thinner aluminum peel is what you need to turn around or removing the pizza from the oven . 
now with unreal tournament num_num you get improved graphics and lots of added features from the original game . 
to be fair ,  driving games usually aren t my cup of tea ,  but this game is a real turd . 
she lays down a changing pad on the kitchne floor and changes her diaper . 
way over priced for the size and amount in the bottle . 
since newer reviews seemed generally positive ,  i thought i would take a shot . 
the positive is it s cheap and it has nice rubber runways on it . 
i also don t see why it gets any praise as an enzyme cleaner . 
this blood pressure monitor is very picky about how it is angled before it will work . 
if you don t have an extension rod or kit ,  this brush is useless .

i actually bought an inexpensive motorcycle cover to fit over my mtb with accessories . 
it s hard to contemplate how much they must have thought about different ways to make the bosses suck . 
i am so completely disgusted with this game . 
look ,  lots of people like lots of different things . 
i pretty much exclusivly play rpgs and i was just totally bored about num_num minutes into this game . 
arrived at my house already broken ,  and i don t want another one cause the poor quality . 
i usually wear a num_num or num_num pant ,  but the four in this just fits oddly on me . 
and to be honest ,  nearly all my music and movies are on the kindle fire hd num_extend
cheap product and the chrome buttons eventually fell out as well . 
fresh ,  fresh ,  fresh and they taste so good . 
not a game worth buying for anything more than half of the original retail price . 
the only thing i liked was playing as hardy boys when nancy drew called them on the phone . 
without fail ,  every time i put something in the bag ,  it rips . 
for something of this price range ,  the smell lasts . 
especially if you have to keep changing the water . 
can t comment on the product as it has never worked to date . 
now i cant bring it back cause its software . 
i tried many times with the same results . 
these pumps should be recalled ! also ,  the connector is a pain .

i got the infamous  code num_extend problem that many others are seeing with this product . 
linksys quality has gone straight downhill since they were bought by cisco . 
i wish i had gone with the scale . 
it was touted for helping one reduce food cravings and for stress relief . 
i guess you get what you pay for . 
the actions that are intended to work on it do not work most of the time . 
and the flavor is beyond description ,  in a bad way . 
the good news about this item is that for the price the lens quality is actually pretty decent . 
the dehydrated bits of apple plumped and the cinnamon flavor was subtle . 
the powder and blush brushes i find to be too small . 
so i picked it up ,  anticipating another captivating adventure . the graphics were ,  indeed all that had been promised . 
thank you ,  chuckit !  for making the medium sized launcher a standard tennis ball size . 
the motor running inside would speed up or slow down or just shut off for no reason . 
considering this is arcade football ,  it s a waste . the soundtrack is ok . 
ok ,  it s a plastic ,  manual ice cream maker . 
i found that the hardest part was not shoveling with the power shovel ,  but dealing with the power cord . 
it says it s herbal ,  but smells a great deal of a cinnamon type spice . 
very heavy ,  hot ,  and way too big .  .  .  .  . did not like so it was returned . 
i find most games are far too difficult for the part time gamer even on the easy setting . 
i could not get past more than half a cookie .

not to mention ,  karen was full of depth . 
the vintage stanleys were truly built to last .

we got this for my daughter this christmas . 
my dad took the first dose of this ,  and he woke up with severe vertigo and vomiting . 
i had to blow it up every few days . also ,  the mushroom top doesn t provide any shade . 
seemed like good ingredients ,  but i couldn t get over he texture . 
the iphone was dropped into the hot tub  by my num_num year old  . 
it does not compare to the other henckels lines which are . 
the game s difficulty should be reasonable for everyone as long as they play through . 
i generally really like bumble and bumble product . 
i will never go back to these high priced razors again . 
there was a greasy film and dirt all over both surfaces of both filters . 
i cant put my finger on it but it seems a bit dry or something . 
that is approximately num_num washings give or take a dozen or so . 
we don t need to poison our pets for our convenience . 
i can t beleive people bought this boring ,  pointless ,  and funless waste of money . 
i am finding that platex bras no longer are comfortable or are their sizes exact . 
when you press the button ,  the thermophore quickly turns hot . 
later that day ,  the eyeliner had completely sweated off . 
you never know exactly what the volume is and can t lower it . 
if you do not fix the screww the flash unit will swival all over the place . 
filler ingredients ,  that are neither fit for beast or beast ,  let alone to be purchased from man . 
the flavor was lacking and the texture was too dense . 
my first time through i played lazily and ended up with a b ranking and num_extend something . 
they should make one smaller for those with short hair . 
this is not small and its does not fit me ,  it feels very cheap too . 
maybe the batch i got isn t sticky enough ?  not recommended . 
will get you bye long enough to order a real case . 
also try garlic ear oil if its bad like my dogs was . 
even if it were good ,  i wouldn t buy this anyway just because of how they treat their customers . 
i had to cut it to make it fit . 
once the bowls become dislodged the hanger arms become weapons to your pet . 
it was like dirt and dust combined and i tasted it in my smoothie . 
all were to me ,  too sweet and too sticky . 
the other worked as usb instead of as ac . 
this was a waste of time and money ,  there was absolutely no difference than when it s not used . 
it is pretty but probably can t wear this to walk all day . 
let s admit first that this stuff doesn t actually taste like sugar . 
that being said i think the brush is crap and this mascara was not worth it . 
basically have to stage the room for vacuuming or be around to watch num_extend
nintendo has shafted me again ,  first with a num_extend that had no third party support . 
it takes nothing more than that . anyway ,  for long time gauntlet fans ,  i think you will be disappointed . 
it might be good for transporting your swimming stuff because air can get in to dry it off . 
i would say it is best for children num_num months to walking . 
this led me to bouts of  oh come on !  !  i just want to play the game !  !  !   . 
was trying to decide between seidio ,  ballistic and otterbox after much research . 
i don t think i would buy it again . 
doesn t quite fit well on any pan and makes for wasted space . 
the trouble was we received a dozen or so k cups with no lids . 
in fact i returned this and got a bron which is the original mandoline maker . 
when playing against another player ,  the game simulates reality very well . 
she has the samsung galaxy num_extend but she has tmobile ,  does that matter ?  . 
 this product is super cheap ,  you get what you pay for . 
i have several calphalon pots and will continue to buy them . 
i also had problems with them staying connected . 
what is that about ?  anyway .  .  . the cups were a little small . 
this is the skin care purchase i have ever num_extend
i noticed that another reviewer mentioned this particular problem ,  so i don t think it s unusual . 
i learned my lesson and looked specifically for the all metal topper . 
the item was solidly built however it did not work on my honda crv . 
my big issue is that there are no pockets  wtf ?  !   and the elastic on the bottom is incredibly tight . 
the unit is constantly drawing num_extend as long as there are internal batteries inserted . 
those of us concerned with such things as human rights and the american economy are concerned about such omissions . 
i m pretty sure it s a failure due to the connection at the ear peace . 
of course it fell on the only unprotected spot of the case ,  the top corner ,  onto pavement . 
this helped the bass problem ,  but no there was no mids or  warmth  in the sound . 
i feel like i am filing this thing down every time i try and press something . 
i purchsed this because it said new condition but it was a mess . 
i added more mix to make it less sticky but it just never rolled out correctly . 
  .  .  .  .  any team can become the champs of all the teams . 
while the idea of the soft material is good ,  if it doesn t last i can t really recommend this item . 
but that area also has a haysplosion to clean up each time it is refilled . 
i tried one of the noodles but i could not get around the chewy texture . 
or ,  freaking out and injuring itself thinking it is getting stuck . 
so far i haven t gotten a single one on . 
i am newly natural after cutting off my relaxed ends almost num_num months ago . 
i purchaced this on sale ,  thinking that kitchenaid was synonymous with quality . 
there are metal rings to fasten a shoulder strap ,  but no strap was included . 
i recommend buying the waterproof pencil that anastasia makes . 
i will never buy another product made by schwinn . 
and the older kids fight over the one contour seat big enough and comfortable enough for adults . 
they exploited the  star wars  name to make a buck . 
we have a zoji rice cooker ,  a small capacity coffee maker ,  and a num_num lb . 
only get this game if it is the only game you can find when you are buying a num_extend
i didnt like this at all and neither did my husband . 
they are some of the worst graphics ever seen on playstation num_extend
and no ,  you can t return it if it s been used . 
at times ,  you will feel like your actually playing a cartoon . 
but for a poor college student num_num bucks is a little bit much for a defective can of spray . 
i ve done a before and after recording and what i can say is that there is no noticeable improvement . 
today had to change it to num_num star as it simply stopped working .

i have a dog under num_num lbs and she could almost sit inside this bowl . 
then i returned it for a large .  .  . they didn t work either . 
this tank top runs small and short !  it was also of very poor quality ,  the seams ripped very easily . 
they are olives ,  why are they in vegetable oil ?  and vegetable oil usually means rapeseed oil . 
there is a very ,  very common charging port issue with this phone . 
i will look for something stronger ,  and will buy in person !  . 
play xenosaga  another innovative game  ,  or  . hack ,  or even final fantasy x for the nth time . 
i thought i would get used to it ,  but i didn t . 
there are also no instructions or hint of how to put in the batteries . 
it only gets num_num stars for fun because honestly . 
both fit well through the shoulders but were baggy through the middle ,  thus not supportive ,  even in late term . 
the bath tub did my num_num year old even care . 
i would have paid a dollar or two more for metal ,  or at least hard plastic ,  buttons . 
maybe if you have a very large completely circular wok it may be functional  i dont know  . 
worked fine then experienced extremely slow internet connections and constant rebuffering quitting  with itunes streams . 
their products are second class and their customer service is slow and unaccommodating . 
i use chuckit !  balls to play fetch in my backyard . 
the only saving grace is that it wears off quickly . 
its not a bad smell just not vanilla . 
at this point i was leery and wanted to send it back unopened . 
i bought these on midwayusa for $ each ,  thats two for the price of one listed here . 
what a disappointment !  this is the weirdest toy i have ever purchased . 
the nutrition is acceptable in this drink ,  but the sweet ,  thick chalkiness made it hard to choke down . 
my entire living room reeks of dog urine now . 
if you re still in middle school you might like it . 
probably won t be ordering these in the future . 
hard to lock ,  easy to defeat . i like the mount ,  personally . 
a whole amo belt worth of heavy fire . 
but they will charge you a % restocking fee and ups shipping costs . 
you see ,  it doesn t stop automatically ,  or ever ,  apparently . 
the gel wasn t lathering ,  and it didn t have the slippery quality that it used to have . 
it doesn t give your foot enough of an angle to help with heel pain . 
the size of the keys themselves were not too large  min . 
no big deal ,  i just reinforced the sewing and it has been fine since . 
i tried just not pulling them up as far ,  but then they rolled down . 
if it fail the only message is connection failed try latter . 
so ,  it took me a while to get used to it wearing to bed . 
i am looking for a nursing bra with extra support . 
they also contain anise and they taste much more of anise than of licorice . 
the problem is two fold ,  one they come out soggy . 
this gadget has a large plastic wheel inside attached to the handle . 
i wrote the company , and they sent me a new one . 
amazon says i have to give at least a star here .  . actually i give it zero stars . 
i was so hopeful that this would work for me . 
this is not recommended for much of anything . 
this soup would be better described as creamy potato soup . 
i couldn t figure out what on earth was causing this . 
no sugar added and whole grain .  . not any more . 
this is not to be taken as a positive . 
the price is fair for this quality of feeder . 
if you re serious about games ,  find an import controller made by another company . 
the controls were clunky and the limited variation in the soundtrack didn t help much . 
the nose hair trimmer only lasted two month . 
was working fine ,  then it popped off the windshield ,  hit the plastic center console ,  and cracked in half . 
this isn t at all what i was expecting . 
i started using xtreme brite soap and cream to fix my facial skin pigment and underarms . 
to top it off ,  it does not  brighten  or even out my skin tone at all . 
maybe we got a bad batch or bag . 
i have a clothes steamer that boils and steams in num_num seconds with no salt . 
anyway ,  it looks like many other people love this scent so i don t want to discourage a potential buyer . 
i made this with a few ounces of steamed milk ,  water ,  and a little heavy cream . 
sure this game is kinda fun if you re into the movie but really not all that great . 
i thought perhaps if i used them when i wasn t jogging that they wouldn t be so uncomfortable . 
see if they have various reviews ,  not just zico raves . 
however they do not tell you the varying size difference . 
if you want a flavor other than apple ,  try the tangerine . 
the outer shell is smooth lycra . the next step was to give the garment a test run . 
if not super careful ,  a primer will get shoved in upside down . 
this is the first calphalon pan i have purchased . 
as well bought another one recently and when this arrived the product was not working . 
this one looked just like the one i wanted to replace . 
comparable to an otter box my butt !  it s made of like num_num cent plastic . 
i bought the whole case with the intention of enjoying some myself and giving some as presents . 
i wouldn t recommend anyone to buy this item . 
its almost as if your watching an anime movie ,  except there are a few playable parts . 
it makes it better but still very reminiscent of a meteorite . 
first time i used it ,  it was good . 
when i got home to use one i realized why they were on sale . 
you will end up packing more air into your sausage casings than meat . 
i ve played with it and the backing is tight and tough . 
i was suggested to buy this for landscape photography . 
i would put some more $ in a better case . 
why can t there be a good timer in the $ range ?  . 
don t throw away your money like i did . 
you will not get a proper fit and amazon has not handled my complaint in an upstanding way whatsoever . 
i have an num_num month old golden retriever . 
collecting weapons and  heroes  ,  only serve to give you attack points or buying points . 
my daughter was so excited when she saw this gift . 
get it right square ,  or i will never be able to forgive you . 
this filter num_extend circular polarizer  is so minimalist it barely has enough threads to fasten to my camera . 
first of all ,  like one of the other reviewers said ,  they don t fit on the pencils properly . 
it is big and bulky num_extend plus pounds  . we really need something compact and easy to transport . 
there is no way you can buy a $ brush and have it feel like a $ one . 
it also got between the scoopfree box and our bamboo floor and scratched it . 
she was so uncomfortable that we bought her a new float with a better seat . 
i bought this product while i was on vacation  i had forgotten my regular spf moisturizer  . 
from the brittle hard texture to the strange after taste ,  this tuna was disappointing . 
i am just returning my third rio karma in seven weeks . 
zipper broke within a year of owning pillow case . 
now it doesn t work with the original battery . 
to replace it ,  i found a great deal on a jabra num_extend
apparently i m exactly the sort of person that gearbox hates . 
why would i want to replace it when it fell apart at the seams on the first use . 
the first one just chip off on one of the edges after several weeks . 
we ve had this mouse trap in a problem mouse area at our front entryway for several weeks now . 
note :  i took several photos to account for human error and took the best photo from each series . 
the chrono tag is merely a means to an end ,  however ,  it is there to sell the game . 
this leaves me having to put it on towards the bottom so that it doesn t cover my speaker . 
 .  .  . i haven t used my garmin in over two years since i bought my first droid . 
strangle mice ?  aren t we past this level of revenge ?  finally ,  the trap is not robust in its construction . 
then i managed to break it ,  so i ordered another one in march of this year . 
i have a golden retriever that does like to chew ,  moreso then any other dog i ve owned . 
as soon as i poured it into the litter pan a cloud of dust puffed out in my face . 
although the game has many difficulty levels ,  there are not smooth gradations between them . 
i am giving it one more shot today . 
pick size ,  pick width ,  pick color and material ,  but no options regarding the footbed . 
cold steel is a decent company but their chinese made products are getting worse . 
this makes the best steamed food ever ,  but it s a bit cumbersome for everyday . 
short choppy hair that needs a lot of help . 
just broke i have very little words for how upset i am . 
these are okay for listening to speech  as opposed to music  in a quiet environment . 
if you are buying one of the larger traps these things come in very handy . 
but my major complaint is the peeling teflon . 
i then replaced the cf card ,  and that worked for about num_num weeks . 
however ,  the indicators that show if an alarm is set do not dim ,  and they can be astonishingly bright . 
i know it is spendy ,  and accessories add up  but that is what christmas is for ,  right ?   . 
i could have returned it to amazon ,  but the shipping costs would have been more than the refund . 
and yea the game has a high replay value . 
the product had another type of smell which was like wet wool and not very pleasant . 
i am talking about scanning the short wave signals . 
these chargers do not fit or meet my requirement as ordered . 
i dont see any reason why this particular product needs to be purchased . 
it s kind of like greasy ,  salty peanut butter . 
this was the first echinacea brand that i tried and i was not impressed . 
i see now from reading negative reviews that many others have experienced the very same problem . 
however ,  that is not what i was looking for . i much prefer the black cherry over the other two . 
this is an excellent product and doesn t need any additional ingredients . 
the second bulge is noticeable at num_num mm ,  but only if there was no warmup beforehand . 
there s no way i d even think of dragging an animal with it . 
the home one was thrown out in a few months due to poor plasticy taste . 
bought this about num_num years ago from another site  much more expensive  . 
it took less than a month for the clip to break without much use . 
i took it for days but it didn t touch my low back pain . 
i don t know how anyone with a thicker mattress could do it . 
no telling how long this thing sat on the shelf before it was sent to me . 
that might be biased on my part because ,  i read reviews that compared them to real life . 
i don t care how calorie free it is . 
however ,  she will use the eggserciser ,  which i think is a better product . 
their are no create a wrestler options ,  no season modes ,  limited choices in wrestlers . control get screwed up at times . 
its gettin num_num stars because it doesnt fit very well . 
it is so tiny ,  i can t believe they charge that much for it . 
i could not imagine what will happen if kids just use it to drink . 
also ,  i wore a petticoat underneath it to help fluff it up since the under lace is pretty minimal . 
i am not ordering large amounts of anything from amazon again . 
it worked well for num_num month and then just stopped working . 
it is attached to the bottom by firm latches . 
it gave my undereyes a terrible gray cast ,  which only made my bags look worse . 
but getting back on topic ,  the game isnt fun . 
i should have checked into the nutritional information before ordering . 
i had never tried a lemon ginger drink before and didn t entirely know what to expect . 
the thing is super cheap light weight plastic ,  think dollar store quality  but you are paying far ,  far more  . 
have used product well over num_num times with nothing . 
i played this game on my friend s xbox num_num and loved it . 
this is a plastic water reservoir and tray designed to provide liquid refreshment for wild birds . 
if your a smart comsumer then you know what to purchase . 
returned it just didn t meet the requirements we had . 
why ?  money grubbing is one of the ways i would explain it . 
i used to use this one product as a foundation and under eye concealer . 
i called xbox support last night and was talking to them about a problem i had . 
we only used this blender to make drinks . 
a few days later the spring fell out completely while riding and the bell is silent . 
this smells great but it is not the original . 
she even has a diaper bag for this doll . 
these are just way too expensive for what it is . 
i used this product  correctly  as another reviewer outlined and still got poor results . 
the graphics weren t great and overall ,  it just wasn t good enough to be a good game . 
they are constantly looking for new ways to increase the cost of shaving . 
i tried this cleaner ,  and it did nothing for the stain . 
and follow fisher price s caution of having it above a soft surface  eg chipbark or something  . 
unless you re a masochist this game is not for you . 
i am trying to return product cause i am very disappointing and this product does nothing it says . 
and then it started smoking from the num_extend
it is very forgiving on cook time so it would be hard to ruin anything cooked in it . 
i bought the nasaflo from my local walgreens . 
maybe internal charger is failed ,  red light flicker continues . 
maybe i just received a bad one but i have never had one this bad . 
even an adult would have trouble ,  as i did . 
lastly ,  they started putting malodextrin in their cereal .  .  . obviously not a whole grain nor a naturally derived sweetener . 
i ordered it used and it came on time and i had no problem with the cd during gameplay . 
additionally ,  i like for the spray to have a nice smell especially since i m using it on synthetic hair . 
this case has a very ,  very strong chemical smell . 
we put this on the fence between us and it did nothing .  .  . at any setting .  .  . with mutliple batteries just in case . 
your mileage may vary ,  but for me ,  this stuff is pain in a bottle . 
it clearly says in the attached little card  hand wash only ,  washing in dishwasher will discolor the item  . 
i tried this product because i wanted something that was not pricy . 
im not sure if i got a faulty product ,  but this didn t work at all . 
the spotter i love that he always give you information on where you are . 
we made several attempts in familiar surroundings and the barking persisted no matter what . 
there is a reason why they are so inexpensive . 
i bought this one based on the amazon reviews; this is the one time they failed me . 
they are ,  or they aren t . fast forward approximately two weeks . 
i was pretty excited when i got this straightener . 
this takes a while with this product . upon cooking it ,  it has a rather harsh ,  unpleasant quality . 
but years ago i bought a far superior ,  far better set for $ that was worth the money . 
i sampled it black to get the true flavor . 
since even good old arnold had trouble seeing him in the movie . with all of that said ,  who needs combos ?  . 
i ll keep looking for a better inflatable bouncer or a trampoline . 
some of them light up well but for the most part ,  they are cheap for a reason . 
i gained some weight and needed new bras and have usually trusted bali in the past . 
if only i had seen these reviews prior to making this purchase . 
give this to your little girl to play dress up in ,  because you can not take this product seriously . 
this game doesn t make it past unsatisfactory ,  not by a long shot . 
so if want turn off the phone press the button then touch  slide  . 
hard to disconnect and had a faulty connection . 
it is loud on anything other than the lowest setting . 
they are made in thailand and i am convinced these are fake . 
the palm v and vx were never cool enough to overcome that stigma for me . 
it also makes the phone kind of bulky . 
spend a little more ,  get a lot more . 
when i run out of these i will be looking for somethingin capsul form not tablet . 
i purchased this mighty mite to replace one i had over num_num years . 
i bought this clipper because i wanted something that was a little quiet . 
then about two hours in goes in a different direction . 
i would not recommend this for anyone who is buying this toprevent getting bit !  ouch !  . 
none of their products are the same as they were num_num years ago . 
you d be better off using a spoon or spatula . 
all to often ,  trying to press one button ,  i d wind up pressing another at the same time . 
you d better off just wait and have patience and costs no money that way . 
if i could use the vacuum it might have received num_num stars but now ?  . 
screen protectors may seem a good idea to use ,  but i think it s not worth it . 
and the lashes look too much like plastic . 
my brother is an engineer and was unable to find the problem . 
after just a week ,  he had chewed open the giraffe s head and pulled out the stuffing and the squeaker . 
not safe in my opinion !  if you already own this board please be careful !  . 
don t waste your time on it until they fix all the bugs . 
we tried this for our gerbil clan ,  but our gerbils never figured it out . 
put it on like instructions said and the cloudiness never went away . 
continuous reminders to upload and download things you already selected not to do . 
unknowing owners are feeding this potential killer to their loved pets . 
remember to remove the receiver case after charging as it is not recommended for daily use . 
i will just by the recommended case for this phone . 
tattoine for example is blinding bright ,  and dathomir is pitch black . 
yes ,  i did thread his collar through it and no ,  i did not have it too tight . 
sure enough ,  they didn t discontinue these ,  but ,  they did change them . 
why ?  because it s basically the same as gta iii ,  vice city and san andreas . 
mint is fine on its own and delicious with chocolate . 
well ,  it is not like what i imagined at all . 
i played the first halo and didn t really care for it . 
the graphics are decent ,  but they just can t match the old contra from the nes . 
no one needs their products ,  they are unfit for consumption by animals and humans . 
after about a month of sleeping on it ,  one of the baffles ruptured and i had to return it . 
i got to use it for a month . 
it looks cute but is just awful ,  would charge but wouldn t last . 
right now he will take the rings off ,  throw them ,  then moves on to something else . 
i purchased both in november num_num and by january num_extend it stopped working . 
the markers themselves come in a nice variety of colors but they dry out quickly . 
i am not afraid of intense ,  but they were just off . 
bought this to keep him from doing it . 
i am disappointed ,  but it may not be the fault of the product ,  per se . 
tried one on ,  and was quite surprised when it simply was too small for my foot . 
i have never seen such a useless unstable stand in my life . 
as someone else stated ,  it s hard to get the dustbuster back into the upright . 
sounds pretty simple right ?  ok ,  now imagine that you can only move a few footsteps at a time . 
we shouldn t have to be a genius to play a fighting game . 
using it would only be torture to any creature . 
i purchased these shoes after i came down with plantar fasciitis in one heel . 
it looks very durable ,  but noticeably colored the sound with a loss of treble . 
as a bodybuilder ,  i like to keep a  clean  look . 
and a day passed and my copy was back on the store shelf . 
turn it off !  these are being presented like they are your problems or norton s or zone alarm . 
i quit messing with it after the first day and will buy something more robust to replace it . 
it held his interest for about num_num minutes . 
since that was the only reason i bought it ,  it is useless to me . 
please ignore all these one star reviews that nintendo nuts are giving the psp . 
now ,  the most recent time i got it back ,  the battery in the mouse was dead . 
one flaw in the system is the battery life . 
i never take it off the phone either ,  never have . 
this case feels awful pulling the phone out of your pants pocket . 
no blueberries to be found ,  they use blueberry concentrate to create a skittle like nodule . 
have a different linksys router ?  forget about it . 
i tried each of them out before i put them in my grandchildrens  stockings . 
probably just my dog but it made her more itchy . 
as others have said ,  the extenders are flimsy and slip when you re trying to cut on the board . 
i feed a lot of hummers !  by the way ,  you don t need artificially colored purchased nectar . 
this was simply unacceptable ,  so i immediately returned it . 
the bone and bowl were two of the reasons i chose this set over others . 
perhaps my skin just disliked something in the bar . 
and i was still having to pick up hot ,  unpopped kernels and throw them back in . 
it is nice and i suspect cost more to make than the glasses . 
since dollar tree stores like to swap up inventory ,  you can also find this at target for $
i was hesitant to force the plug into the socket for fear of damage to the phone . 
bio oil would work just as well as is a whole lot cheaper . 
i bought this today and set it up . 
i am pregnant and have had a lot of trouble with bleeding gums . 
or i can carry a sniper rifle and a machine gun !  an awesome combo ! the graphics are ok . 
it was either that one or this one ,  i never received . 
it says num_num pack but i only got one . 
what i do care about is the taste of said coffee . 
it does boil water so it worked  until the handle broke  . 
ordered this for my num_num month old dog . 
so i browsed amazon and bought it for $
she doesnt like the color so i ended up with it . 
the batteries did not stay together so they kept losing connection which would reset the timers . 
if so ,  i will revise my review accordingly . 
i think the sound of running water actually frightened her . 
you get what you pay for ,  and i recommend you pay a little extra for another wireless brand . 
although i think they do work the effect is very subtle and i need something a bit stronger . 
onward to remove the batteries  for num_num minutes to allow reset .   . 
looks like a good one if you can figure it out . 
it worked ok for her . did not do much for me . 
i recently purchased this style as a possible replacement to my favorite discontinued barely there bra . 
but it s what dependable and reliable company produces despite the price . 
i ve heard a number of people say they were too wasy; that wasn t my experience . 
don t order this item unless you want to pay twice as much as for a set of philips num_extend
the first time i used it ,  i noticed that it made me smell  burnt  after i got out . 
the box kept the phone from dying ,  but wouldn t actually deliver a decent charge . 
we received purple which is annoying but doesn t affect the product . 
my dog isn t interested in this at all and its it heavy and annoying for my cat to enjoy . 
they last a long time and are always the same product because they are branded and packaged . 
this was so disappointing ,  especially because it more than $
i was very excited when i found it online but after i reviewed it i am very disappointed . 
i will not get this product next time . 
i could feel it as i laid down the foil . 
so far ,  some of the chocolate is ok . 
the delivery guy handed off the box to me . 
and ,  num_num times was disappointed and left frustrated and angry that i couldn t get anyone to filful my order . 
i tried various method to get it to work and found my effort not futile . 
i have owned the num_extend htc touch num_extend htc num_extend nokia num_extend nokia num_extend nokia num_extend and apple iphone . 
not what i hoped for .  .  . but it looks pretty . 
granted the cord is num_extend long but i don t need even a num_extend cord . 
over a few weeks time ,  the right side went completey out . 
to this day ,  i am still full of disappointment . visually and in theory this game was a great idea . 
what i got is num_num ft thi ,  not the num_num footer that i ordered . 
the volume and power buttons aren t open ,  but have an integrated button into the side . 
it seems to evoke the familiar memories of mom s raspy tongue . 
everything im about to say concerning postal num_extend you ve probably already read . 
feel awful even if top wasn t was stretchable . 
i should have know based on the smell . 
and the pocket is not well formed and does not capture the ammo well . 
there s something like a total of num_num vehicles however they re not all playable . 
i hope the fix it soon or i will order a different brand . 
i m much prefer to get a darker ,  bolder blend and use the middle water setting . 
tank temp in wisconsin winter fell to num_num degrees over night . 
but i just can t get past the taste . 
the rhinestones looked very cheap as well and were very stiff . 
it doesn t appear fixable  i think the bail has bent  . 
i called briggs medical supply and they were totally unsympathetic . 
mostly it was just mediocre and difficult to use . 
the bottom of the shoes were bowed and therefore lacking in support on the ball of the foot . 
i would never buy another tweezerman s brush ever . 
i should of read the reviews before i bought it . 
i have never had an experience like this . 
received these pens ,  they dont even have the same writing on them as they do in this picture . 
this game is the winner of the worst navigation plan ever conceived . 
i got my money refunded  thank s amazon !   ,  and bought kenwoods instead ,  no problems . 
i don t know what the price is now ,  but it was a complete bargain . 
apply gentle pressure to the throttle to lift from the num_extend
but ,  a big part of a company is to stand behind their products . 
i ll pump it on my top lashes for a good num_num seconds ,  and my eyelashes stay put . 
i have made lots of spaghetti over the years and this one was the worst . 
and ,  fyi ,  i thoroughly followed the directions ,  and used fresh ,  lean hamburger purchased only an hour before . 
ordered this along with a heavy metal stockpot . 
whenever i continue on to the second one ,  i always regret it . 
there are no ears ,  tracheas ,  pizzles ,  tendons ,  or even hooves in this bag . 
case is very cheaply build with flimsy hinges and clasps that are equally cheap and falls off easily . 
the mute button does not align with opening ,  which forms a bulge on the side . 
i ll admit ,  the game can be a little fun at times . 
i simply couldn t get this to work most of the time . 
i should mentioned that i actually received four screen protectors in my num_num pack . 
it was better to just make it with yarn . 
our staffordshire terrier was highly allergic to the supplement and had to immediately be taken off it . 
swg should not be turned into something it isn t . 
buy the filters in num_num packs or more ,  which greatly reduces the price . 
even when i use only a pea size amount of this conditioner ,  it makes my hair limp and flat . 
i let the grandkids each pick out an inflatable pool toy and one chose this one . 
a shame if not ,  since otherwise i m quite happy . 
instead it tears ,  and comes off in tiny bits . 
i am not too enthused about this product . 
amazon sold this and sells the shampoos also i believe . 
the headband and ear pieces do not fit especially well . 
i had problems getting the sticky stuff put . 
first ,  the action factor is actually a little on the slow side . 
i order a women s num_extend and they sent me a size num_extend which was way too large . 
i m going back to my trusted neoteric alpha hydrox . 
removing algae is little more than a side benefit . 
unfortunately ,  i think they simply made the game too hard . 
it ll destroy your brain and erase all of your known gaming abilities for other games . 
i bought another brush from this maker and thought that was what i was buying again . 
the levels themselves are terrible as well ,  filled with glitches and the fact that superman is super weak . 
just :  go from a to b to c to d . 
maybe i didn t know this but novelty is code for junk . 
this is one item i d leave out of any bug out bag or survival kit . 
they buy meat from one of the largest makers of dog food in china ,  a massive factory . 
now we just use it on the side . 
it s not what i expected and it is to small . 
these ones do the job and are easy to use . 
i used this food with one cat for five years and figured she was just a puker . 
if they would fix the noise issues ,  i might have even kept it . 
there are only num_num good things about this game . 
it works sometimes and doesn t num_num seconds later . 
sorry to be the only one here who didn t pick up interest in this one . 
plugging it into the charger ,  the indicator leds would not illuminate . 
there are rhombuses ,  paralellograms ,  pentagons ,  hectagons ,  and octogons . 
the other five bags will be given away to unsuspecting family members . 
there s a balance established between strong weapons and strong enemies . 
qbs breaking tackles from lbs who outweight them by num_num pounds . 
the idea behind this product is very good but the implementation is not so . 
great if you like doing stupid tasks in a tony hawk style manner . 
some games look like traditional computer games  like climbing a wall  ,  but you have to click phoenems . 
the person in the picture must be wearing an xs  ?  ?  . 
but i really don t like the feeling of moisture along with the warmth . 
this bar tastes ok ,  but definitely not what i was expecting from a  dark chocolate  bar . 
not recommended ,  this is not what is pictured and is not a genuine samsung battery . 
i knew in my gut that if cooks illustrated endorsed these ,  there had to be something wrong . 
as mentioned in other reviews ,  this is not for cars and trucks . 
i have two older computers on my home network running windows xp that have ide . 
this company does not lose market share because of lack of interested buyers ,  willing to pay for american products . 
the drafting pretty much tweaks the usual tired  multiple paths to victory  eurogame mechanic . 
channeling my inner johnny depp ,  i decided to go in for the kill . 
it did everything as it was said it could do . 
they also didn t come together perfectly nor did they feel too sturdy although i didn t really test them . 
every battle seemed to be the same ,  and it was all too easy . 
ok not only is the movie bad but the game is too . 
it s a pain to take out and put back in; wheather you use it for water or dry food . 
it s not the most expensive brand nor is it the exotic nature of the coffee that is my snobbery . 
this is based on a study of emulsified fish oil ,  not this product specifically . 
and the tank will not be hanging from the gun . 
it stands among my otherwise proud collection ,  a sad sign of good intentions scarred by poor execution . 
the flavor was very good but they were very hard ,  even in milk . 
put the two together and for sure i thought i had a winner here . 
i played spore on my friend s computer for about an hour . 
a smaller reservoir that didn t spill so easily would be a better idea . 
there is no manual on their website for it . 
my riding buddies are always telling me how noisy it is even after i had recently lubed . 
why is this company being allowed to lie about the sugars in their product . 
i love image skincare but i don t love the vital c line . 
after several days we began to notice a pretty severe blade wobble . 
it is cumbersome when assembled ,  tippy ,  and doesn t work like it s supposed to . 
we broke it up pretty fast and no one was hurt but it was scary . 
i could redesign these linkage bars to work ,  but they d likely cost a penny more . 
until you take the negatives of num_extend into account . 
i am very acne prone ,  yet have annoyingly dry skin as well . 
none came with the foam that it said it should have had included . 
i can see how hard it would be for someone to actually create a brand new character like say . 
the product has great reviews !  first usage was fine ,  nothing special except for the strange smell and taste . 
this organizer is basically a big pocket with two mesh document holders . 
the extra large do not fit my num_num lb slim black lab . 
i have used this product ,  but no more . 
pack were the size of a real peanut . 
the spray pump is better of course than aerosol . 
don t even bother with a battery unless it is rated num_extend
the phone is secure in it and it stays in place well but the design definitely needs some work . 
i liked the metal mount and the focal length range was good . 
so that means you can rule out purchasing this fiasco forever . 
i found this toaster to be a notable exception . 
my cat wasn t having any of this nonsense . 
but i do like it more than the one i sent back !   :   . 
there are three criteria i can think of for reviewing this kind of product . 
i still use it ,  but have to remove the spots in post . 
kids don t need to play every game ok ?  that is what the esrb ratings system is for . 
i suffered with this unit for about num_num weeks before i caved and returned it . 
the button for answering the phone did not function . 
after reading the one reviewers comments about the contaminants ,  it seems to click for me . 
my other splitter which is $ is much more better than that . 
pretty disappointed because i signed up for a subscribe and save and have num_num bottles of this stuff . 
even on the thickest ratio ,  car soap does spray out but it doesn t cling to the paint . 
it gets into the eye perfectly and it it has good resistence when curling and the other dont . 
it was not even worth the $ i paid for it  as of dec num_extend
it doesn t seem to help get the tangles out . 
the only thing that has completely cleared my skin was proactiv and hormonal birth control . 
oh my ,  it was so weak in color and taste . 
they wanted me to ship it back to prove it was expired before they would send me anything . 
i also feel like this works better when you work out . 
it is too heavy and bulky to return but so expensive; i am sad i am stuck with it . 
in the setup wizard ,  i was first prompted to set up an internet connection before using the router . 
now i have to get a new power supply and was told that no one makes this anymore . 
whatever keeps you in the game you know . 
this poncho is absolutely not what i expected . 
the buttons don t pop back out after you deselect them . 
the material seemed very cheap and coarse and it was itchy . 
so that will definitely be my last order . 
this stuff works to get rid of bloating but the taste is horrible . 
my hair was brittle and more dry than it has ever been . 
surprisingly ,  these socks are not very durable and do not warrant the rather steep price that thorlo socks command . 
shakes easily if the legs are not tight secured . 
it will stop bleeding from razor nicks and cuts and won t leave white residue on your face . 
i have an ipod touch which i love and now want an iphone . 
i fixed the problem though by taking a kitchen knife and scraping off the stupid plastic tab . 
the teeny button you push to activate that function is not very reliable . 
the first part of the problem is the inner lid you don t see . 
then a couple months later i decided to try it again thinking maybe it was just a fluke . 
even the new balance store could not figure out what was causing the noise . 
i think my wife kept this for maybe two days . 
when i played back ,  there was one minute of conversation ,  and num_num of . 
they do not provide hookup for external antenna either that could improve some station reception slightly . 
i ve replaced it with the bodyguardz protectors i should have bought in the first place . 
get a transmitter that connects to the bottom  dock connector  of your ipod instead . 
also ,  the programmeable timer options are great . but ,  i had some problems with this machine . 
the game just proceeds from one  scene  to the next . 
all this thing does is smear the dry black gunk that comprises the polishing tip . 
maybe my expectations were wrong because i thought this coconut was awful . 
you fill in the blank ,  because i can t . 
do yourself a favor and spend the same $ on a wireless gamecube controller . 
however none of them work with the energizer charging pad . 
the only plus ?  some of the environments look tolerably like the movie . 
as of this review time it s currently $ from amazon . good luck . 
if i take away her food and leave her with this ball ,  she starves . 
i returned it ,  and ordered num_num more  both for leupold scopes  . 
i just had a fitting and i know my proper size . 
my wife is a devout catholic and this is a slap in the face of catholivcs especially mexicans . 
at this point apple cider vinegar seems like a better treatment . 
i quickly noticed after applying it ,  it left a white residue on my armpits . 
the gameplay is totally lost in no mans land . 
i don t know why but it squeezed all the wrong places . 
immediately i felt like was just looking through any type of clear plastic not plastic designed to be lens . 
the second watch was also defective  .  .  .  . the indiglo light didn t work . 
the battery had worked well for num_num years ,  but this end was a serious fire hazard . 
so ,  now i know better ,  thank goodness !  don t get me wrong ,  tamanu nut oil is terrific . 
plus hh wants an additional seven dollars shipping ? my mom didn t raise a wastrel . 
i have a treated bunion on the right foot ,  and untreated one on the left . 
their shape is a bit awkward and they get caught in my throat . 
do not waste your money like i did . 
the first time i used my first rabbit ,  i was surprized by how easy it was . 
but it can t do me a lot of good if i can t drink it in the first place . 
filed for a return with amazon within num_num mins of opening package and return label printed . 
bought two of these for the summer as i work out and swim a lot . 
i like the idea of this product .  .  .  . but these are by far the worst tasting bars i ve tried . 
i usually by purevia ,  ideal ,  or stevia in the raw .  .  . for the price this seemed like a good deal . 
the marble was very heavy and the handle thin and flimsy . 
lesson learned :  check reviews before buying ,  which i did not ,  i banked on it being good . 
save your money or look elsewhere ,  these headphones are not what you want . 
the problem was that the spring tension of the ear loop was slightly pushing the headset off my ear . 
the jobs have some of the classics ,  as well as some interesting new ones . 
if it had a taste ,  i never tasted it beyond the taste of the salt . 
sadly the squeaker in the hedgebog didn t last long at all . 
asked for an exchange only because it was a gift and had it shipped to the person . 
we tried it on the floor numerous times ,  but it never interested her in the least . 
i hope this can get worked out so that i can feel comfortable purchasing these at amazon s lower price . 
but this is just too much to ask . 
additionally ,  the inside sole is very hard :  i ve had dearforms that cost $ and were more comfortable . 
i m super bummed ,  because the back support felt nice ,  but not worth it when my front looked deformed . 
i was very much attracted to this thin stylish cell phone . 
if you re like me and like hard cases and sparkly things ,  pass this up !  . 
cel damage s engine does num_extend but it looks flat ,  like you are watching a cartoon . 
i ve used other signal booster from wilson electronics for my office and it works very well num_extend only  . 
i bought it for the cheap price and got a cheap item . 
there isn t much you can do with it . 
i ve used this radio for a while now ,  and i ve concluded that it s not very usable . 
i didn t like it ,  so i won t recommend it . 
this number is no where near the num_extend ma num_extend that was advertised . 
it took me num_num different times at attempting to get this completely hooked up before i finally did . 
you could have at least offered an online service like xbox . 
the product is now totally useless after a couple of months of careful use . 
this case fits a mega which is ass hell never again . 
kicks would have added a little more variety to the attacks . you should buy god of war instead . 
no problem; i hadn t thrown our old litter box out ,  so that became his exclusively . 
keep in mind ,  that these are intended for classical or talk radio with a high contrast . 
some of the toys he loved ,  but this one scared him . 
these are probably past their prime without any softness at all . 
not worth buying the strap  can t use non propriety ones  . 
the material is very stiff even after washing with fabric softeners . 
i have tried writing to two different dvd burners ,  neither of which have given me problems in the past . 
it will all be returned as soon as possible . 
the music catalog on the device gets constantly corrupted . 
too much a hassle to send them back . 
i will never buy anything that has that name on it . 
my dogs didn t like it and wouldn t eat it . 
i like having highbeams though ,  so i sent them back . 
especially if you have a large amount of music and especially if it is classical music . 
i had poor performance and poor reliability . replaced this with a motorola surfboard num_extend
the only thing these bags have going for them is that they are kind of hand shaped . 
these are quests that happen on the little island your on . 
all parts are very flimsy , foam pieces has a very strong chemical odor . 
the entire watch movement fell out of the band . 
i purchased the powermax num_num two years ago to use on my standard poodle . 
i waited so excited for this product to arrive . 
a higher torque motor will keep the speed up even in viscous liquids . 
i switched to a motorola oasis and it fit and performed much better . 
neutrogena is a brand i trust ,  but this stuff has more problems than benefits . 
i have now grown it to the middle of my back . 
amazon probably will pay to ship it back if its not satisfactory . 
i do not like the feel of rubber in my hands . 
you can squeeze them flat as they are filled with air . 
i am num_num years old ,  with good flexibility and upper body strength and it s still hard . 
so ,  if you need something that would last for a long time stay away from this product . 
definitely you could not put cans on these as the pictures suggest . 
feels cheap in your hands ,  better off just switching batteries when you need to . 
they did not win any prizes except for our hearts . 
i hit the  tune  button again ,  but no dice . 
total waste of money ,  wish i d bought the next model up . 
if i were you ,  i would only give this a try if it was free . 
nice small size and i loved this grinder for num_num years . 
but if you are on a high protein diet ,  avoiding carbohydrates ,  then beware . 
i don t think it needs to be so tall . 
i rather go back to my wire network . 
assembly was easy and it does look like it would be fun upon assembly . 
i was disappointed in the product packaging itself . 
stopped using the product to see if that could be the cause . day num_extend irritation lessened . 
this is a great no streak self tanner without an orange color . 
the sunbutter jars leaked all over themselves in the box . 
works as advertised but the keys are stiff . 
as mentioned before ,  the quality is so so but since it s kid requested ,  it is what it is . 
i bought this along with an additional battery . 
i will certainly not be replacing this mixer  when it dies soon  with another kitchenaid product . 
i tried to drain the baby pool and it got everywhere . 
i m used to buying the walgreen s brand of these types of pufs . 
i returned and bought seidio num_extend which leaves this one in the dust . 
unfortunately ,  i m going to have to return it . 
was working great until then . i don t see any warranty with the product . 
this set is nothing like my original set . 
you would think that something this simple would be without difficulties . 
it gave a different reading each time i attached it to the num_extend
we bought this game based one the terrific hype and reviews . 
on inspection ,  there are a lot of redundant threads on the inside . 
when you push straight down on the top of that neck ,  the neck inverts down into the capsule . 
ok . i used a lot of shampoos but this one beats all records of useless ingredients for hair growth . 
wii play is a pretty big disappointment ,  especially considering how much fun wii sports is . 
i m glad it worked for others ,  but i m staying away from sustenex . 
had this for a little over a month and the back of it cracked . 
i triple checked and it was the required battery . 
i have used boresnakes for years for my handguns and rifles ,  of all calibers . 
there are a ton of chemicals and additives added . 
there is a little gap on both the sides that you can see and feel when holding phone . 
people take their kids to farms to see it collected and cooked . 
i like this lotion except for one thing . 
bought this under the influence of many positive reviews . 
a mess to season andclean but the food becomes tasty ,  unlike the   champ s  results . 
unfortunately ,  it stains very easily  beet juice  and it doesn t wash off . 
you have to hold the mic button to listen . 
you start out like in the movie .  .  . right where neo was in the office being chased by agents . 
i have thrown away the equivelent to num_num from all of the crumbs . 
these have a long rise and roomy butt; and are totally different from my others . 
and how do you learn to tie the laces of a piece that doens t stay in place . 
i hope the battery life holds up better on mine than on others  . 
both were in bad condition dents finish was poor . 
you must look at your press manual to determine which style of shell plate you need . 
i turned the switches ,  i pressed the switches ,  i shook them ,  i couldn t make them work . 
that s not enough time for the product to work . 
i was totally disappointed since the fm transmitter was unable to play the music from ipod . 
the shoe itself fit fine ,  was not too tight anywhere . 
i was accused of lieing about opening this product when i never opened it at all . 
i do not want to put my babies at risk if the del monte co . 
so i have a basic uniden blue tooth that was about $
i was only able to take these for about num_num days because they made my stomach hurt so much . 
fyi ,  i am a consumer and am not associated with any of these manufacturers or retailers that sell products . 
i like my students enough not to subject them to this awful game . 
i asked them if early num_extend consoles produced in num_num don t work with their product . 
lasts as long as regular batteries ,  i was disappointed in this product . 
it easily accomodate my iphone with bumper case and is inconspicuous under my untucked running shirt . 
it s such a shame because it worked really well while it lasted . 
the game would have been just as good without all the extra blood and guts . 
even with my intel num_extend extreme and num_extend of num_extend ram ,  this card produces choppy video . 
i can get use to the sluggish and smaller ball ,  but i wish the software were compatible . 
with the right ear buds these things could be really amazing !  . 
it is pretty compact and a nice size . 
there are plenty of dirt on the lens num_extend
its hard to find these types of chargers since mac switched to the magnetic type . 
it is true to size around the band but the cup size was way too large . 
i was so surprised with such wonderful reviews that this product only made my tank worse . 
she is playful and loves interactive toys ,  particularly when treats are involved . 
i recently bought another bluetooth device from jabra . 
yuck . i realize this is very subjective and others may enjoy this scent . 
tried to replace the battery and that didn t help . 
the graphics on the otehr hand arent that bad . 
my hair feels very clean afterwards ,  and not limp like heavy conditioners can leave it . 
this thing couldnt handle being on an airsoft gun . 
what s the deal with that ?  that isn t even final fantasy at all ,  just like the ff movie . 
i actually really like the added size and weight ,  makes it easy to hold the phone firmly . 
there are better equipped first aid kits to be had on amazon for much less money . 
i only hope that num_extend and num_extend are better ,  but i m not sure if they will be . 
many times during the day it seems to  fall asleep  and does not respond for a few seconds . 
can t believe no one has nailed this down yet like the banana plug insert . 
we like the organic potatoes and this brand ,  just not in garlic version . 
i am really disappointed and won t purchase this brand again . 
though i can t remember where i stashed the rest . 
this seemed like a good idea and the product quality was good . 
otherwise ,  the packaging and labels on the product were exactly the same . 
i went to the store after the apps had been sitting in the queue num_num hours . 
there s a quick attack button ,  a slow attack button ,  and a dodge button . 
ordered my case num_num days ago .  . it should have arrived yesterday . 
yes ,  the game is old ,  but even old games these days sell for at least $
need to be able to see what the expiration date is . 
i ordered three of these toys for my dog at once after having had several in the past . 
this product never seemed to stick to the screen of the phone . 
the discs included with the trap are incredibly difficult to use . 
this shovel should be sale as a toy  !  !  not a real shovel . 
i did a lot of research before buying this dog food and heard so many good things about it . 
no problem setting it up ,  performance was fine ,  the case is durable . 
being impatient ,  i just jumped on in and thought i was going to kick some butt . 
the mixer starts ,  runs num_num seconds and shuts down . she owned the num_extend previously . 
it is very flimsy and cheap and looks very cheap even for the cheap price . 
this product does not have a good coverage if a fondation is not used before applying . 
i am a professional industrial designer and always looking for a new  it  instrument for sketching and doodling . 
its is super strong on any basic surface under very normal conditions . 
i haven t really used this one yet ,  .  .  . looks a little cheap and not all silver like it is in picture . 
i believe they advertise that it takes about two minutes which is not the case . 
i used this product on a philips dvd recorder . 
this product should be pulled from the market and redesigned . 
my husband will eat anything ,  he s a human garbage disposal ,  so he had no trouble with it . 
unless you are obsessed with natural ,  don t buy this product . 
i used the product for the first time today for num_num minutes . 
the gameplay :  it s just uninteresting !  you walk around as bruce lee from a side view ,  a side view . 
grand theft auto num_num is a much better game than this for the num_extend
and to think i thought splinter cell was cumbersome when i first played it . 
i just don t feel good about using this diffuser . 
i paid full price for this product thinking that expense somehow equated to results . 
they are both stuck in up position and no longer fit in their cases . 
i gave this watch a num_num after owning it for almost num_num years . 
this is why i gave it a num_num star rating . 
his feet always felt hot and sweaty ,  even in the morning before the heat was intense . 
i was very excited when this product came out . 
nows when the ability to get refunds for digitally downloaded games would come in handy . 
this is a case where i need a product and need to make it from parts . 
oh ,  the ever great counter system that isnt there . 
then you take another shower ,  and the color is almost gone . 
you have to have man like hands to open the pot . 
i do not feel that my skin is super sensitive . 
rather than tweak that system ,  wham they are useless now . 
i dont recommend this product for mountain bike . 
sadly ,  when they came ,  i couldn t get them up . 
this bag is bulky ,  and the lining is so thin between compartments that the bag has no structure . 
my biggest problem with this product is the fact that it broke within a few months of using it . 
unfortunately ,  the one they sent was an inch shorter . 
i proceeded to step num_num when he started tearing it apart . 
the  antenna  is a long string and hangs out the top of the car . 
this game had potential if the story stayed about serial killer and didn t drift off so far . 
the federal food ,  drug ,  and cosmetic act  see section num_num for definitions  has never defined the term extract . 
because of its complexity ,  i didn t like it . 
also to the reviewer that said there num_num year old can play because the game was mostly icons . 
no room for the mouse . as i never could get the volumn controls or gaming keys to work . 
we ve had it for at least four years . 
now it looks like i am in the same situation ,  less than two months later . 
this is the only treat they wouldn t eat it . 
so i thought this would be a breeze . my goal was to free up my proxy server for other uses . 
otherwise ,  i would recommend trying the urbz :  sims in the city instead of bustin  out . 
and geez ,  some of those cut scenes are obnoxiously long . 
this thing is so tiny it looks like it belongs to a baby . 
i have two somewhat success num_extend i ride at num_num psi . 
once you got something on it and washed it that was it . 
it looks large because of the dome shape ,  but it is surprisingly small . 
they have had several nylabone toys ,  but this one is the least favorite . 
be better to your kitty than i was and do not make the mistake i did . 
if you actually put the coins in the wallet the zipper breaks . 
the software provided installs the driver ,  and the programming software provided allows you to program your control . 
really ,  after this section ,  the game just turns into more  creating  for your own type of creature . 
the one i received is a black on the outside and the same shape . 
he s quite the energetic guy so this really did little for him . 
so the cause of the problem is either my antenna ,  or the radio itself . 
it is very heavy and a good prybar however . 
it s really a shame because it was such a cute design . 
now it is a mere shadow of itself ,  and as such is totally useless . 
bottom line ,  i m getting a plantronics to replace this one . 
the good new is that you will love the dash mount for the garmin streetpilot num_num stars ,  num_num diamonds . 
i can even see the small bubbles where it didn t seal all the way . 
it looks pretty bad ,  and i m quite disappointed . 
i went through the first bottle in about num_num months . 
the exact same thing had happened to someone else i know who has an ibook . 
it was painted gloss black and was way too shiny and made firearm stick out like a sore thumb . 
they don t seem to be sized for petite women; rather taller women with long torsos . 
we ve had it for over a year and have dealt with increasing problems . 
if anyone has suggestions ,  please let me know . 
all in all i d rate this num_num stars . 
even my girlfriends noticed the smell was gone . disappointing . 
this makes for a weird looking link and goofy side kick . 
i am holding the camera standing up ,  aimed down at num_num degrees . 
the water stream projected a long way ,  but wouldn t be suitable for watering plants . 
it gave out very good illumination and heat for basking ,  so my lizards enjoyed it . 
very strange shape to the cups on this bra . 
what an expensive lesson for me .  . because the bag is going into the compost pile now . 
we are pretty tolerant of tastes and textures but the whole house agrees this stuff is almost sickening . 
this is a horrible horrible nerf gun model . 
the package says that for  sensitive electronics ,   you should get a clamping voltage rating of num_extend or lower . 
it not even num_num months later and it has had to be replaced num_num times and repaired twice . 
i suggest taking a look at a mora knife . 
i am truck driver ,  so i like a heavy duty case . 
half the features don t even work !  that s just sick . 
world s best cat litter ,  clumping formula was free with purchase at the pet store . 
this one my still be laying under the car seat ,  but needs to be thrown away . 
i first plugged my powered off kindle fire hd num_num inch to it . 
as far as i am concerned this is the best gun oil you can buy . 
i cannot say that it is exactly as fun as the concept of playing in virtual jello . 
don t confuse the superior zassenhaus with an inferior ,  decorative box grinder sold here . this grinder is extremely loud . 
it s sitting in my drawer i didn t bother to return because it was so inexpensive . 
one ,  niggling ,  but very important flaw keeps me from giving even a num_num star rating on this toy . 
at $ it also comes with a lifetime warranty and you can use metal utensils in it . 
i bought this milk for my kids at another store for way cheaper . 
the worst levi s purchase i make in my entire life ,  looks like a cheap copy of the original ones . 
sometimes they gobble them up and other times they won t eat them at all . 
i should have returned it ,  but i was lazy . 
one tablespoon of brewer s yeast num_extend provides me with % chromium and % selenium . 
this stuff just does not taste that great to me will not buy again  !  . 
this ball does not work unless you have a playful cat or a hungry cat . 
after the terrible music was muted i found the controls were very slippery . 
i ended up using an old pair of spanks instead of this bulky awkward thing . 
that s the little port on the left side of the phone . 
 i have num_num small kids and num_num dogs  . 
i then tried the remote s code search ability ,  without any luck . 
the pads are pleather and terribly uncomfortable ,  whilst having an almost starchy texture to them . 
well ,  it tastes rather like the inside of a fig newton bar . 
i am not amused ,  but my daughter wanted to keep it anyway . 
sometimes i need to push down on the lid so that it will lock and pressurize . 
it won t scare the wits out of you like system shock num_num or doom ,  but it ll do . 
however ,  i found this a tedious and moderately difficult task ,  and i am a very experienced cook and baker . 
the water bottle is made of soft plastic . 
these things work for merely seconds at full blast if that . 
in general the gameplay pales in comparison to halo or timesplitters num_extend or num_extend
we ve always had at least num_num labs with us . 
we don t have all the time in the world . 
their answer to this problem was to try to make rapeseed oil edible for humans ,  because naturally ,  it s not . 
the spring does not hold the bottle in place . 
i think i will maybe try something with ceremides perhaps next time . 
the sound of my shure num_extend were much better ,  but they are far more expensive . 
i even ordered a new one  and recoil spring . 
youtube videos for instance would not play at all ,  regardless of which browser i used . 
only the height of an adult makes that possible . 
its been on the old xbox version for two years now . 
i am not disappointed in this palette but its not one of my favorites . 
good corn ,  but sifting num_num pounds of popcorn to eliminate the kernal size rocks is a bummer . 
five minutes of flight time per num_num minutes of charging time . 
the cover is thin and harsh and inconveniently larger than the pad under it . 
after doing so though ,  the headset was loose in my ear because the gel was too small . 
this is not a good product to use in taller tanks . 
unfortunatley there s not much that can be done about that . the controls fair no better . 
if you want classic spyro ,  your looking in the wrong place . 
my num_num month old puppy has really ugly tearstains . 
it seems no matter what i prepare in this pan ,  it sticks and is diffcult to clean . 
first ,  i felt the springs on my heels ,  and my heels became sore in the middle of the day . 
this costume isn t even worth the num_num dollars i paid for it . 
amazon ,  as always ,  is amazing with their customer service and made it right . 
the first problem was that the front piece of acrylic came loose and fell out ,  multiple times . 
even when i lifted them up to dust them ,  they were still stuck together . 
it s a good thing i only bought one at a local store . 
i also tried an num_extend and it fit fine with thinner socks ,  so they may run slightly big . 
however after some stuff  chicken  seemed far too rare ,  i got suspicious . 
pieces eventually broke but they lasted over a decade . 
cost $ and holds the streetpilot ,  dash mount  mandatory option  cellphone ,  sunglasses ,  and wallet . 
they fit very comfortably and when i used them they did not leak at all . 
some worms are still escaping ,  though not as many . 
i had used a couple before to top off my flash light . 
the magnifier part is ok ,  but i never even got it over my head to try it . 
the handle is too flimsy and there is not sufficient grip by the velcro to use this product easily . 
in short ,  you ll have to beat this game in one sitting . 
i do travel regularly for business ,  but do not typically use more than num_num bag per trip . 
after the first time i washed the parts ,  it stopped working . 
we bought this to replace our ergo electric knife ,  that we have had for many years . 
small critters need soft ,  fresh hay ,  but this hard stuff is only fit for horses . 
my first box of plain oskri coconut bars were delicious and a huge hit backpacking . 
first of all ,  i apologize to all of you who love this game . 
if it was touched ,  then all you could hear was static . 
save the girl ,  defeat the darkness and restore the universe . 
the now works as good at the metamucil wafers . now foods psyllium husk num_extend num_num capsules . 
however ,  i do have sensitive skin so that might be the reason . 
they feel good ,  the cable itself feels heavy duty and of good quality . 
i would have liked more ginger in the taste and less sweet . 
for the channels num_num through num_num or so ,  the required size is in the meter range . 
but of late ,  the chews are coming in very small pieces . 
sound familiar ? and the final reason i am disappointed by halo num_extend it s trite ,  but i m passionate about it . 
don t depend on this ,  it s a scam that s made in china . i ve seen many similar reviews for this item too . 
i tried the darkest shade available ,  which still ended up being about num_num shades too light . 
i purchased this from amazon and they were the seller of this product . 
there s still probably a better bowl out there for you . 
i scraped and rubbed and there is still a ton of adhesive stuck to the side of the frame . 
the screen looks like a drenched comic book that just got pulled out of the gutter . 
call quality and sound were both very good . 
the upside to this powder is that i only paid $ something for it . 
after a few minutes of air drying ,  my head looks like a huge wet oil pack . 
for some reason i thought this had a num_extend in radius  ,  . 
obviously i charged the battery a full day before i even attempted to mow the grass . 
it also has a much more sturdy snap than the gentle leader . edit . 
they do not move well on carpet or any other surface for that matter . 
and it sure does not have to be wrapped in plastic . 
i finally put the infernal thing in the garbage ,  where it belongs . 
this cable started having issues when it came to detecting my keyboard . 
it seemed to actually dry my hair out . i don t know what the other ingredients are in this product . 
we pulled this piece of junk out today in an attempt cut a small limb of softwood . 
multiplayer only ?  ok ,  ok ,  i need to settle down here . 
it also was coated in some oil or grease . 
exactly like the way the did gta iii series . 
even when i have the wlan hooked to my dsl connection at home the web browsing is dog slow . 
but the suprise that it was made in china was big for a german knife company . 
i ve had this knife for about num_num years and i used it moderately to divide perennials . 
this game is somewhat long . i was not all that impressed with the graphics . 
i started doing missions for characters who were just standing in corners of malls . 
within that time amazon told me they had already pulled it for shipping . 
for a $ phone ,  i expected something far more polished . 
currently they have a $ coupon bringing the price down to $
instead you need to get in a group and just sit around while high levels kill everything for you . 
here s what i found : being primarily flour ,  sugar and shortening it was still  good  as far as edibility . 
am i asking for too much ?  i love the safe edge concept and was happy for a while . 
of course you ll lose a friend ,  but well worth it !  game > friendship . 
i bought this because it seemed sturdy enough to hold my samsung epic phone . 
without cloud or squall the game would have been thrown out by most . 
heck ,  even that pail of water mentioned in another one star review is a better alternative !  . 
 :   i researched it a little more and began to realize how awful the ingredients truly are . 
at first i was struck dumb by the quality of the cut scenes . 
sharp num_extend was expensive and was only edtv ,  so did some research on olevia . 
the graphics and interactions are very bad ,  but the game is playable . 
i finally gave in and bought this product during a friday sale for $
i think the company needs to make the ds a worthwhile purchase ,  in and of itself . 
ok i guess for small office area but not a reliable fan . 
i wouldn t feel comfortable knowing i may have to rely on this in the future . 
they do fold back to create a cuff to catch drips . these gloves run small . 
it s not whipped and its not hard like chunky blocks . 
i do give it num_num stars because at least the fragrance used isn t horrible ,  just heavy . 
maybe i got a dud ,  but my two cats couldn t care less about this toy . 
i wish there was an option to rate items at zero stars . 
i have a num_num year old and thought this would be a great art project to do together . 
i spose for no important reason this blade would do you subpar okay . 
this blurriness makes it down right impossible sometimes to make the many jumps required . 
my kids  bikes were also rubbed ,  dented ,  and scratched . buy any other rack but this one . 
i am gonna have to try something else . 
btw ,  earth therapeutics products are made in china . 
it s not like she is going to sing the rest of it when she doesn t even know it . 
once you ve played through level one you ve just about seen all it has to offer . 
it also leaves a strong after tan odor on me . 
i ordered a num_num and they feel more like an num_num or even smaller . 
i thought this would fit my skinny num_num yr old cat . 
the special tubes of cream that are meant to reduce fine lines and wrinkles were also a disappointment . 
my skin stays moisturized well into the next day and then i start all over again . 
hardly what i d choose to call  fresh stacks  . the crackers themselves were fine . 
we ve had the mouse for several months and she will not play with it . 
one reason why the twisted metal series was so great ,  was new innovation to the car combat genre . 
consumer labs has also tested probiotics and has reported many products of questionable quality in the marketplace . 
we bought this trap and in num_num days we had nothing . 
i was under the impression that i would be able to pull them over my elbow but i cannot . 
initially i thought it had overheated ,  so i unplugged it and tried again the next day . 
they didn t even add the elimination chamer match on this game like they did on here comes the pain . 
the rod that connects both ends of the tool ,  well one of the rods apparently came loose . 
i took my camera to a local shop and they blasted my sensor clean with the air pump . 
quaker oats should bring the old version back . 
i switched to an organic macadamia nut oil product called bee nuts and have had great luck with it . 
i asked her if they would fix the problem ,  and she told me that she won t know . 
i ve tried it out of the tube as well as with a lip brush . 
i will probably have to send this back . 
there is echoes ,  garbled reception ,  and callers on the other end almost can not understand the speech at all . 
and ,  i think ,  for the price ,  you aren t getting anywhere near enough product . 
i can t believe i ve had to do all this research just to find a decent food . 
yet ,  at any time ,  any lap ,  i spin towards the left . 
threw them in a box for use on ?  lucky i tested them before use . 
third use was still slippery ,  could not hold any pose . 
reception seems adequate ,  but this is pretty cheaply made . 
i will be sending this one back as well . 
i was all set to like these ,  but they just didn t grab me . 
should i give geotrax a second chance ?  or are they all this lifeless ?  . 
i would stay away from this one ,  i m currently returning it myself . 
i pulled it off and went withbelkin clear screen protector for apple iphone num_extend num_extend pack  . 
not sure if i would give this another chance . 
i searched for accessories for my new droid x . 
so ,  the bottom line is drivers can not be loaded . cold eyes . 
you can easily bubble it with your finger . 
i did not see a difference in the level of mold or mildew in my apartment after using it . 
these shoes looked so cute ,  and i couldn t wait to wear them . 
after ner next shower she dryed her dair most of the way with a hair dryer . 
addicted to violence and  mature  content ,  or  c . 
the product was reasonably priced and arrived on time . 
the trendnet router is now with my spare parts collection in the basement . 
but the network issue seems to persist ,  and even the most current update has not fixed this . 
i used this product for two months faithfully twice a day . 
the result was that there was interesting stuff to look at ,  but it didn t really provide much narrative support . 
whatever you sprinkle it on ,  it gets lumpy . 
this is how i know they stand up to being thrown across the room . 
first ,  it gets extremely laggy sometimes for no apparent reason . 
first ,  it has a very strong menthol odor . 
i am very careful to brush my dogs  teeth gently ,  but their gums still bleed a little . 
this thing will just keep recording until you press stop ,  or until the disc is full . 
i purchased this because i thought seidio was a good company for cell phone accessories . 
well the filter is now leaking black carbon sand like pieces into the filtered water . 
after reading a bunch of great reviews when i purchased this ,  i was excited to use it . 
i sure won t be tempted to have too much . 
i returned at the next day . when amazon credits my account ,  i m going to buy a logitech num_extend
i left it in the cage for a good month ,  but no interest ever . 
even knowing what it was ,  i was hesitant to actually drink liquid thru it . 
it does not conceal any redness or dark circles . 
amazon did check on it for me and got an answer as to where it was which i appreciate . 
there is an odd almost perfume type of taste to this ginger . 
i think they didn t like the feel of the litter or maybe the smell . 
i have no idea whether that is  allowed  with this machine . 
i was extremely disappointed with the fact that it is very difficult to get any bubbles to come out . 
i used the soap dispenser and it worked okay ,  but nothing fancy about it . 
several people on car forums i am a member of receive defective items including myself . 
i m actually throwing it out ,  it s that bad . 
when the coffee had too much sediment ,  we tried a paper filter . 
i have had nothing but good luck with warehouse deals so i went for it . 
we could not figure out the cause . the pot would move while coffee was brewing . 
no ,  thank you . do yourself a favor and buy something else . 
small enough to fit in a standard oven . 
i ordered this advantage and was sent num_extend advantix that my dog endedup having a bad reaction to . 
my cheap rubber boots provide better water resistance than these !  warm ?  another joke . 
not the best solution ,  but better for me than having to wear short pants . 
have never used it , wasn t willing to  wire up  my bike to use it . 
if you buy this ,  you will need to buy the gamecube controllers . 
this cat food is a serious reject for all my num_num cats and even the ferals won t eat it . 
i need to find another brand that the cats enjoy eating . 
the machine is not complicated to use ,  but doesn t really do the job . 
stevia is almost impossible to find in a consistent unadulterated state . 
now i doubled the amount of coffee ,  maybe that will at least give it some taste . 
there is a difference between  dried  and  all dried up  . 
i put it back on and taped it and it still came off again . 
at the highest setting this thing sounds like an aircraft carrier taking off . 
even setting the computer to a default dmz did not solve the problem . 
my dog understands what the collar does ,  and is a perfect angel when he has it on . 
ordered this item because it was advertised for powerful chewers . 
i thought maybe i would have a better experience here and i could sew the ripped strap . 
if they ever come out with a num_extend i m pretty sure i won t get it . 
nice for the collection but would do it over again . 
this toaster sucks !  i bought it while i was in school . 
i would definitely recommend the clear not this one . 
what i like least is that a very high percentage of cans i open require draining . 
i finally had to go directly to creative s web site to get the most current drivers . 
what people like is a matter of personal taste ,  but i won t ever buy this tea again . 
i don t know how it can be called a freeze super spray ,  for it is definitely not . 
they sound like this :  there will be no interferring in the .  .  .  . single num_extend
i have an older kitty who has kidney disease and hyperthyroid ,  was losing weight and refusing to eat . 
without being too long winded ,  check out the reviews for this phone regarding dropped service . 
if you want you character to be good in melee weapons; then you smash things with a sword . 
altho i really don t like to give nestle anything . 
i can t see hearing this in the great outdoors . 
this has been a bit disappointing in regard to the signal quality i get for my home theater pc . 
i am seriously considering it as my main drive with my old num_extend as backup . 
i don t care how cheap it is ,  i expect it to last more than num_num months . 
either find a licensed product or trust that your num_num will stay in good health . 
we were buying bully sticks from our local dog food outlet and they were great because they lasted forever . 
worthless !  my old num_num disc pioneer changer that is all of num_extend years old is still working just fine . 
they are built more for purpose than comfort ,  with a rubbery foot bed and gripping sole . 
its also to tight for my phone and literally so hard to get your phone out of the case . 
and the stink from this brand .  .  . i just sprayed fabreeze and light a candle . 
because it is really hard to get now ,  crazy prices . 
this was probably one of the worst mascaras i have ever purchased including dime store brands . 
i like the battery life and the stereo ear buds but i wouldn t get it again . 
the game makes no sense in general ,  and the instructions are terrible . 
it may work well for other devices .  .  . i cannot determine the possibility . 
it did not massage my scalp as described and it is not worth the price tag . 
about a month ago it stopped griping the can well . 
one of the reasons was to play silent hunter num_extend
and lastly ,  how do i take a photo of something not happening . 
i m going to keep this short and to the point . 
i tried to make him drink inspite but he just would not after his first sip . 
however ,  how many do you have to bring with you to be certain of a good one ?  . 
after num_num days it would no longer work for data ,  but continued to work for charging . 
my num_num kittens just aren t that interested in it . 
they went in it once and it shook and was unstable enough to scare them away . 
i just ordered the htc oem extended battery for thunderbolt . 
the rubber gasket flips up and down so there s a small pop when you go to empty it . 
i don t perspire much but this product did not keep my underarms dry . 
i gave the black one to good will and will probably do the same with the other one . 
the game tried to make its interface unique and it ended up making the game more complex . 
comparing it to games today it still gets a fairly decent score in the fun department . 
i ve even tried a primer on my lids ,  but it does not keep them away . 
if you plan to use it with softer vegetables try it . 
i bought the set for both female and male back in july . 
yes ,  weight is only % of the concern that aerodynamics are when you are considering maintaining speed . 
with every step the boot would cave in around my ankle and cause a very sharp stabbing pain . 
the package arrived badly damaged ,  however ,  the packets survived . 
it is very simple and may be fun for children ,  but there is no real challenge to this game . 
it tells me room temperature is num_num degrees . 
they have the same stupid a . i ,  and the same idiotic story . 
the mascara is so think it s like jello and sits on top of the brush . 
it s an ugly shade of blue and it s a very cheap quality . 
the package arrived torn open on the bottom so the drops were stale . 
it s much to shiny ,  and the plasticky look is a turnoff . 
i gave it to a friend and bought another drinkwell for home . 
it cooked a small piece of salmon well enough ,  but again it was hard to get clean . 
they are very wiggley !  i really thought they would fall if sitting in this chair . 
a couple years ago i bought him a eflite blade tandem rescue . 
legendary is continuous suicide ,  also period . if you like shooters ,  it is time to move on . 
i think just using the nose inhaler would work better . 
you re better off spending an extra $ on  mangroomer essential nose and ear hair trimmer  here on amazon . 
it is obvious nabisco is going after people who enjoy girl scout thin mint cookies . 
they were a lot cheaper than those from lexar ,  simple ,  etc . 
never ,  ever had it happened before  and as i said ,  i ve been waxing ,  shaving and epilating for years  . 
the sound problem still exists but it s not a big deal . 
the barely smell of fresh brewed coffee was not there ,  and the taste was awful . 
i could have had that happen with a tool from the dollar store . 
also ,  my dog was not comfortable wearing it . 
dropped it from very small distance and it cracked and the bow flew off . 
it seems to work fine on my rug ,  but on hardwood . 
in the winter my skin gets very dry and on some areas experience some type of extremely itchy rash . 
the reason i wanted to try this is because a benzoyl peroxide product was breaking me out . 
the sound was probaly the better part of this game . 
actually the dove body wash is much more moist and makes skin smoother . 
this controller feels very nice in your hands ,  but it just doesn t work . 
this might deter any thieves ,  but i really doubt it . 
it s not a very good smelling perfume to me . 
i have asthma and allergies ,  but none to the ingredients in this product . 
the clip belt brokes and it is not working . 
i decided to send it back when a found that the product website no longer exists . 
it s almost like eating a sweettart in liquid ,  carbonated form . 
while the phone is large by today s cell phone standards ,  it is a great looking unit and functions well . 
i wore them around the house and my first mtp joints started smarting after about an hour . 
now i have to go search for it . 
so i tried the recommended num_num tablespoon to num_extend of water . 
but ,  so does my hair and my shampoo . 
no problem ,  the phone isn t provisioning on the att network . 
liquids always fly out the hole designed to add stuff while processing . 
i wanted somthing to watch my netflix on but this did not do the job . 
when you push it sometimes it slides and makes a little squeal noise . 
pay little bit extra and get good quality and durable screen protector . 
the kitten loves laser pointers but i do not love using them . 
admittedly ,  have only used once to make waffles ,  which came out fine . 
anyway ,  understandably i m now wary of this wire . 
five stars for the ones i got at the store ,  two for the junk sent from amazon . com llc . 
i purchased these headphones because of the good rating ,  but maybe i just got a lemon . 
the bosch icon wiper blade is bosch s top of the line frameless wiper . 
if you re prone to migraines like me  especially the hormonal monthly sort  then avoid like the plague . 
i need a better tool to open an close clasp . 
something tells me their standards for dog toothpaste are even lower . 
no battery should cost so much and be worthless after just a few months of recharging . 
im not trippin hard it was only $ and some change . 
unfortunately  as another example of really bad software engineering  ,  you can t quit the program for real . 
the quality is super duper cheap and it seems like % of girls at oktoberfest wear this exact costume . 
i should have known that there was something wrong when there s a leather jacket offered for $ bucks . 
then ,  i wake up at num_extend in pitch black with ice water on my feet . 
i hate when games places so many restrictions on them and it s really stupid to do that . 
the overall hearing protector should have an adjustable head band . 
please do me a favor people ,  and  reconsider if you should so desire  . 
for the record ,  the ups was kept on in a cool ,  well ventilated area . 
i emailed the seller and since it was over num_num days ,  they said i needed to contact the manufacturer . 
there needs to be more emphasis on foot soldiers . 
i purchased them at the same time as the gun . 
march num_extend num_num update : i quit on this thing . 
i had a sip ,  didn t spit it out ,  but really didn t want to try it again . 
there was good padding on the heel but the arch was a complete nothing . 
and even ones i leave in overnight don t work . 
it s a darn lead pencil  equivalent  ,  not friggin  sliced bread . 
they thought it was swiss and would not touch it since it was not cold from the fridge . 
this was my second jawbone ,  and about the num_extend headset i ve owned . 
i am suprised that amazon is selling this for $
no tingle which would be common ,  i used it on my chest area and got a growth that developed . 
i had to buy a serial num_extend card . 
in any event ,  if you re getting a gamecube bundle ,  you re not going to have much choice . 
my daughter was pining for this really badly . 
i got this gas ring to bring my wok closer to the heat of my gas stove . 
an hour later and a few modifications i got it to fit . 
perhaps that s why she doesn t like it  :   . 
it looked so cute on line ,  but it s not in person . 
the texture was too watery to really detangle or soften my hair . 
overall for the price this thing costs its great . 
if you re a moron who doesn t know any better this game is for you . 
the replacement came in today ,  first thing i checked was that wire through the grill slots ,  it was attached . 
i didn t know the crocs came to me from footsmart ,  not amazon ,  when i ordered . 
i could never get a lot of moves done the way i asked for . 
unfortunately ,  once you have something in the wizard ,  it s there . 
it even refuses to run if you have process explorer running on your pc . 
the arcusine is expensive and their selections are limited . 
this is probably a better headset for someone with smaller features . 
installed on my toshiba satellite num_extend num_num runs fine on medium graphic settings . 
happy cleanup ! no additional tools ,  accessories or support for this unit are available on the manufacturer web site . 
they are even marked weejun on the sole . ordered nov num_num and was really happy with the fit . 
on closer inspection i realized that the screw that tightens the arm was defective and wouldn t tighten . 
when i retrieved the tree ,  i found that all the collars had reverted to the most fully extended setting . 
i d rather play a num_extend than play with some stupid pen . 
i just ran around shooting stuff . much more linier than the original . 
this is the second one of these i ve purchased . 
my first sonicare lasted well over num_num years ,  but this one .  .  .  .  . a total lemon . 
as far as all the knorr varieties go ,  this is near the bottom of my list . 
well made but simply too big all around . 
it ruins them and it can t be turned off . 
i bought this as my first digital camera five months ago ,  largely on the strength of the amazon reviews . 
it is chaotic which i guess is the point ,  though . 
if they can modify this .  .  . like perhaps make the powder more course and not as fine . 
the graphics are alright ,  the game play is lame ,  and the movies are pretty much the same . 
unfortunately ,  they just did not taste that good . 
i use bha products because they are good exfoliators and also help keep blackheads under control . 
it has since moved on to terminating its wireless signal entirely . 
if the phone falls i am pretty sure case will not protect the phone . 
i have a dell num_extend with num_extend ram and a num_extend nvidia geforce num_num graphics card . 
the company should or could have labeled or even numbered them . 
however ,  this game fails in every department so i doubt it . 
i was afraid she was going to choke on the pieces . 
i tried to install this on my wife s giant mountain bike with disc brakes . 
one of my dogs couldn t tolerate this bone . 
the sizes refer to the cushion part of the shoe . 
not easy to use ,  definitely needs two hands . 
bleached it white !  !  i shampooed with no conditioner ,  completely dried hair before applying ,  but it wouldn t last the night . 
i really don t know what to say about this brush hmmmmmm . 
i have tried to pop the kernels with and without oil . 
imagine my disappoinment !  after testing some more i had to sit with my grandma for another session . 
without a power supply ,  the drive will not power up at all when connected with firewire . 
the best tasting bar i ve ever had ,  and i ve tried plenty . 
i wanted to return this ,  but my son threw it away . 
yellow switch  gives luigi his flutter jump in the main num_extend
you run your stubbly little legs as fast as you can . 
the aftertaste is horrible !  !  !  after reading all of the other reviews i thought it was worth a try . 
the picture and description states ardell duo eyelash adhesive dark tone .  .  .  . waterproof . 
the faster you press the more it sounds like an actual song . 
had to toss it into the trash where it belongs . 
i also have to wonder how safe this toy is . 
summer night is the usual crickets ,  etc and was clear . 
don t buy these unless you have legs like spongebob . 
i will also contact mr coffee to tell them about my experience so they are aware of it . 
a dusting of ground espresso lined the bottom of the ground coffee holder . 
i remember when bike computers were really expensive ,  but at least those worked . 
very square in the design so they look funny on . 
first off ,  let me just say that i had a great time playing gta num_extend
the msg just adds to the unpleasant flavor notes . 
right away i noticed the bottles looked different . 
a canning funnel will accomplish that ,  but it is an extra step and another utensil to clean . 
i washed it with water  as recommended  ,  but this made it worse . 
a dollar bill folded num_num ways is the same size and thickness . 
does come with miracle product inside of it ready to num_extend
not what i ordered . they are no where near what was described . 
they were completely unprofessional and never even sent an order acknowledgment or shipping notice . 
all it did was thicken the mixture and add a tiny hint of sweetness . 
who cares . so i am $ in the hole . 
this does not support wpa ,  which is much more secure than wep . 
easy to load ,  high capacity are negated by easily jams ,  and when it jams it mangles the darts . 
i read the dimensions ,  but the baby is just so much smaller than i anticipated . 
first off read the review titled :   not bad . 
the material they are made from is also a much lighter weight than i remember levi jeans of old . 
this headset was so bulky and it looks very cheap . 
the similarities end there . game play is nice and fast paced . 
eventually the valve broke and it s obvious why . 
this sits under my sink and maybe i ll mix it with my indian clay or something . 
they didnt feel as awesome as some people say . 
it will fit a aquaclear num_num ph or above but not good for the num_extend or num_num models . 
so i m not sure how sweat resistant this will be . 
even the graphics in this game are poor compared to games with similar system requirements . finally my last complaint . 
i am not sure how much to take ,  but three tablets did not do one thing for me . 
although it is comfortable ,  that is part of the problem . 
it is nice looking ,  i just didn t like the face because it was much smaller then i expected . 
even restarts sometimes does not get it back . 
it was junky and i returned the item . 
then ,  scramble them up in random order ,  toss them together with a flimsy story ,  and go . 
while it looks good when i first put it on ,  it doesn t stay on . 
overall ,  it is more like one of those disgusting chewy protein bars than a indulgent snack bar . 
all i can say is don t waste your money ,  this is a very cheap compass . 
this popcorn popper is supposed to cook num_num cups . 
our two shipments of this particular product were just fine ,  quality looks fine . 
this game does not at all take advantage of the psp s graphical power . 
for what i paid for it i am really upset about it . 
i did not like this lotion at all . 
i used this product in my planted num_num and num_num gallon tanks with no noticeable difference . 
it s there regardless of whether any music is playing or not . 
i did notice that a mineral ingredient highlighted on the package was copper . 
based on his short life ,  i would not recommend this toy . 
this game is awesome ,  but it is also way over hyped by the video game junket ,  i . e . 
it is just that this one was not my favorite . 
i was going to return them but my wife tossed them . 
i will not recommend this router to anyone . 
but i couldn t use it more than num_num time . 
this was the absolute ugliest cheap looking robe i have ever bought in my entire life . 
the texture is  great  if you know what i mean .  . look for something else . low delivery speed as well . 
it is very confusing and not worth getting into . 
due to many complaints ,  they ve just added num_num new quests . 
num_num months later ,  both speakers developed cracks in the poly speaker cones ,  which quickly split and basically fell apart . 
it is not stable because of the design ,  which is clearly meant for round burners . 
i ended up having to get a prescription strength cream . 
not good quality ,  sound okay but not the quality of the product . 
i can get about num_num days out of my stock battery  as long as i am not playing videos  . 
i ve been trying for a week to get this to work . 
the white gold looked like pewter ,  not even silver gray . 
what kind of engineering is this ?  if it s not charging ,  don t turn the light on . 
definitely not something i would pick up again . 
now i see why this thing was only $ retail . 
i m still not sure why  i ll explain in a second  . 
it has been consistently reliable for me and i used it successfully to conceive my son . 
it was just ok until it broke about three weeks in . 
this does not fit the inside space of the vent  the vent crank gets in the way  . 
if you get num_num months out of it i would be very surprised . 
either the battery is too small or not fully charging fully  or both  . 
if i had it to do over again ,  i d purchase a different brand of coffee maker . 
the sound quality is pretty scratchy and i ve had people say it s hard to hear me sometimes . 
my favorite nfs thus far is most wanted and the original older hot pursuit  pc  . 
bought this based on some online videos and reviews for putting together a first aid kit . 
but this does not compensate for the poor sound quality . 
since the unit is new out of the box ,  it s going back for replacement  circuit city  . 
it doesn t have any vanilla smell as they claim . 
i went to open a small can of mushrooms and it didn t work . 
i removed the case ,  called the same number . 
i m quadriplegic and unable to work on iphone when covered up whith this surface . 
even more so for lower volume ,  high pressure tires on motorcycles and bicycles . 
i can still use it i just have to spray it heavily . 
only works on iphones but does not charge ipads . 
make sure your cat likes catnip before you buy this product . 
this is just the same old stuff ,  folks . 
we have had a lot of problems with my wife s phone and its replacement . 
i have the same problem as other reviewers . 
amazon gave me full credit when i called and told them it s all alcohol !  . 
my problem ?  the vhs works; the dvd sound comes and goes . 
it is charged and be ready as the spare one . 
size num_extend but these were way too big . 
not a good product and to much hassle to box up and pay to send back . 
the large on this glove is nothing like the gardening and work gloves size large . 
the smell is mild and so far my skin didn t have a bad reaction to the product . 
it was thin and i really was not too surprised . 
i would recommend going with an air vent mount or a cd slot mount . 
in a week i had to douse him about num_num times . 
even then ,  you can t turn the wireless radio off ,  like you can with the linksys . 
i would have loved to buy a better kind if i had the budget for it . 
enjoyed putting her face in the snout and feeling the air blowing up her face . 
not too big of a deal because i ve used natural products and was expecting little to no lather . 
on those mornings when the batteries run down you will plug in the cord and therefore be using ac . 
i have purchased the item and it works great for % of the cost of the identical canon adapter . 
they don t fit well ,  and they keep falling out ,  they just don t stay in your ear . 
i ve installed many tubes now ,  from different brands and of different types . 
the siphotrol plus fogger is a waste of money ,  it does not work . 
fit the phone nicely and i was able to shoot a time lapse of my drive to work . 
i can t even get through an hour of two of work without having to reapply this lipstick . 
my mind soon changed when i got into the game . 
well ,  i embarked on finding a new set of travel headphones after my last long plane ride . 
amazon really needs to check some of their cross reference charts . 
next i loaded the ring ,  which actually was much easier than i had anticipated based on reviews . 
this is easily one of the worst video games ever invented . 
she said our glasses never looked better and was wondering i switched . 
i tried this on other vcrs as well . i even got an exchange for a new one . 
after soaking them all night i can put them on my cereal and actually eat them . 
sometimes you have to click four or five times just to get past all of the reading . 
this is simply what obsidian does best in this game  and probably all their games  . 
i suppose these work but i assumed that i was receiving a kit but only received two pieces . 
the most stand out flavor i could detect was the apple juice ,  which is the major ingrediant . 
i m sure it s a good case if you don t mind your phone gaining about num_num sizes . 
under $ and i got num_num batteries !  well ,  now i know why . 
she was banging on the sides and trying to get out . 
the waffle bakes upside down ,  allowing gravity to work its special magic . 
first off ,  this bottle was basically the same as the item described ,  but it did look different . 
i informed her of the dyes ,  the sugar ,  the artificial flavors and more . 
the smooth edge is nice ,  but it uncovers some new crud that is withing the top can seem . 
my cat was recently diagnosed with psychogenic alopecia . 
the game play mechanics are really bad ,  and the aiming and over the shoulder view is horrible too . 
sorry tivoli ,  but doubling the price was not a good idea !  . 
i read all directions and followed them to the letter ,  to no avail . 
pull the headset off and move it closer and it is fine . 
don t play this game ,  i d rather watch the movie . 
okay ,  i play the regular sims like hd hotdate  and ss superstar  and so on ,  and maybe i m just comparing them . 
if kleenbore would modify this product to make the cleaning rod connector more secure ,  i would recommend it . 
i smelled auto emissions from other vehicles just as i had before using the product . 
these wipes seem good at first but on subsequent examination it leaves lint on the display and streaks . 
it s surprising to me because black diamond is such a great brand . 
i won t even sell it used as i want no one to have to suffer through this title . 
if i wipe it in really hard ,  i just look pale r  . 
i think others had mentioned that and i probably should have read more reviews on this one . 
i am disappointed that my lashes have not grown like the other posters have . 
guess i shouldn t fault the heating pad for doing it s job ,  but i really didn t like it . 
it look like they took a regular bag and separated it into the other bags of hair . 
everything else we ve tried is a big hit . 
after only num_num uses ,  the heating unit failed . 
that s an error in amazon s description and in those reviews . so again ,  very nice idea ,  but disappointing . 
i have yet to find one that didn t . 
it was less than num_num minutes and my yellow lab had the squeeker out and the toy shedded . 
i am disappointed because sony is usually a reliable product . 
this toy has no weight to it and it has repeatedly tumbled over with and on my tot . 
i got my old electric opener back out . 
i will never ,  ever buy this product or any other tingling lotion again . 
that fix works great and gives you an additional layer of protection . 
they had no idea what was wrong with it . 
if that s what you re looking for ,  then these sheets would be great for you . 
i now have the samsung wep and after a few weeks ,  no problems as of yet . 
the item arrived with just a bunch of loose seeds . 
purchased this item as a gift for someone who requested it . i ve never tired it . he requested it . 
got it and read the label  doesn t show online  . 
loved the shimmery look it gave me but it made me skin breakout terribly . 
but those comments were few and far between and should not have prompted a complete overhaul of the product . 
and this small amount turned the yogurt almost dark brown . 
ffs is obviously saving dollars in name of sacrificing quality and quantity . 
the only connection to the movie that this game has are the cutscenes . 
the film has covers numbered num_extend and num_extend
yes the idea of the wii nunchuk was kool ,  but the novelty has worn off now . 
i tried it for a month and could discern absolutely no benefit from this product . 
and i kept it slightly more than one month ,  i can t return it . 
you hear a very loud buzzing every time you turn on the music . 
there is a fuller rich sound for playing the fm music . 
not my favorite and won t be wearing it a whole lot . 
just sat down to put on shin guards and socks when it blew out . 
my grandchildren are gentle and this is the result . 
the plug is far too small to fit my phone ,  despite the description that this will fit  lg phones  . 
my hands ,  if not daily moisturized ,  will crack and bleed . 
so i bought the tivoli model one radio . 
i don t think my kids would miss this toy when it accidentally disappears . 
i have had my breville elite for num_num days now . 
it also did nothing for my spraying cat . 
this was fun to play with for one day ,  but then i was over it . 
every time i cook on it meal has some  metallic  taste and smell . 
i could not even use them without closing one eye . 
num_num and num_num where ok ,  but num_num was the best . 
thy are wafer thin and you have to be super careful not to get them stuck to themselves . 
i did not have time to think too much about it . 
i m somewhat new to the whole tablet scene so i ll try to make this review as fair as possible . 
i would absolutely go with the num_extend florescent every time over this light . 
they were dense ,  lasted a long time and didn t shred much till they were very old . 
this was a total waste and the puppy had no interest in it whatsoever . 
purchased the view master for a project for some elderly residents at a nursing home . 
this happened every time i tried to use the collar . 
the slant is too oblique for me; i can barely catch anything . 
i expected this would last longer for a num_num lb . 
i didn t want to end up a eunuch ,  so this had to go . 
the ikross stand is very sturdy  solid metal components  . 
very easy to scratch yourself on or snag clothing . 
they are used to fight bacteria and fungus ,  are widely available ,  and cost very little to manufacture and use . 
there was a gold box deal a few days ago and i decided to try it . 
urprised the items look different from the picture . 
it would be a lot handier if it would display the time that was originally set ,  or even zero . 
the idea for this might be good ,  but the glove is very loose and my wrist still hurts . 
i ordered a medium and could barely get it on . 
also many services ,  like email ,  would not work through the router . 
i realized i was making a couple of mistakes and after adjusting things i got much better results . 
looks like this is going to be one expensive skeet . 
it arrived with both ac and car chargers ,  both of which look very nice . 
it s thinner then both in terms of num_extend
made my skin red like a sun burn . 
i love sketchers and this shoe in particular . 
i ve used this brand before and bought a pair from amazon a few years a ago for my grandmother . 
and the phone becomes not as responsive and sometimes freeze after this hard reset . 
otherwise ,  the texture was good if you re looking for a stiff ,  sticky gel ,  so i gave it two stars . 
it is a motion sensor attached to a sprinkler . 
how many vacuum cleaners does it take to vacuum a house ?  ten . 
i couldn t get past the poor aiming and firing controls to delve deeper into the game . 
i brewed the first time with only water . 
his view was to go back to the older head due to it s smaller size . 
taking pictures with it is fairly easy and it has a bunch of nice features and modes for it . 
i gave up and threw mine away when it would not work correctly on any device . 
it also will slow down if the load is too big so for instance . 
squirrels ,  on the other hand ,  have no problem at all jumping on to it . 
however ,  this reel provides no way to actually use the cable while it s being reeled or unreeled . 
it wasn t until i forced them in while pushing the button that they went in a stayed in . 
also ,  if you make any changes to the video settings and hit  apply  . 
i m glad i ordered early for halloween ,  as i m not sure i ll keep it . 
especially not recommended for people with sensitive skin . 
but the audio quality is totally unacceptable ! followup :  i returned this camera . 
i am afraid that the unit s filter became tainted prior to shipment or was manufactured improperly . 
its too bulky and the fabric and filler are just not comfortable . 
i went to bed and fell asleep right away as usual . 
if it weren t for the string ,  i d be giving this toy a high rating . 
having owned this product for num_extend years ,  i have noticed a number of num_extend
not for me they are flimsy and fell apart would not recommend . 
i wanted a clock for my num_num year old to tinker with . 
this clip is to hard for me to unclip and my ankle hurts . 
diluted tea tree oil makes a great night toner for oily skin . 
i have suspicions that this may be a counterfeit . 
i gave up and bought a usb keyboard . 
there are so many reasons to love coloring :  it requires nothing more than a crayon  or marker  and paper . 
i played mine about num_num hour a day . 
all three felt good on my face ,  never oily or heavy . 
i ll keep buying nordic ware for baking ,  but will give a pass on anything else by them !  . 
they left some batteries in the charger ,  possibly to long knowing them ,  but regardless they blew up . 
both adapters are less than num_num feet from the access point . 
each  were to be sent to my daughters num_extend for her and num_num for myself . 
even though this wasn t expensive ,  it wasn t worth the money . 
the slik tripod is a very good unit but the quick adapter is bad . 
my akg head phones had the wire come out just one side of the headphones . 
it really does not heat up to temperature as claimed . 
in fact ,  i have better results with simple green . 
needless to say ,  it ended up in the garbage . 
the gel conformed perfectly to my mouth ,  giving a snug fit that felt good . 
it is junk and not worth a single penny . 
first off the button does not work with the iphone . 
i have to say the install went well ,  very few options to choose from in the dvd version . 
in the process water leaks out of the clean water tank requiring a whole new clean up . 
basically it is  cool  but it s not what you want in practicality . 
the last straw was when i got the three rings of death . 
it s winter and i live in california ,  so maybe it s just my location . 
touching the plastic board is feeling very fragile and like going to crack . 
i thought what i ordered was a package of num_num for num_extend
it stuck to my fingers as i applied it . 
i have hard time to make this product to work for me . 
surprised me a lot when i put this on and compared it to others from a store . 
the sound is pretty good ,  nothing exceptional or bad . 
this controller does the job ,  but in a rather lackluster manner . 
i love my jetpack because of its reliability ,  its removable battery ,  removable sim card and its global readiness . 
i should have read the reviews before i purchased this . 
she loved it and used it all the time for a few days . 
and it does not seem like too much fun . 
but just from chewing on it to get the food dispensed ,  bits and pieces started coming off . 
i loved the keyboard itself for the first few hours . then it died . 
i would put in on my roots and leave it up for num_num min . 
sadly though it didn t live up to the expectations i had for it . 
i used most of a can in a room num_extend in num_num separate applications . 
i had it one week and returned it . just did not do what the many reviews said it did . 
i have heated it under water ,  spit on it ,  tried manipulating it ,  etc . 
i m just not happy with this and certainly not for what i spent on this thing . 
near fm quality sound ,  decent range  about num_num feet  . 
i was able to select the plant from the app s plant database . 
i ordered these booties to combat my cold feet . 
energizer is good only for batteries at this point . 
the product seem cheap and didnt seem like a quality product . 
and ,  worst of all ,  the game play is just terrible . 
i believe it would hold up well if played with . 
i have been using frontline for over num_num years . 
i have a galaxy note num_num and it can barely fit in the holder . 
there is no way i can make this review fun !  . 
as for the thumb sucker ,  he didn t care ,  he just kept right on sucking his thumb . 
she looked like she thought she d never have water again . 
but they fit terribly !  the way the are constructed is just all wrong . 
the last two examples of this coffee maker barely lasted six months each !  . 
it s great to have veg options for a quick meal !  . 
you can t make different decisions ,  so its a one shot deal . stay away !  . 
the game lacks aside elements that make a complete rpg . 
apparently ,  you can make anything out of corn , my conclusion is that you cannot trust this product . 
i have bike racks ,  step hitches and trailer hitch attachments and none of them fit as poorly as this . 
its essentially a marshall stack in a box ,  and boy does it ever succeed at that . 
i am african american and have coarse hair . 
the best i get now is num_extend between two computers plugged into this switch . 
that is not small so i returned it . 
this isn t a terrible bike cover ,  but it is expensive and comes with several caveats . 
i wouldn t even allow my kids to eat this stuff . 
they are more like slim cut ,  very light jogging pants . 
upon closer inspection i noticed the green  activity light  was hard to see . 
i only gave it num_num stars because it meets it s specs . 
utterly shocked customer service wouldn t tell me the ingredients or poison control instructions . 
ordered this for use with a pc but the plugin was wrong  meant for a standard phone jack  . 
the game constantly tells you what to do and never lets you figure things out on your own . 
oz show and thought it would be the nirvana for stress relief . 
i ran in to see what in the world could have happened . 
i bought the item because of the name ,  as i ve been very happy with plantronics products in the past . 
i m still using this and been using it for weeks with no result . 
they have always been garbage and are still garbage . 
i bought these because they looked cute ,  and wasn t disappointed there ,  they are cute . 
might cause some problems with geforce num_num cards . 
i suspect a lot of positive reviews are fake . 
num_num of the wooden blocks were badly damaged . this could be hazardous to my birds . 
a minute of additional cooking later ,  a check of the same hole read num_num f after num_num seconds . 
the pegs ,  instead of being long ,  are short and stubby . 
i wore them one day for a few hours and was very uncomfortable in them . 
price : this pack weight only num_num pound num_extend shipped to me by usps . 
i either got a bad bottle or this just doesn t do it for me . 
overall ,  i m glad he s gotten some enjoyment from this toy but i m glad i wasn t the purchaser . 
i bought three of these to replace the plastic cutlery rack in my dishwasher . 
i have had several band failures and a couple of pouch failures . 
it threw up all over the stove out the vent . 
however ,  the level design is such that you aren t forced to use it . 
i bought this as a gift for my neighbor as he is a huge pirate fan . 
i did num_num more consecutive applications hoping to build the color ,  but i never built up any color . 
they didn t even ask for upc ,  expiration date ,  code number ,  where i bought it ,  nothing . 
i have tried it with several phones and it will not connect . 
this is the first time i have been let down by amazon with a incorrect description . 
the logitec was by far better in both cases ,  yet still not good enough for vr . 
its tiny about hald the size of my smallest isle . 
she thought it was just to set it in . 
now ,  i await the return of another cover . 
i turned it on for the first time and it stays on high . 
i have been in the market for a paraben free deoderant and have been using this for num_num months . 
thankfully i ve always had a friend with an alternate filtration source to save the day . 
glamazons ,  the only reason i gave this num_num stars is because of the low price tag . 
if i didn t use enough ,  my hair was still frizzy . 
is like a bad episode of digimon or power rangers . 
i am so irritated with this vendor i cannot even express . 
i even read a few of the reviews on amazon . 
the dmso is tested upon arrival to the us to strict guidelines prior to manufacture into msm . 
i hope that the smaller canisters hold out longer ,  as other reviewers mentioned . 
i am disappointed  ,  to say the least with ,  with this product . 
it is hard to wash out of your hair and ,  off your hands . 
you couldnt cut num_num cord if your life depended on it . 
num_extend day i went to shoot to zero this ,  after one shot ,  the light went off . 
when i rated my product for feedback ,  i let the company who sent it out know . 
the ball seems to get stuck at the joints . 
maybe try putting it in hot bath water . 
after using it for a period of two months it did not make any difference in my cholesterol level . 
but when i m listening to music or a podcast ,  it doesn t . 
it s divided where you can t see all of the wrestlers in the game . 
and the screen seems way too small to fit the impossibly insane amount of things going on . 
this game has ok graphics for today s first person shooter standard . 
i don t understand why this brand has so many loyal followers . 
i had ordered a couple of accessories with the phone . 
while the information says six to eight weeks ,  that s actually how long it takes for them to process it . 
they were completely dried ,  but still had a chewy texture to them . 
i was hoping this product would help but it doesn t ,  plus it is very pricey !  it s just ok . 
but today ,  there is no other brand that makes minidisc . 
not recommended for anyone ,  even if the size of the boxes wasn t a problem for you . 
i just get a harsh plain old vinegar taste that makes my mouth pucker . 
green mountain has great coffee but this stuff really sucks !  . 
if you dont have an overwhelming sweet tooth ,  don t purchase these . 
next morning when i checked ,  all the air in the can was gone . 
it is hard to hold on to and scrub the vegetables at the same time . 
this mass gainer mixes terribly in a shaker cup . 
so with flavor ,  texture ,  packaging ,  variety ,  and brand ,  they are fantastic . 
however ,  due to the taste ,  i d almost rather drink the soda . 
itwas so doughy . if they putany rum in it must have usedan eye dropper . will never buy again . 
not what i expected but i will keep it and give it a try . 
they have a note saying that the computer will say it is not charging ,  when it actually is . 
probably the worst fitting shoes i have purchased in years . 
i am not sure if it was from amazon shipping or from ups . 
i was really jazzed about my purchase of the braun num_extend
my review is against the description ,  not against the product ,  which i have not used . 
this could be a fine product ,  but i think the quantity they want you to take is too much . 
i have combination skin so a moisturizer was just what i was looking for . 
they re desperate and trying to catch a break which i understand . 
but you can spend a little extra for a knife made in the u . s . 
little disappointed at first because i didn t get a case with mine . 
it dyed my fingers pink after just a couple hours !  !  i took it off . 
it is an heavy alcohol mask which gives you teary eyes while you are waiting for it to dry . 
this product needs to be taken off the shelves . 
put the magnet back like it belongs ,  and fiddled some more . 
these haven t done a darn thing for my children . 
the headdress is adorable and comes with beautiful gemstone in it . 
john chambers should be ashamed of himself for allowing cisco to release such a shoddy product . 
well ,  this is the case for me with this particular perfume . 
i paid about $ for the beehive ,  and i love it more than ever now . 
wanted to love this stuff but it was just ok . 
i used it about five times before i just gave up and finally just put the darned thing away . 
i had one brand name bamboo cutting board that lasted me three years before splinters appeared . 
i did not even try ,  i had one before that was snap on ,  much easier . 
i don t want to hold my hand over hot oil for num_extend seconds if i can avoid it . 
as promoted ,  this item is suggested for use with binoculars . 
i had to force the thing to move . 
the bubbles won t go away no matter how hard i push the screen . 
now i am stuck with num_num of them . 
so ,  over time ,  she ll have tartar problems as evidenced on her teeth . 
i hope other cat owners who have these problems would try wilderness and see if it helps their cat . 
so there is honestly not much you can throw at me as naysayers . 
this is about the size of a trial or travel sized product . 
the moment i put this bra on ,  i knew it wasn t fitting me correctly . 
i bought this to use at home since my reception is shaky . 
it s sad for me to give effaclar k two stars . 
do you best not to over feed them . 
other complaints ,  how about luminescent markers that don t glow . 
worst of all ,  it does absolutely nothing to moisturize . 
unfortunately my doubts have so far been confirmed . 
i then lightly sprayed several coats on and then immediately took off all tape . 
i own this product and based on my personal experience ,  they are not that great . 
i just can t think of anything good to say about this game . 
it gets too hot and is hard to handle without burning myself . 
unfortunately ,  i did not read the amazon reviews before buying this router  from another source  . 
still i didn t expect the product to be harmful to your ears . 
i m always on the hunt for new teas other warm beverages ,  so i m glad i got to try this . 
would not recommend to anyone who is looking to wear these for a long period of time . 
the most disappointing part has been the lack of padding . 
i have a boston terrier puppy that literally will chew on everything .  .  . but not these . 
it received stellar reviews here on amazon so i thought it was an easy buy also considering the price . 
i was excited to see that it lit up when i plugged it in . 
i wish i would have never bought this but hopefully i get a new one soon . 
it was flushable ,  which was great ,  but that was about the only plus . 
i had been looking for a good fm tuner to use with my creative nomad jukebox zen xtra . 
so if you get a clump of grass ,  you ve got to mow it twice . 
i bought it since the price temporarily dropped . 
i am very unhappy ,  becouse you cant return it . 
refueling from a fuel bottle is messy and dangerous always with extraneous spilled fuel in the neighborhood . 
i also liked the weaponry that jak gets to use . 
the can ,  slim with a normal soda can height ,  contains num_extend oz . 
i like this company s black and strawberry licorice ,  but the black cherry flavor wasn t there with this stuff . 
i had high hopes ,  but this toy was a big disappointment . 
but ,  they d work great for little bitty fingers . 
i am still looking for a decent eyelash curler . 
i should have returned this product the minute it doesn t look right to me . 
the charger doesn t work and doesn t appear to be designed for these batteries . 
this is only num_extend whereas most are num_extend
my wife actually one of these and paid for it in october . 
the battery is outfitted with an onboard power indicator . 
he said he would keep them but not to order them again . 
this is not the case with this knife . 
how do you have any idea how much you re going to pay . 
this might not be a bad game but i will not buy something i can only install num_num times . 
i may have purchased this item before it was ready . 
the material is rough and uncomfortable to wear . 
after reading the reviews i was hoping it would help my redness out aswell . 
i bought this in the hope i would not have to turn off the canister or aeration devices . 
i probably could have salvaged the things with a new elastic . second item from champion that was not so good . 
i don t hate or like this product ,  but it hasn t benefit meand i wouldn t purchase it in the future . 
i wish that it showed what tablet it goes to because it does not fit the tab num_extend
i did order a ring and num_num weeks later it is still in one piece . 
it looks good but the practical functionality ends there . 
all in all ,  don t bother with this toy . 
if they last to that point ,  they ll probably last a long time . 
i m super happy with the koss portapro ,  but not all that happy with these . 
the kind of tired that reassures you that you gave it a great effort . tuesday :  received the product . 
since others seem satisfied ,  i guess i just got a lemon . 
it simultaneously has low gain yet no sound isolation . 
you cannot add more than one number per entry  eg . 
now what ?  the box was huge ,  there are tons of pieces . 
the fuzzy screens will plague your hardware where there should be none . 
i gave it two stars for the quality ,  it s well made but not for me . 
i would strongly suggest shopping around for a better quality box . 
the texture of the brownies and the ease of prep is terrific but this particular flavor is awful . 
yes ,  it makes light and can be mounted on a bicycle . 
i did not . i will never try another product from this company . 
anyway after adjusting it for a while to my satisfaction ,  i tried to lead my cat around . 
i have num_num of these num_extend that are good for nothing . 
worked perfect ,  sending out a thousand bubbles a minute . 
you also dont need to charge it via the induction pad ,  but can . 
you choose a default deck and take it into  battle  as you try to move across england . 
it s num_extend long ,  num_extend wide ,  and num_extend tall . 
i really don t like it enough ,  that i will not drink any more of it . 
if you don t spray enough solution ,  then you re not really cleaning the floor . 
and another clock in the house is always handy . 
these wipers require replacing the entire wiper component ,  not just the plastic part . 
the first one also failed within a year . 
the second reported drive failing on their diagnostics utilities . wd is no saint either . 
the two items along with shipping came to about $
for what they market it as ,  it seems to miss some marks . 
so i thought this might be a good item to take with me on my bike tour . 
they refused to exchange it for a model that works . 
another terrible story is also when i was making risotto . 
the butter was packed into two num_num oz plastic tubs . 
in my case my failure rate was % in both cushions that i bought through amazon . 
the other two lasted a couple weeks each . 
but users of pvr software keep their machines up and running num_extend
i couldn t believe it !  i was cool to look as while it lasted though . 
this has to be by far the worst gamecube game ever made . 
it completely shut down and the happy green power light turned into an angry blinking red . 
i was in the military so i knew that they told me i was o+ . 
sony isn t withholding information ,  but there are details they aren t telling you . 
that was my own experience ,  and all other reviews i read indicated the same . 
that they play fast ,  this one doesn t even have . 
i have a different model kodak camera ,  however they all use the same easyshare software . 
it s expensive but they are both relatively very expensive . 
after about num_num months ,  my phone began freezing up ,  especially when the battery was low . 
it was deep enough to snag my fingernail . 
at this moment ,  i just gave up .  .  . screw this company ,  screw their products . 
waste of money after seeing the specs on this . 
you know why ?  it s so you can spend the money you saved on batteries . 
but i guess what makes you feel good is what your gonna get . 
i think the claims they make are mostly hype . 
it s  logitech  more responsive ,  comfortable ,  accurate ,  better feel ,  better look . 
they would last about a day and a half and i would find the dispenser completely empty . 
it seems these bluetooth devices don t last very long . 
i bought the quiver and at no time it broke and it keeps on falling off the cross bow . 
it s quite attractive and plenty of room for my two winter white hamsters . putting it together took a little work . 
i returned it the same day i bought it . 
larynx bits .  .  . and the rest ,  as you know ,  hooves . a variety bag with little variety and poor quality . 
the fabric is ugly ,  cheap ,  does not sit tightly on the pad ,  looks awfully cheap ,  loosing . 
if you don t use them ,  the points can last a long time . 
too much vitamin b cause my skin to break out  :   . 
i wouldn t suggest relying on it to clean your ears out from wax cause it wouldn t for me . 
took a long time to get the case . 
it didn t do anything for my natural thick hair nor it relieved the itch from my scalp . 
the taste is good and make a wonderful sprinkle topping on ice cream . 
it worked well with one brand in a large size can . 
and i felt horrible trying to get them to take all of it . 
so i m not some noob that doesn t know how to apply these things . 
the smell is rather strong and sweet ,  which is mostly what i didn t care for . 
i have emailed them numerous times and they are not responding . 
i bought two flavored coffees but they are way too bold and strong for a morning coffee drinker . 
if after trying this horrible stuff you think you don t like protein shakes . 
never did work as far as the part that is supposed to pry off vacuum sealed lids . 
perhaps it s because they are unsulfured ,  i don t know . 
you ll either love the super strong smell or hate it . 
this coffee is stale ,  expired ,  with no expiration date on the package . 
it just didn t win us over at all . 
don t experiment with this right before some important event or you ll be sorry . 
very disappointed !  the only thing this product does is get my year and a half old sheltie angry . 
if not for the those side effects ,  i would have stayed with this . 
to anyone who may like these ,  i am sorry to learn about your hearing disability . 
this really isn t right ,  especially because it says this right on the box itself . 
i am a programmer by trade and i sit for num_extend hours a day . 
i looked online for a way to repair it and tried to get a hold of customer service . 
it s built specifically for generic fishing ,  possibly off a pier . 
the cord is only num_extend long but i d rather have surge protection and widely spaced outlets . 
so ,  i went to our local gourmet store ,  paid $ more and bought one there . 
i cleaned and prepped everything well and don t believe that to be the issue . 
don t waste your money !  maybe it wsan t legit . 
so they did the right thing ,  but the product still isn t very good . 
i think it s best to just get my rice at the store ,  now . 
the only good thing about is the theme music rocks . 
it worked okay for the first walk we took her on . 
i would happily subscribe if this were the regular homestyle . 
i m gonna keep looking though for the one that works right for me lol . 
if not for final fantasy ix switching gears ,  the franchise may have died from this title . 
got this for my four year old son . 
i have been diagnosed with both heel spurs and plantar fascia irritation that occurred because of the former . 
other than the marks ,  the case is good for the price . 
when i was cleaning it gently the glass came lose and now it just rattles around . 
the rollerballs do not dispense the product evenly and some gets in my eye at this point . 
if i was num_num i might find it fantastical but now i find it derrivative . 
a little louder in the high end but more distortion . 
once we had them ,  they just seemed to multiply . 
make your own is better ,  just junkmessy mess ,  gave it away after first trycheap ,  don t buy this thing . 
call it a low calorie num_extend cal  candy snack ,  and not a  fruit strip ,   and i have no problem . 
the cobraco num_extend expandable window planter is very small . 
the style and design is quite sexy ,  and if you have the confidence to rock it you re halfway there . 
i was so disappointed ,  and i should have just returned it ,  but instead ,  it s still sitting in my cabinet . 
a good knife should be sharp ,  of course . 
it s a nice design ,  but only good for very small dogs  like yorkies maybe  . 
boy ,  and i mean the title of my feelings about this game . 
when i think of a pedometer ,  i think of a device that measures walking distance . 
you cannot dock the phone while it is in the case . 
this is my num_extend day and fourth muffin and i honestly want to send back the box . 
i for one will not buy their products again . waste of money if you are buy this battery . 
however it does work as a great antioxidant . 
does it do it well ,  i would say it does ok . 
i paid num_num for them before they were on sale . 
and the coffee seems to get  bitter  rather quickly after brewing . 
turns out if it sits with backpressure on it it starts to stick . 
this is just a squirt of oil and shipping and handling should be a buck or two at most . 
i ll admit that i usually don t like cherry flavored things ,  but black cherry  like this drink  is usually ok . 
the boots are cute and the size num_num fits well ,  it s just that they are hard to put on . 
it was more like styrafoam ,  felt like a packing peanut . 
you can use a clean piece of cloth to clean your disk . 
i the color and the product if i was able to actually use it . 
but ,  watch out for lots of burned fingers ,  and the curlers also pop forward . 
i bought this for my num_num year old and even he finds it annoying . 
i almost got hit when the taillight went out . 
this is somewhat pricey for a detailing kit . 
please use extreme caution if you purchase these toys for kittens in particular . 
after six months of use my phone was became confused by the plastic screen on the front . 
oh well ,  you get what you pay for . 
even the least intelligent among us would soon figure out that that is a terrible deal for consumers . 
when i saw this advertised on tv ,  i thought it was a great idea . 
you have to zoom everything just to make on screen words less blurry . do not buy . 
other walden farms products are great ,  but this one is disgusting !  i couldn t get past a tiny taste . 
i do know its just taking to long . 
gave it another try and the case broke ,  snapped and was entirely useless . 
i ll update my review if i discover a better way of applying it . 
it s ok except the black paint flakes off right away . 
at % the leds are only getting about num_extend watts . 
the valves on the extra wide are totally different . 
the metal ring is keeps trying to come off this second one too . 
they are all black or dark brown ! id rather play maxpayne num_num or burnout num_extend
i was just happy to finally get a num_extend
if you use locktite on the screws then they will not loosen . 
microsoft is typically a frustrating experience to find support . 
however ,  this time almost all of the candies were in that condition . 
this one just seems like too much  hype  for the money . 
be sure and refridgerate !  i d only had these num_num big bags a short time before they were bad . 
it came off literally within minutes of taking it out of the packaging . 
eventually ,  i will probably cut the cable ends off and put new connectors on . 
specifically ,  the  liner lock  jams against the blade after opening . 
this was the worst dried fruit product i have ever had . 
it still has the wonderful catnip smell and attraction . 
not recommended for use with the clarisonic or by anyone with dry skin . 
if you can afford to go to the $ range go with the canon eos . 
he could topple it over when he was num_num months . 
it did make some of the green algae loosen from the rocks ,  making it easier to remove from rocks . 
it applies smooth ,  shines like crazy ,  and actually dries within the minute it claims to . 
i m not in a loud place ,  and these are not anywhere near  whisper  quiet . 
the ornament on the bike is actually not painted but rather slapped on with a sticky painted tape . 
i can t say enough about msr s whisperlite camp stove . 
she likes other interactive toys but not interested in this one . 
hartz makes many products  these included   which make small dogs num_extend lbs and less  very ill . 
guess that can be a good thing or a bad thing . 
the first time you sub the baking soda for shampoo ,  you might not love the results . 
i will preface my statement by saying i love my oster clippers and blades . 
the bulky design that doesn t nest completely means they take up too much drawer space . 
i m very good at baseball games ,  and i haven t beaten the cpu in about num_num games . 
it s better suited to the type of women who wear way too much makeup . 
it s a handsome machine endorsed by one of our favorite food tv chefs . 
i bought these  waterproof  boots to ride my motorcycle to work . 
overall i was very hopeful that this device would improve my pets water intake . 
i wish i knew what the rave is about this cologne . 
i m hoping he uses them soon ,  but so far he s not interested . 
i walked my dog in it and she did great . 
i will not be buying this toy again . 
the best example of rancidity is brown rice . 
that gave it a life span of num_num months before it became uusable . 
at the point you think it might hold ,  you are sure you ll break the tightening knob  using a leatherman  . 
after you recover from your brief wtf moment ,  you agree to call tech support . 
i wore it once and well ,  sorta tore the cup !  runneth over to a whole other level . 
i wasn t really ever happy with the product . 
as soon as i pulled the pans out of the dishwasher ,  rusted water started dripping from underneath the rim . 
 unless you are connected to a pc ,  wasting a usb port . 
it would always leave some almond chunks no matter how long i ground . 
when it arrived ,  i tried and didn t think it was all that special . 
yorkies naturally have silky hair and this shampoo made his hair the opposite . 
you die so easily in this game and body armor is hard to come by . 
some days it would flow and others not . 
it comes halfway down my bottom and looks very awkward . 
i have to admit i didn t even get past the first level . 
i tried useing it a couple of times and then went and bought a bluetooth . 
i m in need of another battery ,  but will look for another one if i have a choice . 
it is not my phone as it does it to other s as well . 
simply putting the computer to sleep and waking it won t work . 
the benzelaldehye in the product might be a health risk . 
i tried deleting all other downloaded apps ,  and even reset the phone ,  but it still has the same problems . 
for one ,  having to throw powder on your weapon to keep it from breaking is stupid . 
boy ,  were they wrong !  people returned the game in droves . 
i thought that would work better for voice dialing . 
onitsuka is in european sizes ,  but on the listing they show an inaccurate conversation into american sizes . 
the band fits really well around my wrist . 
i will stick with the small dog formula of a food where the first ingredient listed is meat . 
when i received this and read the package ,  the third ingredient is  artificial flavor  . 
they just mean more powerful existing weapons ,  which is kinda lame . 
her pulling has been reduced by at least % and the scar on her snout is disappearing . 
but i ordered them anyway and was just as disappointed as many others . 
i have ordered these things from all over the world . 
i didn t get it  right  the first time ,  but was able to reset . 
if they could overcome this ,  it would be a great unit . 
i ordered num_num of these and if i had a box big enough ,  would send them back . 
others have compared it to other products like snapple ,  crystal lite and arizona teas . 
grandprix num_num is simply one of the worst racing sim i have ever played . 
as soon as you pull on the iron the cord holder folds down . 
plus keeping a fax line open for num_num minutes is very difficult and often the fax transmission fails . 
even while sitting right there with them i wanted to wring its neck . 
tbd after i contact seller to see what they can do . 
back to the drawing board to find my husband a good mustache wax . 
i tried each and every one of them and one worked great ,  the other barely glowed . 
it is mainly a place to sit on the floor for stories and cuddles . 
i made me and another family member a sandwich . 
some things were a great idea; some sounded like a great idea but were horrible in execution . 
my mother had used one ,  and the name  presto  really meant something to me . 
the hole the frame screws into creates a stress point . 
i m so glad i found it for so much less than at my vet . 
i purchased this radio several years ago and found it to be a really fine performer . 
i thought maybe i could get used to it . 
i bought this product a few months ago and have been taking it very regularly . 
you can clearly see the live ones moving around . 
i m going to try another brand now as i m tired of returning these . 
my thighs and seat were under severe compression . 
using a wooden chopstock i gently rubbed it against the interior of the carafe . 
 it s not microsoft s job to support cbear s hardware ,  it s cbear s job to support their product . 
it s very mild gentle and smooth on the skin and smells very nice and did not make me breakout . 
i am small framed and my new size is num_extend but with swelling num_extend
i figured that was pretty good for the price paid . 
i compared it s speed with two other thermometers and it was far behind . 
my daughter accidentally slammed the plastic desk onto her fingers . 
i didnt expect much from it but was expecting more than it gave . 
the next day the applicator had dried out even after i had tightly closed it . 
i bought these blank cds to make some audio mixes with . 
the first test my son got was to spell  laugh .   i would not consider this a kindergarten level word . 
my daughters had no interest in this toy . 
save your money and look for something else . 
you like hallways ? if you can answer yes to that simple question ,  you ll love doom num_extend
this case has a nice smooth feel to it but was too big for my samsung num_extend
that was a bad decision on my part . 
i hate it and i definitely wouldn t recommend it . 
you have to  earn  your rating ,  so to speak . 
i have a few sets of speedo earplugs . 
maybe the battery was weak or wouldn t charge properly ,  but it certainly seemed ok . 
i bought this based on the reviews ,  and i wasn t impressed . 
i know there are excellent reviews on this crust . 
the whole package was extremely difficult to remove as well . 
i haven t washed it yet ,  but i will pretty soon . 
they re so small it s hard to tell what animal each one is at first . 
the lady that took them agreed the fabric was  stiff and scratchy  . 
it s been used for decades for skin protection and minor irritations ,  but its awfully pricey in this little tube . 
so when i place the phone on the table and walk away a short distance ,  i lose the music . 
inside was another plastic pouch with the slippers . 
i ended up returning the item and buying a used bellows and slide copier on ebay . 
wouldn t pay more than num_extend bucks for this thing . 
i find that it tastes a bit rotten . 
did not help my ibs at all; may have even worsened it . 
i ve never had an allergic reaction to a fabric before . 
well ,  as i always do ,  i wore them in the house for a few hours . 
the groves of this toy did not hold in the treats . 
he doesn t even want to smell the stuff . 
i kept getting an error code ,  and followed the instructions in the manual ,  to no avail . 
you can t swing a dead cat around without hitting some ammo for a duel wieldable weapon . 
it doesn t have the weight of the regular trains ,  and it won t roll along on our wood floors . 
i think she was turned off by the fact that it is not really a  carry around  doll . 
i don t like the way my scalp feels after using this . 
the shawl itself looked fine for a formal wedding . 
this foundation doesn t work for me ,  i must be sensitive to the ingredients . 
it tastes great and i love the energy . 
this product might be okay for dogs who like being in it . 
we have a female rott and this brush just didn t do it for us . 
it pretends it does ,  there s a sip setting but it does absolutely nothing . 
when i tried to push it back in place ,  it totally fell out . 
despite following the measuring instructions on the web page ,  the fit was awful . 
from reading other reviews it appears that these are hit or miss and that some work very well . 
my friends didn t like it either because it was so plain . 
and with a warranty that actually is relevant !  . warranty zerolemon guarantee compatible zl num_extend black num_extend
the same thing happened . seems like an unreliable unit they are trying to get rid of . 
suffice it to say that i ve really lost trust in both amazon and oneida . 
so i thought i d try this line of products . 
i now see all the others who have had similar experience from them in other reviews . 
can t imagine who would like these ,  unless you re really healthy and not used to pleasant eating . 
according to amazon . com s return policy ,  you cannot return worn items . 
we purchased this for our num_num year old daughter . 
i am num_num and i have just had stomach surgery . 
to make a long story short ,  i just got the num_extend one today . 
by then they were gray and without any searing like we get from the first gen model . 
very fuzzy ,  hard to get into car tape deck . 
i loved upgrading the gloves and cool sword . 
it is not as easy to use as other harnesses and it definitely does not discourage her pulling behavior . 
i was far more pleased with the activewraps . 
spend a little more and get something that works . 
however ,  since these do not really do the job ,  look elswhere . 
when this product first came out it really caught my eye . 
if you really need your cat to stop spraying ,  this will certainly not do the trick . 
on top of the protection ,  got the gloves run very small in size . 
first ,  it is not sharp enough ,  actually ,  this is an understatement . 
i hate to say i was really disappointed in this one . 
it is so sweet ,  it almost feels like a concentrate . 
i hope the num_extend will be much better than this ds that i wasted money on . 
the other doll delivers in every way . this doll here is about the quality of disposable mc . 
take a close look at the middle picture ,  you can see how rounded the tips are . 
around a month into ownership ,  my unit became unresponsive ,  no stopping ,  pausing ,  ff or ejecting dvd s . 
 and no ,  i do not work for greens+  . disclaimer :  i m not a nutritionist . 
put the yummy bag into the bag of ice . 
for all i know this thing could already be expired and i don t know . 
but when it arrived ,  we noticed instantly that we got a dud . 
eyeliners and such need extra scrubbing with this pad which really irritates the skin . 
when one lug would not rotate by hand onto the stud i tried it on several others without avail . 
the chargers are dumb ,  and continue charging ,  and overcharging will slowly damage the battery . 
especially because this train is a christmas toy . 
it s hard to get the cover off once you have fitted it with the phone . 
i can taste the ingredients through the thin capsule . 
if you run out of ammo in your gun though ,  it sucks lol . 
another stupid thing is the way your character walks . 
what can cause them to break ?  almost anything . 
we were hoping to find a brush that wouldn t add to the frizz . 
also ,  the package indicates that excessive consumption may cause a laxative effect . 
i didn t feel comfortable leaving kitty ,  as i was never sure the thing was going to work . 
they might work for you if you can get the right size . 
so you can hear your characters being attacked but can t see where to counter . 
hey you get what you pay for ,  and for less than $ that is exactly what get . 
this cup barely lasts one hour on heavy days . the only positive thing is that it s nice on light days . 
it is so small as to be of little use . 
if you intend to use it strictly for calls ,  i suspect the battery life will be much longer . 
it might be a good weapon ,  but not top of stove cookware . 
i tried restarting my laptop ,  reinstalling the drivers ,  etc . 
still a lot for that amount of food but that s the price of convenience . 
if you have fruit in the bowl and bananas ,  they don t hang . 
the elevator sticks so badly that my toddler cannot push it up by herself . 
i followed all directions :  fill half way ,  pump num_num times ,  hold upright ,  release pressure when not in use . 
i copied a num_extend directory from their c :  drive in num_num secs . 
the visuals mostly remind of the old nintendo num_extend
if it had a more simplified camera and controls ,  i d probably like it a lot . 
i ordered the gauge and the modified case for num_num win at the same time  another website  . 
it was cute ,  i will admitted that ,  but it was losing glitter way to fast . 
my son used it for an orchestra halloween concert but will probably never wear it again . 
tried to return but of course it says this item isn t returnable . 
a slider case that doesn t let the phone slide .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . pointless . 
ok idea but not much fun in the playing . 
i am very disappointed in the size of the tops and bottoms . 
i d advise everyone else to do the same . 
wonderful design ,  but my cats had no interest ,  no matter how i tried . 
batteries go dead really fast when turned off . 
the pny is one of the best chargers on amazon . 
my black bouvier de flanders gets crusty areas around her shoulders and sometimes on her head . 
the num_extend had a crease in the top left corner . 
i think that for the price ,  this is a good primer . 
most lcd monitors are difficult to read from that angle anyways . returned mine . 
i had way more trouble trying to insert and remove this than i have ever had with tampons . 
sorry i purchased so much of this product . 
please read my one star rating as zero . 
really not needed or better than just holding a knife . 
i intend to use these shorts for camping ,  hiking ,  and an upcoming disney world trip . 
even if you carefully center the tray when you start cooking ,  it s easy to bump it without realizing it . 
the high heat is medium and the medium heat is low . 
i got these in part because of the warranty . 
rack was kinda frustrating to get on and the instructions were not very clear at all . 
so you have to be crafty with placement . 
i was pretty disappointed considering how much i spent and inconvenient is was to store away . 
that ,  coupled with her highly food driven motivation ,  usually leads to her mastering these types of treat toys instantly . 
the pleather just flaked off and the belt strap pulled off so easily . 
i didn t expect to use it for that . 
i actually owned one of these and the bristles on it were cheaply made . 
i think i will try skindinavia next time . 
gets very boring and doesnt require intuitive or logical thinking on the part of the player . 
this is not a flaw in manufacturing ,  it s the way the box is designed . 
this thing broke on me after about the num_extend time i took it off . 
i also notices that he is more energetic and has a better appetite since i added this substrate . 
other reviews have stated that bumps will cause it to pop off . 
i got this from the perfumania sale after having it on my amazon wish list for ages . 
fortunately ,  we can look forward to this num_extend jar being phased out for the already introduced num_extend size . 
this has been going on for num_num weeks and the only change is the bag of food . 
also ,  when you buy this game ,  don t plan on playing it the same day . 
there is no way to delete this and recapture this waste of space . 
it does work with a hp num_extend ink jet . 
shortcuts are rarely quite as simple as them may seem in my experience . 
just be prepared for some frustrating times and make sure you update with the patch . 
i have heard that this kills your system and it does . 
it takes too much effort to remove the hair in my leg . 
you will sweat a lot but it s just water weight . 
the taste to me was too orangey and for a  natural  product it sure didn t taste like one . 
i was really excited to see this $ flat iron on sale for $
do i dare get a size up ,  or just stay braless and give up the hunt !  . 
the generators that spawn dozens of monsters are still there ,  but they create enemies with a magical flourish . 
but as for the other num_num times nothing has ever gone wrong . 
the stabilizer attachment does little to improve mobility of the ball . 
rugged ridge should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this unit to be sold with their name on it . 
on the other hand ,  the falcon ii is highly unpleasant . 
now ,  i am mostly just bored by civ num_extend
this is their num_extend model of this ?  clearly they should have left it alone . 
the bottom tray split in two ,  spilling out olive oil all over the place . 
if you are not a car person ,  these are going to be good enough for you ,  really . 
it has a really strong smell that is quite nauseating . 
i was actually looking for something i d had before . 
ohhh ,  you get to drive in a vehicle ,  been there done that in the num_extend and num_extend
i also had the misfortune of crawling on bat guano and maggots . stick with batteries and electric eels . 
nothing about the rings or packaging notate oster . 
i bought the travel size and the regular size . 
they are little tiny pieces more like flecks . 
and reduce fish consumption . one of the best natural scrubs recommended is baking soda . 
i m serious but this kinda made me laugh . 
also disconnects and other lockup issues are crippling to this game . 
i broke out the entire time i used it . 
i wouldnt buy another one of this model . 
they end up getting oily and messy because of the dripping . 
they are little rubber push buttons and the power button was worn right off it . 
however ,  i did receive a battery that i believe is fake . 
for me that s unacceptable . the blower feature works like a charm . 
wonderful !  now when you travel you pray that the thing isn t running when you go through airport security . 
please do not make your dog live in one of these outside !  !  ! they are flimsy and thin . 
i have a fighter with num_extend level repair and she still can t repair anything without breaking it . 
over the years ,  i ve gathered a number of different kitchen tongs . 
unless you re a hardcore fan of the title ,  don t get this game . 
its sitting in my pantry for now until i decide what i m going to do with it . 
okay i want to start off by saying this stuff stinks . 
it is still soothing ,  just not for as large an area as they make it seem . 
i bought this product from amazon . com and had to return it . 
the hair was out of control easily matted and way too bushy . 
they got me once ,  but they won t get me twice ! madmax . 
in just num_num months ,  the dog we were treating with the  cheap  products deteriorated rapidly . 
i wound up paying about the same for shipping as the product originally cost . 
the game is essentially telling you you failed at doing it correctly . 
i enjoyed the prequel to this game and went out on a $ limb to get this one . 
i guess you can t expect much for num_num bucks ,  but jeez !  last a little while ,  why doncha ?  . 
but my daughter is totally scared of it . 
i had to discard the printer and this cable . 
these are easily the worst i have seen . 
i m going to try it as a wash out conditioner and see if i like it any better . 
my dog is not really interested in it ,  since it takes so much work to get treats out . 
drive to the hoop ,  do a num_extend and reverse the ball in . 
i am no more able to explain this than the short unhappy life of the second pea plant . 
if there was a rating lower than num_num star ,  i would give it . 
such treats should not be handled by pregnant women ,  the very young ,  the elderly or the immunocompromised . 
however ,  the tiny motor is not good quality . 
liked the color of this hat ,  buuuuuut ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  once again not made with enough material . 
this is true even when the valve stem is fully inserted into the pump head . 
you really pay for the fact that it s hello kitty . 
a restart usually solves this ,  but i keep shouting  why ,  why ,  why  every time i have to . 
they good for a month ,  not sure what they cost . 
my hands especially need extra care when it s cold . 
a sudden increase in the weight is observed after drinking muscle milk . 
you do num_num levels , city , ruins ,  and i cant even remember the other one because its so stupid . 
spend thirty cents more and buy a bottle of mccormick vanilla extract . 
the quality of this product was much poorer than i expected . 
this is great because he has kidney issues . 
i was impressed by the laser and after reading some of the reviews had hopes . 
it is a waste of money go for higher models . 
i would recommend buying a more expensive brand . 
even though the name has not changed from previous version of the product; firmware and chipset has changed . 
remember ,  moving to one side of the apartment building to the other is a major chore in itself . 
installed a different model linksys card in about num_num minutes with no problems . 
these are skin tight on my thighs and seat . 
i purchased these a couple of years ago and they only lasted a few months . 
this is what she chose . the end result :  these things are basically cheap garbage . 
it is difficult to use and takes several attempts at each hair . 
it s clearly not loud enough for num_extend ozone gas :  second ,  it might even be harmful to run this . 
i cook  and especially grill  with high heat ,  so i crank this when cooking steaks or other meats . 
i know several people with the original droid and mentioned how quickly the quality diminish . 
yes ,  it got terrible reviews about the gameplay . 
curly pudding is a lovely lilac color and it smells sweet ,  but those are the only positives . 
turn the sheath upside down and the knife falls out . 
my daughter loves it and you never have a waste of paint because it uses water . 
virtually impossible to carry in your pants pocket due to the sharp edges . 
i ve lost a lot of respect for them after this fiasco . 
i reccomend the fat num_extend because it has sliding disc tray and iy is sooooo better . 
plain and simple ,  these don t see to last . 
the item described a set of utensils ,  fork ,  knife ,  and spoon . 
nevertheless ,  it is made of good quality material . 
great looks ,  but almost half of them didn t work or broke after a couple hours of playing with it . 
i knew she wasn t thrilled with the collar but thought it was just puppy reluctance . 
however ,  when the peppers arrived at the house ,  the ingredients included sugar . 
ascetically the shoe was very pleasing to look at but my foot inside of it was not . 
i have never experienced this before with a probiotic . 
num_extend buffer is just half of the size than other num_extend burner . 
we need to read labels when we shop ,  to ensure that we are getting what we actually want . 
they are well made ,  my dog hated them . 
supposedly ,  they re making the  real  burnout num_num for the num_extend
i won t be buying it again ,  it s very very overpriced and not worth it . 
but otherwise ,  the straps are twisted and mangled ,  in the first use . 
i saw all the wonderful reviews of this product and ordered it . 
i did not feel that this made any positive impact on my hair at all . 
i ordered the screen protectors ,  with promises to receive them within a week . 
did it cost more ?  no question ,  a few bucks more . 
but i guess you get that you pay for . 
after trying all combination of tvs and antennas ,  this is by far the worst performer . 
now there is a short in the wire and the sound cuts in and out . 
but does it help so good ?  ?  ?  ?  no ,  not really . 
i will stick to non toxic and good quality controlled foods for my dogs . 
i bought these cause i m a chocolate snap lover ,  and i had been craving some . 
if you grate at lower speed ,  it really does not do a good job ,  plus it takes much longer .

when you finally manage to cut hair ,  you will notice that it simply doesnt cut it close enough . 
they can walk across the room just fine without falling on their own but with this they fall . 
so rather then being nice to your people just start building . 
this pump is cheap ,  comes with no gauge ,  and is unreliable at higher psis . 
one star for the mixer ,  one star extra for amazon s good return policy . 
this game is good too and you have to find the right way to get to the next level . 
required that the fur be cut in order to get the pet free from the toy . 
the only good thing about this product is that it is very nutritious . 
the dam level on  teenage mutant ninja turtles  . 
the third bottle i received had thinner shampoo and smelled just okay . 
ok ,  so you have to deal with a cord . 
i would not recommend purchasing this corn popper . 
maybe i got a bad bottle or something ,  but it looked horrible . 
i almost returned it because of this but got used to shooting it . 
buy only compact flash compatible products . after your camera dies your memory will live on with other compact flash products . 
the occasional  popping  of the resins sends small ,  extremely hot ,  burning particles flying in all directions . 
good enough crunch ,  but when it came to taste .  .  . we found these lacking . 
likes the whole set in general and plays with it everyday . 
however ,  my most recent color ,  red ,  faded horribly within the first week . 
a very worthy pedal ,  unfortunately overlooked by many . pro co num_extend great dirty distortion pedal . 
i do not like these cases because they are not sturdy enough ,  they come off very easily . 
when my skin finished shedding ,  i was left with patches of orange peel textured skin . 
this mascara lengthens kind of but spreads lashes well . 
we ordered this for my num_num year old min pin who was recently diagnosed with prostate cancer . 
many thanks for taking the time to submit a review . 
i am also bothered by the fact that this company chooses to manipulate the customer review system . 
not cool considering i ran it through a wall . today s lesson :  test your cords before running them . 
but since one is the lowest ,  that is what it gets . 
the large blades regularly had to be washed because they were taking so much dirt out of the air . 
it seems the same thing happened to another reviewer . 
i tried nutrafin cycle ,  and then tetra safestart . 
battery cover doesn t  snap  in place ,  it just slides up over the battery . 
this nail polish did dry fast  within two minutes  ,  with lots of shine and a perfect smooth texture . 
the muzzle appears to be new ,  but it did not come in a package  as pictured on website  . 
bought this for my grandfather who has bad arthritis in the knees . 
this is a horrible game ,  average graphics ,  bad controls , and unrealistic . 
i purchased this product from radio shack for my girlfriend who has used it for about a year . 
we sent it in to the samsung facility in jersey . 
i bought the complete kit ,  unfortunately it did not work . 
 rough ,   is probably the best word to describe it . 
it s just not a sweet taste ,  and that was what i expected . 
that is not the expected behavior with indian cookers . 
i have not been able to find a heart rate monitor that works properly yet . 
unfortunately ,  it brought nothing else to the table . 
i had a hard time washing away the shampoo after putting it in my hair . 
i feel this is a design flaw . i only needed this num_num times in a little over a year . 
can t say anything good about this product yet because the one i ordered showed up with broken glass . 
very pretty but had to return because on clasp wouldn t latch . 
amazon reviews have not been helpful ,  so i m going to expand my search . 
definitely not worth the few dollars you spend on them . 
this spray has no glossing agent or fruit wax like it claims . 
and it s so easy to put away . one night ,  i chopped some garlic ,  wonder of wonders . 
when i view my order this link with the changed picture is in it . 
the poor visuals inside these buckets of bolts only compound an even greater problem . 
i got as far in the game as i could without using these two steps . 
there are no puzzles ,  nothing in particular to unlock except new battles ,  and very little sense of progress . 
doesn t matter how many times i power cycle the computer and rhapsody . 
it s cute and the colors are very pretty but i am returning it . 
usb is everywhere and this saves you from having to use up your controller batteries . 
this is not ,  i repeat ,  not a football game . and third . 
again ,  you can tell how much i didn t like this game . 
do not buy unless you want a low quality mass produced cover that offers little protection . 
now inferior does not necessarily mean bad for you .  .  . but i didn t want to take the chance . 
the product description did say single stack right ?  so disappointing . 
these kept returning a negative result even though i knew i was in ketosis and ketostix confirmed that . 
the controls are not responsive ,  making fight sequences tedious . 
this is the one lee product i am disspointed in . 
at least it was this nice monster cable one . 
and for almost $ it is simply outrageous . 
i used it on my wrists and knee . 
keep in mind most of these cards are older than time spiral . 
unfortunately ,  the cuisinart rice cooker is an exception to the rule . 
i can t even sit num_num hours with this humming . 
sad to say the pros of this game really arent pros at all . 
i dont understand how these have gotten such high reviews . 
not even worth my time to send it back . avoid !  . 
i bought this after reading all the positive feedback . 
thats the best part of the game ,  getting rid of it . 
like all of these that i have owned over many years ,  it is loose . 
i guess i will get to learn with this one !  . 
they are expensive ,  about five bucks for two on amazon ,  external site ,  or ebay ,  but they look pretty classy . 
i cannot in good faith recommend this food . 
i purchased this phone thinking i was getting a good deal because the reviews nooooo just run now . 
cat tried playing with it with no luck . 
if we were ,  we could tell the difference . 
if my daughter hadn t been crazy about it i would have returned it a while ago . 
this product feels cheap and not like other cleansing oils . 
he says that they make a great snake for him and his college friends . 
plus ,  there didn t seem to be enough crackers for the amount of tuna you get . 
the first one was good ,  but the water reservoir kept leaking . 
well ,  i enjoyed this for about a month ,  until it broke . 
got hit with shipping and restocking charges when i returned it . 
it s turning itself off and on during the keep warm phase ,  which other reviewers say happened before theirs died . 
the nail stregthener is suppose to be clear ,  mine has a yellow tint to it . 
did nothing but gave me a headache and made me pretty irritable all day . 
i bought num_num of these things about a year ago with the intention of learning to use them . 
i own a ton of other ka products and haven t had near this disappointment . 
i had one as a kid in the eighties and i just loved it . 
semichrome lid requires an inconvenient pry tool to remove ,  ,  ,  , which tends to clobber lid causing it to not seal well . 
let me state right away :  graphics in a wwe wrestling game mean absolutely nothing to me . 
at least the new at rent has a pen with it which is a plus . 
i lost weight when i stopped using it ,  it also caused bloating . 
i was very disappointed i never got to try them in chicken and dumplings . 
years ago i used the original waterpick and it was mighty powerful and effective . 
my landlord will not let me drill or install the cable . 
neat idea with retractable cord ,  but num_num pin does not stay attached to charge port ,  does not charge phone . 
i thought melissa and doug was a great brand name ,  and that s why i ordered them . 
the cereal seems to have the right amount of sweetness ,  but the flakes are too hard . 
with that being said ,  we still have had two failed motors and now a failed main board . 
buy some dice ,  a figure and paper for a real roleplaying game . 
i like a strong bold cup and therefore usually brew the darker roasts . 
not fun . individual parcels of land don t seem to be anymore valuable than any other parecls of land . 
i ll probably use it up only because it cost so much ,  but i won t be ordering it again . 
it is way watery and i now only use it when i run out of my mac eyebrow gel . 
i think this was returned by another customer as defective ,  and it was sent right out again to me . 
just about everything they could do wrong .  .  . they did wrong . 
when he pulled his head out ,  the lid would just hang around his neck . it didn t work for us . 
buying a pack of the cheap lighters for less money has more butane than this tiny can . 
and theres boxes that you open and they turn into enemys !  yuck !  . 
my face got much worse !  redder and break outs . 
they train and train and accomplish nothing just like some other people are saying . 
guess i will stay with the tablets i had been using . 
i consider mod :  rising sun to be the worst . 
these lowrey s bacon curls are so hideously bad ,  i wanted to scrub out my mouth with a washcloth . 
so for five days now ,  i ve been wearing them . 
i tried all kinds of things and none really worked . 
i realize it s super cheap but it should last a month . 
i train mma ,  muay thai ,  and jiu jitsu . 
the instructions indicated it was for my phone but it did not fit . 
trying to saw a branch ,  it must have gotten too hot . 
there were ingredients listed that i didn t know were food . 
my hair felt so disgusting after using this . 
the charging dock is virtually useless to me now . 
do you know how many glitches ,  bugs ,  and excruciating errors i found while playing this game ?  hundreds . 
i can t imagine anyone looking forward to eating these . 
and they are not made in the usa . 
but ,  after a few moments with the instructions and some trial and error ,  this one isn t that bad . 
i ve begun looking for a less expensive alternative to starbucks or pete s coffee . 
that and the obstacle rooms kept me slogging through the frustrating parts . 
he had me try a bite and it tasted like burnt $ tires . 
to make a long story short .  .  . it was purchased as a birthday gift . 
they are extremely short and have the big head to it . 
after deciding to return the unit i talked to customer service about deleting my account information . 
so unless you re either as lazy as me ,  i would not recommend walking in any of these slippers . 
is it somehow okay when it s dried out and sold num_extend
finally ,  the thumb wheels on the side of the radio are awkward to use . 
the best part about it was the packet of wendy s saltines that i added . 
at how much i spent for junk that does absolutely nothing but empty your wallet . 
waste of five bucks as i have plenty of toys that make regular squeaks . 
i had to use a knife to pry the suction loose . 
all the reviews lookes so promising but it was just not for my cat . 
shame on diamond for its awful ingredient and on amazon for its crummy packaging and shipping . 
the centrum silver multivitamin for num_extend did not dissolve as i expected and caused stomach cramps and pains . 
nice design ,  i liked it for the three weeks it held together . 
don t even buy this ,  save your money for a hover steamer . 
overall :  i cringe when i think about eating this stuff ever again . 
ea sports really needs to control the lag time for online play ,  which is basically unplayable . 
i could not get the protector to go on without lots of bubbles . 
not very good chocolate and you had to really use your imagination to taste any strawberry flavor . 
i ve used it twiceand will not use it again . 
these caps were less money at my local harley dealer too . 
moving comfort makes great sports bras in general ,  but the sizing seems off on this model . 
to be honest ,  i don t feel like this product does much . 
i got excited ,  found it on amazon and bought it . 
so this one may not be able to handle it . i ll try it with some creamy eyeliner . 
contacted the seller first ,  and was written off initially . 
a link had to be removed each time we wanted to put it on or take it off . 
well this one just come with a permanent fixed belt attachment . 
they are still obsessed with our cell phones . 
no complaints at all about that . lastly ,  the gummi bears  no corn syrup ,  no gluten ,  no gmo s ,  whatever those are  . 
if the ipad is charged in .  .  .  . but i am using it ,  it still runs down with this cord . 
usually i agree with other s reviews on products ,  but not these date crumbles . 
don t bother buying this ,  but do buy forever new soap products . 
survivor has been one of my favorite television shows since it debuted nearly two years ago . 
i bought this linksys adapter for an apple emac whose ethernet port had been zapped by a lightning strike . 
i ll try to get my money back from buy . com . 
there ,  the conversations ,  were short ,  sweet and straight to the point . 
plus ,  the fountain itself quickly became dirty and needed cleaning . 
i didn t really care for the taste so i still have most of them left . 
they eat rabbits ,  mice ,  deer ,  ducks ,  anything with blood hair ,  feathers ,  teeth ,  bones . 
it just doesn t seem like a beauty line for me . may be because i am a loyal fan of philosophy . 
information showing highway exits ,  services , and poi s are old and not up to date . 
i was hoping this would increase my breast milk supply . 
i forgot to review the precision xl after i received it ,  so i m doing it now . 
i won t be buying any more progressive international microwave cookware . 
two weeks ago ,  one of the num_extend just died . 
while the aroma is good ,  the taste left me wondering what they use to flavor this stuff . 
i was really hopeful that this would be true . 
where others could get num_num films out of it i can only get three . 
i ve fgound the cure for drinking too much coffee inthe morning . 
i like the quality ,  and protection of the otterbox commuter case but dislike the slippery back outer case . 
all of those brands contain real ,  whole meats that i myself would eat ,  with no added fillers or corn . 
i can t imagine that just mineral drops could taste that bad . 
the cover doesn t lock closed ,  the cd doesn t stay locked in and num_num of the first num_num were broken . 
the sega cd was not successful ,  although it s agreed that it does have a decent library of games . 
my cats have had thier collars on for num_num weeks and are scratching just as much . 
when you scrub it shreds the tissue and leaves the tissue in balls all over your face . 
very disappointing product ,  and not worth the cost . 
either way ,  the handle was extremely fragile making the knife not worth my money . 
i have a male dog and don t want a pink bowl . 
they are extremely narrow ,  and were not helpful support . 
i got the wrong charger sent to me . 
our kid likes to play with this ,  so on the toy front it is great for enjoyment . 
i read an offical review about how bitter this stuff was and i had to agree . 
i ll review that one when i have more time . 
it could be the type of dog she is . 
i disconnected and reconnected it twice thinking i must have done something wrong . 
i really wanted a fast and furious shooter that took place within the star wars universe . 
pretty cover until you put it on a black iphone . 
apparently ,  there is an additional adaptar you can purchase to make it fit . 
well ,  i tried this product and my cats barely touched it . 
 praise the company !   your blood is boiling as you read this ?  goood !  i hope so . 
when i received ,  i found a broken hole on this brand new shirt . 
i threw it out after having it in my car for num_num minutes . 
it s a crap shoot getting a pair to fit . 
sims anything sells like hotcakes and ea realizes this . 
i have heard people returning it to factory num_num or num_num times and lens still come back bad . 
they need to come up with more pliable softer material . 
if you don t have the first game ,  then get it instead . 
then i placed it on a dry towel on the kitchen counter . 
even with the hair very damp ,  they keep coming unrolled . 
right now all the pieces are in a heap in a corner of his room . 
i very well could have just put a piece of cloth on my head for a hat . 
no go . my other complaint about this product is that it doesn t auto install drivers .  .  . it s not user friendly . 
i ve already tossed mine in the rubbish bin . 
so sad .  .  . for the cats and for my pocketbook . 
and the tingling to the scalp was not pleasant ,  but it wasn t horrible . 
i will use it as a water mister for my plants filling it only with water . 
so i am no novice to this . god bless you all who are trying so hard to get well . 
this purchase was to replace an old lux timer that had served me well . 
it wasn t heavily used ,  only about num_num times at most and i m well under the maximum weight of num_extend
beware !  the bowl looks like it would work well if it wasn t so small ,  returning . 
tested on a battery tester too and it concurred . 
one thing i will say is this adapter randomly decideds which xp computers it wants to work on . 
it s not as if i have a butt screaming to escape my jeans . 
this doll was at the top of my daughter s christmas list . 
i wish i would have checked the reviews here first before purchasing . 
i wish i had never bought this and glad i didn t spend more than i did on it . 
the bass for me sounds ok but the mids and highs sound dead . 
num_extend for the snes game looked and played about num_extend better than the original arcade version . 
i can no open it with back teeth and a lot of force . 
it also has a really nasty smell which i couldn t stand so in the garbage it went !  !  !  . 
without the device ,  i can get to the internet  albeit at an unsatisfactory speed  . 
i suppose u get what u pay for . 
i just wiped it off my dog with a wet wipe . 
this makes operation difficult ,  especially when riding ,  especially with gloves . 
i cannot stand the ache in my stomach . 
i have used polar products for many many years but this hrm was not as described . 
another thing is the battery ,  num_num hours and it s dead . 
the num_extend doesn t work well for this game . 
on to why i gave it a low rating . 
this smaller board warped after one run in the dishwasher . 
the controls feel unresponsive when you have to make quick moves . 
i also read that people bought these and they are not waterproof . 
that is the best tweezer i ever used . 
i have been able to stand doing half scoop mixed with protein powder . 
next time i visited i spent num_num hours trying to get this to work . 
first ,  the voiceovers made me want to both laugh and scream . 
my mom hasn t seen any diffrence from taking these and i have two words of warning for you . 
you really don t know how much you need that option until you don t have it . 
the mud match was obviously tossed in the game to attract buyers . 
if you re thinking  red , white ,  yellow  or  three prong  or  standard  then look elsewhere . 
all they do is make my feet sweat . 
simply no result at all . i will not recommend it to anybody unless a doctor prescribe it . yolitatx . 
i hope my review is helpful to you in determining which grill is best for you . 
next week i installed a new line and made absolute sure that i was trimming grass and not dirt . 
baking soda is pretty cheap no matter the brand . 
when it arrived to my house ,  i took it out of the package and was disappointed . 
sometimes its almost more convinient just using the buttons . 
i used this a handful of times with my samsung num_extend
as they want you to co e back !  . 
note that the  other ingredients  are all the fillers and junk that they put in the tablets . 
these have to quite possible be the worst bluetooth device i have ever used . 
these tasted like they d burned and then been packaged and sold . 
i tried larger string  comes with num_extend and i tried num_extend and found no difference in performance . 
these scissors have no sharpness and are a waste of money . 
and the options for dressing the sets with props are almost impossible to use . i ve restarted the game twice already . 
what a great deal !  i bought these not to use exclusively ,  but to use in addition to going outdoors . 
i also had a coupon for ulta for $ off a $ purchase . 
had i been able to interest cats in a harvey wallbanger i would ve been better off . 
it was ivory in color and had a slightly different texture from the yellow butter . 
they make smaller sizes ,  but why limit yourself . 
i have to say i was disappointed with this sample . 
we purchased this for our num_num month old westie to use in the crate . 
don t buy these if you expect to do a lot of outdoor walking in them . 
quite possibly the worst towel i ve ever used . 
the decibel level of this product is unacceptable . 
but in the car it is very much affected by the environment . 
the look is nice but the fit is totally uncomfortable . 
this puzzle would be great if it were made well . 
after num_num weeks with no reply ,  i filled out an amazon return form . 
i did not want my washer permanently fragranced with this strong artificial scent . 
there is quite a bounce back when you get hit . 
i buy all my games and never have pirated any . concerned customer ,  concerned future . 
it didn t shrink ,  the color just washed out and it turned green . 
i now use it under another bed to keep her extra warm . 
most things that are popular just flat out suck . 
get rid of some of the weak points that draw attention and lead to destruction . 
i purchased the pink variety of the smart shade blush . 
the texas heat and chocolate do not mix ,  even in the spring time . 
i tried with with my macbook pro with both mountain lion and mavericks . 
i don t know whether this bottle is contaminated or whether something is going on with it . 
i would just make sure you get an actual new bowl . 
i give this item one star because of two reasons . 
it has a handle ,  locks securely ,  yet easy to remove . 
this is a tame boring watch ,  functional ,  just not as much fun as the excessively large ones . 
the connector tore while trying to install this . 
you might want to move the chair closer to the bathroom . 
instead ,  it s a cheap funhouse mirror type of mirror .  .  . who wants to look at that ?  ?  . 
it s easy to pump and makes quick work of my bike tires . 
i received this scale and weighed myself after going through the lengthy setup process . 
the knife comes dull out of the box ,  and its chopping performance leaves much to be desired . 
i have also found that the left and right buttons malfunction or stop working sporadically for no apparent reason . 
even though skinceuticals is pricier ,  i prefer it to the good  n natural . 
the head and tail were chewed to bits in probably less than num_num minutes . 
one was huge ,  the other much too small . 
there are two things that would improve these gloves . 
this product actually clogs up the small area where you insert the fabric softener . 
i really wanted my cat to like this because of the healthy ingredients and good reviews . 
i love walden farms dressings and pancake syrup . 
i did not like the taste of this; tasted more like the stuff you feed the birds . 
every vista stuns ,  every cloud ,  bush ,  bit of fog ,  wisp of hair is painstakingly rendered in sparkling perfection . 
other than that ,  the product is pretty good because it s not as oily and salty as fritos . 
they are extremely thin vinyl with hardly any flannel backing . 
since getting the deal with the nfl ea sports has cut corners and produced shotty work . 
they either stop working because if you wind the unit up to the end it can break the unit . 
darn !  i m so disappointed because i really had hopes this would smell like the patchouli of days gone by . 
this is the first brand of honeybush tea i ve tried . 
it s made to leak ,  no matter how much connector is tightened . 
th graphics and sound are stupendous ,  however it is basically impossible to make money . 
these shoes are good however the size was incorrect and my sister could not wear it at all . 
and ,  it shreds ! i had read the poor reviews ,  and always try to keep an open mind . 
definitely don t recommend this for folks with gas stoves  and why doesn t the manf . 
my cat would not eat this even when crushed and mixed with food . 
i have upper thoracic and lower lumbar back problems . 
i would recommend a different cereal like oreo o s or count chocula . 
it s been awhile since i bought this but after i saw that i can still give a review . 
perhaps it is just my head ,  but this did not fit me well and i stopped using it immediately . 
i ll never again buy any product from medline . 
not sure what it was but had that not been a problem i might have kept them . 
i read all the reviews and decided to give this product a try so i bought num_extend
if you want music played in your car from your phone ,  do it the right way . 
it does give a nice glow but by the end of the day it can look greasy . 
their enemies soon destroy the planet ,  but the ship has enough energy to return the scientists to earth . 
i gave them to my sister ,  and she ended up throwing them away . 
it is disgusting that they call this simply the  turkey  recipe and not  turkey + assorted fish  . 
 just a few drops .   huh ?  not to be overly anal but do you mean short drops or long drops . 
this is the first one i ve found that doesn t work ! avoid these . 
i m a big fan of bayer colon care . 
but the whole design of the top leaves much to be desired . 
additionally ,  i really can t make out the flavors . 
now for the trial of this scullcap herb . 
it cannot be screwed on securely like the original part . 
compared to my smc wireless pc card this usb device is useless . 
we have bought the vip pets in the past for our daughter . 
it does not whirl around ,  including from top to bottom ,  like my cheapo old oster . 
i prefer fiber one bars ,  nutrigrain bars ,  and even planter s peanut bars over this . 
next time i ll purchase in a store where i can actually feel the press before buying . 
i attempted to replace the large ear insert ,  and could not buy them with the covers . 
elder scrolls ,  titan quest ,  etc .   but the game design is inferior in many respects to its competitors . 
then a friend told me that they just use regular tennis balls so i tried it . 
this game is in every way less than san andreas . 
i will not purchase another seidio active case for my next phone . 
it sounded great on internal speaker or on fm radio . 
and the better quality denim means they ll last longer anyway . 
i absolutely loved the color and feel of this cover . 
i bought this for my samsung num_extend expecting somewhat of a snug fit  i don t have a case  . 
i checked the ingredient list which has menthol in it . 
i am not very happy with this product and there is no way to contact seller with any issues . 
i don t know to blame my dissatisfaction on them or the argan oil . 
i was expecting a rise of nations game but with fantasy factions . 
especially when in battle and it swivels on you while you re taking on an enemy . 
instead ,  tastes just like any one of the other in the line . 
the third one lasted thru dove season  maybe num_num bricks of cci stingers  and the zoom control went . 
unfortunately they sent it back and tried a second time . 
fortunately it doesnt taste burnt ,  but it doesnt taste that great either . 
hmm ordered it a week ago and they  amazon  still haven t shipped it . 
it allows the radio to latch on to some frequencies that otherwise would be intolerable ,  due to interference . 
it is made very cheap ,  hence the cheap price ,  but it simply never worked for us . 
into waiting and saw that it was getting pretty light so i decided to wait an additional num_num min . 
i was very disappointed with this krusteaz banana nut muffin mix . 
i recently became a fan of kershaw and you can get soooo much more for your money . 
i have a one year old cat  neutered male  who is extremely energetic and playful . 
the pasta roller is the first piece of equipment that i ve had any trouble with . 
i was so convinced that it would take care of my back issues . 
hope this thing lasts the week ,  otherwise i have some sewing to do . 
i haven t used it yet but the state of it kind of took the wind out of my sails . 
it is only good if you never need to take it off ever again . 
i found the trek bicycle pure trike  msrp $ and was pleased . 
lots of trial and error with cat toys ,  i guess !  . 
if it s a windy day ,  it s just not strong enough . 
when i searched for a samsung galaxy num_extend charger this product popped up . 
could be completed in one sitting ,  clocking in at just over five hours . 
real question for skechers overseas made quality . love these . 
the stuff that the medics put on is always num_num or num_num inches wide . 
do your research and buy something like netgear or dlink . 
this is not the sellers fault but i cannot say how these work because they are useless to my . 
if you hold it a little too tight on the wrong part it will pop open . 
i have a queen size air bed and it works great . 
to say i m annoyed would be the understatement of the century . 
it worked for barely num_num months ,  if that . 
it s particularly hard to do on small cans . 
but there are so few characters to choose from that its really laughable . 
i have had this grinder for over seven years without a problem and paid about half what this cost . 
they work ,  but i highly doubt they ll still be around in num_num years . 
maybe i ll keep it just because he can dunk the dolphins and toss them around . 
i am sorry to say that this was a waste of my good money . 
i thought maybe from reading the reviews that these things would be somewhat useable . 
i ve reproduced this bug ,  and a normal nic card gives me no problems . 
all i heard about was how good the game was and gettin it started everything was so repetitive . 
it s too expensive ,  too labor intensive ,  and will not be refilled . 
bottom line ,  the coffee is great ,  but this is too irritating . 
i have a small westie that uses piddle pads at night . 
i returned it for a refund and bought the hoover empower from amazon . 
maybe it s just us ,  but we don t prefer this flavor . 
the cats hated to use it and constantly whined for their original  bowl of water  back . 
they are usually very durable ,  especially considering my dogs can chew anything to shreds . 
i just am not willing to go thru all of that . 
bought two to replace my tubes as i have a lot of thorns on my path to work . 
in our case ,  they warped in the dishwasher and rendered the entire machine unusable . 
if you put something metal  or even touch the grid  it shorts and turns itself off . 
hopefully the new designs of the last num_num months will be better . 
and then it finally just failed completely ,  and i haven t had it much longer than a year . 
having two num_extend mags on your belt is challenging enough without worrying about them falling off . 
as described in the manual ,  the little green light lit up . 
no ,  i would not intentionally buy this again . 
but our ever expanding inventory is no match for these adorably over priced chests . 
threw them out  !  there is no miracle here . 
this case is inexpensive because it s cheaply made . 
he tore it apart ,  and tried to eat the cloth . 
i purchased this cable after my old htc data cable started going on the fritz . 
boosting the antenna power will not make the signals travel through walls ,  or around corners any better . 
i really would like to have them all ,  even for a higher price . 
 even though this game is rated e for everyone ,  be warned :  this game is not very easy ,  or fun . 
usually ,  i can fix most of the software issues . 
if they want to reach out to mass gamers ,  that is just what they need to do . 
i just happen to be a baby who tries to read ingredients . 
it looks and feels like something from the easy bake oven line . 
i like micro usb and the majority of hand held electronic devices use micro usb now . 
a call to linksys got it working ,  and it died after num_num minutes of surfing . 
she paid $ more than the amazon . com price . 
like that person ,  i never buy anything made outside of the us for my dogs . 
this does slide down your fridge .  .  .  .  . even with little weight ,  if you dont balance the weight on the two ends . 
i didn t know it was made in china until receiving the bags . 
in addition ,  the filter s outer glass just spun freely . 
i ve used other car adapters without any problem . 
this came not very inflated to begin with . 
i have been on candex a year now . 
i purchased the jambox as a black friday special . 
my pictures are clearer without it and it doesn t even make a good doorstop . 
pour it on any type of fish ,  or chicken dish . 
a disc lock and num_extend of heavy duty hardened chain from the hardware store run about $
most of what your coach says to you is hardly better than mindless dribble . 
i don t know what to do with the remainderof the open one . 
i was so excited to buy this for my three year old daughter . 
i suppose this is proof that shavers cannot  lift  hairs to cut better . 
wouldn t recommend if you really need help use and online doctor or see your physician . 
this toy billed to keep dogs entertained for hours lasted my dog num_num min . be very careful with this toy . 
a little deceiving but i don t blame amazon . 
fabric is soft and comfortable and my dog seems to not know he is wearing one . 
however ,  this is only praise that i can bestow upon this product . 
the fabric is way too pliable and has no structure and stretches out too easily . 
num_num seconds on average probably . is it fun ?  not really . 
num_extend is a very cool game and num_extend looks even better . 
this is especially true on my iphone since the screen is much smaller . 
i have a white haze in my tank and was hoping this would get rid of it . 
a cat s liver is not capable of processing it . 
i have been trying to get him to play with it ,  but it isn t fun . 
everything will turns out wonky unless you are willing to spend ages working on it . 
the fit is also very tight and was not comfortable after about num_num minutes . 
a different story line ,  something closer to the original and less goofy . 
i m currently using the third film until i can get something else in . 
the produce did not work right out of the box . 
first of all ,  it takes sonic forever to speed up . 
although it didn t stain my countertop ,  it did stain a white cotton dishtowel a pink tone . 
not only is it repetitive and quite boring ,  you can very rarely travel back to places you came from . 
i added sour cream ,  which helped but i still couldn t eat it . 
we took it back again and he chose an electro beyblade which he is very happy with . 
i suggest another kind of skechers for people on their feet throughout the day . 
i also like how the calphalon has glass lids instead of metal . 
i was surprised to realize the screw was very loose ,  not even tighten all the way in . 
is this the same acme corporation that sells items to wile e . 
see if you can find a better quality version of the game . 
even before the mold developed it just wasn t as interesting as the butterfly kit . 
they digest it well and they are healthy . 
you ll probably get through it long before the rental period is up ,  and only have spent a few dollars . 
i actually love pirate s booty snacks so i was over eager and purchased num_num huge cases of these . 
they were good while they lasted ,  which wasn t very long . 
we ll see . the spout pulls out of the top and water flows into the cup . 
the sad part of their whole strategy is they want to charge more for their questionable practices . 
i got this on the basis of it being a final fantasy game . 
braun merged the replacement for the num_num series  activator  with the num_num complete . 
i continue to enjoy the pop up peg toy ,  now it s fixed . 
it didn t last but about two weeks and it broke at the bottom . 
i wasted time carefully running the cable along the wall ,  concealing it a bit so as to be tidy . 
my hair looked aweful !  the first few uses were okay . 
i soon discovered it wasnt the wireless feature that was the problem . 
six months ago i bought num_num cans and returned all num_num to the store . 
that might be true ,  but it s not the way we use computers . thanks for your time . 
these chews i have bought before and had a problem with size not being as described . 
this shoe fell apart way sooner than it should have . 
ok ,  i bought them because they were cheap but ,  ,  c mon ,  they re super cheaply made too . 
yea ! by the way ,  the description here says this is a  minimizing  bra . 
willmanbought for wife ,  waaaaaay to small so she gave it to one of her friends . 
i have to give away the stockpile i had . 
well ,  i whipped out my new large pan and it would not set flat on my stove top . 
as it is ,  the console control setup is terrible . 
two of the rollers didn t even touch my back  i am num_extend num_num lbs  . 
the courts look great and the player models are fantastic . 
it just won t fly !  i tried even changing brand new duracel batteries in the controller . 
something is wrong with the packaging process ,  or the cooking process ,  but these rot fast unopened . 
it can trap dirt even it is retracted . 
ordered my usual size num_num and could not get them zippered . 
i ended up having to make a hole for the earphone plug in . 
i don t use sugar in my coffee but this definitely needed it . 
very unfortunate and i should have know better and went to a store and bought this . 
in fact ,  it is the only button that seems to be reasonably well located . 
even the fit was off but of course the worst part was the fabric . 
i think the face masks ,  the floor globe and the hawaiian clothes are nice . 
the bladder separated from the exterior so it was almost impossible to get the ball inflated . 
the other flavor i bought better not taste as bad . 
my family tried them and my husband really disliked them and the kids weren t impressed . 
too bad it s a knockoff and not the real thing . 
unfortunately though ,  i find that these are not really strong enough to hold my pants into place . 
i would not recommend this product to anyone . 
it doesn t look very natural in my opinion . 
everyone asked where i got it and i happily referred them to solvit . 
the package says buffalo and venison ,  yet on the ingredients buffalo is number one ,  then chicken ,  then lamb . 
now lint is catching all along the edges ,  and that s worse than the glare and fingerprints . 
i m glad i only bought this as a practice because it s the ugliest bra i ve ever owned . 
a major reason this game was so enjoyable was that you could do anything you want . 
i think they got it confused with the rotten ,  moldy tobacco . 
typical of the us food industry ,  they have to pack the product full of salt . 
i just didn t care for it or the way it looked or felt either . 
barring impending starvation ,  i can not bring myself to open it . 
i eat whole grain pasta all the time and love it . 
but ,  the first one that i ordered arrived broken  wouldn t get cold at all . 
i bought this bike because it was handy and portable and didn t take up much space . 
the ingredients are not fully listed on amazon . 
the designers definitely need to go back to the drawing board on this . 
one was a small cat and i made an additional hole in the collar to fit . 
with any video game you need to have responsive controls . 
top right button is a spare right click . 
so for $ or $ i still wouldn t buy it and definitely definitely not for $
if you are not dark complected ,  i would seriously not recommend this . 
i had to cut out the elastic band and then adjust the wait to the size i wanted . 
ridiculous checkpoints ,  no in game saves ,  this game is a horror to play . 
after several different tries ,  we finally settled onessential medical supply everyday essentials deluxe hard plastic sock aid . 
guess what palm wants you to do then ? my num_extend as a longtime palm user . 
i have to say the graphics are great . 
this thing is too mall to even be a charm on a bracelet . 
i rate it at one star   i hate it  on the official amazon scale  . 
i did notice his arthritis was improving but i didn t like having to clean up the poop . 
i only hand wash it; i do not use the dishwasher for cleaning it . 
here ,  there is no one outside at all . 
it s not like i collect duffles as i had none . 
i used this toothbrush one time and had to throw it away . 
not sure if it was defective when i bought it or whether the product has issues in itself . 
gave them to my daughter and she had no luck either . 
looks more like something you d spend $ on for a child . 
he loves it ,  but within the first day two of the loops are torn apart ,  leaving the filling exposed . 
the bra kept sliding down all day and did not provide any lift . 
i have had no flare problem with the optics . 
i usually like logitech products ,  which is why i m amazed they would actually put their name on this garbage . 
in fact i regret the weeks i have used it in place of my normal products . 
i have used similar products since and this hasn t been an issue and they haven t broken . 
i fixed this pasta last night and no one liked it . 
one of my ferrets chewed on the liner and became trapped in between the liner and the outer shell . 
i was even exfoliating with a good product while using the soap . 
we had the phone for about num_num months before i threw it away . 
there is plenty of room to put everything . 
again ,  i paid shipping and cuisinart replaced the machine . 
returned the item because the slots were covered for charging . 
having large buttons was good ,  and a voice reads the numbers as you punch them in . 
electronics obviously burnt out right away . believe it s directly from china . 
won t stay up on my chair and keeps flopping down . 
first num_num ingredients :  water ,  petroleum , glycerin and mineral oil . 
i will not buy another in this series ,  and i urge noone else to either . 
the graphic looks good compared to other wii games . 
i think i would have had a much easier time if i did it that way . 
it also has a large head  as advertised  . 
however ,  i found this game to be frustrating to the extreme . 
a friend of mine has used it and not noticed these issues ,  so perhaps it s just me . 
if this is the same cartrige ,  and it looks identical ,  this is the buggiest game i ve ever seen . 
normally the standard num_num are my jean of choice ,  but i decided to try the black stretch . 
stubbs had potential ,  but it s just too faulty . 
i just replaced two graters myself because they broke . 
if you had thicker thighs would be good . 
it s used in supplements and store bought msm pills or powders ,  making it worthless . 
then it can only do num_num devices ,  then only one device . 
that vibrating thing feels bizarre to shave with . 
so i sent them back and will try a different shoe . 
it s always slipping off the top or bottom . 
one made it ,  the other one was shattered inside . i don t know how the one survived the trip . 
now i have a cheap tacky phone case missing rhinestones that i would never put on my phone . 
you ll save a lot ,  and it won t be as dusty . 
i love the peanut butter chocolate ,  and the plain peanut butter is also good . 
i have used and liked other blum natural cleansing wipes . 
these are made far too loose and flexible for most professional mics . 
i m told that this isn t bad ,  but it s not strong enough . 
got a full refund since the purchase went through amazon . the phone itself is very sleek . 
they had a well deserved reputation for rugged clothes . 
i shoudl ve listened to the other reviews that said about this problem . 
some of these folks selling the fakes are still charging $ for the classic tall . 
unfortunately numi does not go into any detail about the history and grade of the pu erh they use . 
a truck rolled up around num_num and my standard was the num_num lorna doone sleeve and the large coffee . 
it seems they prefer the rachael ray or alpo i was feeding them before . 
finally boxed the unit and sent back to netgear . 
over the course of the day ,  my skin would become uncomfortably oily . 
it does work on windows num_num pro num_num bit . 
this product is good ,  but tastes rather bland . 
well it works ,  but the scoop isn t magnetic it s hung by a cheap plastic clip . 
i checked the bulb and switches and everything . 
buy it on amazon but i got no response by the warranty . 
anybody want to buy mine on the cheap ?  it s basically worthless aside from being great at thawing foods . 
the idea is cute ,  i just don t think it translated very well to the actual toy . 
not sure way this was as date said it was good till num_num  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  . 
i should also mention that the bottom tends to slide off too easy ,  so it s always coming off . 
after my first leg ,  i pulled over to notice the rack sagged significantly . 
and i could not get public tv at all on one of my tvs . 
increasing the screen resolution in video options surprisingly didn t improve the visual presentation of the game one bit . 
thank you amazon for such great customer service . 
otherwise they run a bit small in width compared to similar boots . 
we got the stegosaurus toy and so far ,  it s held up . 
the last one was a disaster with multiple bubbles . 
i definitely prefer to buy cardboard over plastic . 
but .  .  . i didn t sense much in the way of ginger . 
i mistakenly read a review here stating that it fit mophie products . 
this is the first amazon item i give one star to . 
this is the worse case i ve ever bought . 
would have given zero stars if available . spend a few dollars more and buy a digital probe style . 
the ppi is embarrassingly ugly at this point . 
but does not work well for watery type liquid . 
they are very comfortable in feel and fit . 
towards the end of the first third of the game ,  it became insanely difficult . 
so our james is defective .  .  . hoping that we can exchange it . 
my mom bought this masque for me when i told her i needed more . 
instead ,  use num_extend and configure as a repeater . regards , rafael arvelorafaelarvelo@gmail . com . 
for a first aid kit you can do much better elsewhere . 
unfortunately i was very wrong ! i tried it in my tea and i could still taste that bitter aftertaste . 
i started using this product a few years ago because i was allergic to all the other litters . 
the stitching comes apart from the human using the slingshot aspect . 
you are better off with sticks and grass . 
they re metal clips will retain the belt lock . 
the seeds i bought were from sprout house . 
first the pictured item is a tan or sunburst color but the one i received was pink . 
players are asked questions that are such a mindless mixture of popular culture and weird facts . 
if you hate the traditional peppermill ,  then this might be for you . 
ordered this and it did not work ,  ordered the soft strap one after and it didn t work either . 
i m not really sure what this one was trying to emulate . 
but ,  nothing happened  spent $ on it too  . 
it does not grasp the can properly thus creating and even cutting surface on the can . 
fortunately ,  the nuts are either halved peanuts ,  whole almonds ,  or cashew pieces . 
i was hoping it would match the weight at the weight watcher center where i attend classes . 
i bought fungal defense years ago for my husband whose big toenails were seriously incurring a fungal infection . 
otherwise there is no point in buying it from amazon . 
i dont even know why i tried it . its silky but it leaves a noticeable shine on your face . 
then we ll move on to the course designs . 
if you don t mind finding glitter all over your stuff ,  this is the case for you . 
i looked for a long time for the right one and this is not it . 
the battery light indicator may or may not work . 
just use a rubber band and plastic bag and call it good . 
this isn t a bad tasting wild rice blend but it is certainly nothing special . 
it will also throw chunks of stuff into the collector bin that should have been juiced . 
its extremely tight !  so my suggestion try them on before buying these jeans !  !  !  . 
of course the rice container needs replacing already . 
i d ask my parents to never ever buy them for that reason . 
it takes days for it to arrive anyway . 
this nasty nasty coffee should be served at state and federal prisons . 
both of these are reminiscent of metal gear solid . 
particular files need to be installed in a particular order . 
we have so many of the food sets that i can t even count them anymore . 
decent quality but they are the low end of the champion line . 
once i cut them ,  i realized that it lost all structure to the case . 
what i love about my tarte concealer is that its so light and blends in with your skin . 
didn t add any length or volume ,  just weighed my lashes down . 
he said  why did you buy old lady smelling lotion ?   . 
my son loves bruder trucks so we got him a couple bruder men also . 
i see there are many ,  many others with this problem . 
i based my choice on the design of the locking mechanism . 
with the godiva name ,  i was definitely expecting high quality chocolate in this basket . 
if you can t join a group  called linkshells  ,  you will be spending minutes or hours waiting to join parties . 
finally the label says no refined sugar ,  but concentrating fruit juices is refining sugar ,  just a matter of technicality . 
they look really good ,  but they are never comfortable . 
i think i will just throw it out and go buy a remington instead . 
i also just realized i never received the muffin tin .  .  . i only received the other num_num pieces . 
although it ll probably work better with older kids who can control their strength . 
my left ankle felt incredibly tight ,  and i felt my mobility was restricted . 
i owned a braun miniprimer plus hand blender ,  with variable speeds and broad stainless steel housing for the blades . 
also ,  i did get a little in my eye while trying to remove it and that was also unpleasant . 
i have a pyrex pie pan that is num_num years old and still going strong . 
size up if you get a good deal on this . 
it was very frustrating to use and i am returning this product . 
additionally the fabric sewn to the leather that goes between your toes is completely work out on one sandal . 
i still can t imagine that people actually gave it the glowing reviews i ve read . 
don t waste time buying tony hawk num_extend its not worth it . 
i end up carrying my regular travel iron now . 
all three of my kids have loved legos and the little lego action figures . 
so it just sits on my counter and looks pretty . 
it vibrates faster than any of the adjustable ones . 
the blade connection in the bottom of the container is plastic and it strips out of the motor constantly . 
we spend quite a bit of time at the beach and involve ourselves in some watersports  kayaking  . 
wait a couple of months till they release the real game . 
we thought it would be better for him to have his own . 
i don t recommend to anyone to buy this product . 
i found that it was hard to put on and fairly dry . 
where other companies would send out a replacement ,  no questions asked ,  this company does not . 
my arch hurt so bad ,  felt like a big lump sticking into my foot . 
i bought this for my golden retriever who s an aggressive chewer . 
i would agree with another reviewer that it s like chewing on a piece of rubber . 
this tarp tore on the very first use ,  it s of poor quality . 
makes me worry about other people being able to get in as administrator . all in all a nice unit . 
it has very little arch support and the cushioning is all that great either . 
the quality is very poor; extremely in some cases : a . 
now this one has fallen to the  sony kiss of death .   it keeps turning off and will not restart . 
on your final order review ,  be sure to check amazon s seller carefully . 
this cream did not work well for me ,  probably because it contains methylparaben and propylparaben . 
i bought the num_num that comes with the headset . 
cannot use the soap as it is in pieces . 
it was securely packed and everything was in great order . 
many of my friends recommended this for me . 
this case if very cute and protective ,  but it s no where near the quality of the otterbox . 
you can create a custom named shelf and place books on it . 
its starting to really bother me therefore ,  i purchased this pore cleanser . 
the finger brush is so soft as to be useless . 
not good for winter use ,  we had to turn the heat up ,  which defeats the purpose . 
i m looking for a new type of remote set if there are any out there . 
i bought this in feb num_num for $ and it broke after num_num months . 
i didn t mind having to put batteries in the toy . 
my two stars are for color and design which are fine and precise . 
and the zon would not do a refund or return . 
all the hype turn out to be true . 
num_num days later there was still some ice . 
if you use anything other than lithium  very expensive  or alkaline  poor performance  the positive contact will not touch . 
this is the saddest excuse for a game i have ever seen . 
now the case sits in my desk drawer . 
now foods magnesium capsules num_extend mgs  ,  solgar magnesium citrate ,  and nature made high potency magnesium are not chelated . 
don t use in full sun or on cuttings or plants stressed by drought . 
i ordered these from wag . com not checking reviews first . 
he did not enjoy it very much at all until he was able to sit up . 
i really wish i remembered what the brand name was for the one that was red . 
it should stay free until they can resolve the cheating exploits once and for all . 
others have told me it worked for their birds . 
but the minuses definitely outweigh the pluses ,  that s for sure . 
it was hard to put on and the rubber kept moving around . 
forget about automatics ,  they are in the past ,  only crazy collectors buy them . 
this is not what it says it is . 
and it lasted exactly num_num seconds before the belt stop working . this is a defective game . 
actually bought all of those in larger bottles . 
used this product for several weeks ,  as directed and it did not make one bit of difference . 
also ,  i would note a very inconsistent flavor . 
if i didn t have safety outlets ,  i could have received an electric shock when using the product . 
i worked with my card for over num_num weeks and several phone calls to the useless customer support group . 
this game is such a waste of time . 
not a long while like neverwinter nights ,  but a little while . 
another complaint is that the box states use twice daily ,  but this product did not even last a week . 
i am grateful for this . bought this without looking to make sure it was gmo free . 
great for running engines ,  not so great for a human body . 
four of those losses were due to this and i lost them on the last drive of the game . 
the fabric straps were a little flimsy but workable . the black foam rubber though was a deal breaker . 
i couldn t keep one of my puppies from shredding the pads . 
although the picture is very nice looking ,  save you money ,  look at something else !   :   . 
they are concealing it and implying studies were done based on their specific product which is not the case . 
you learn to slowly apply the accelerator and how exactly to drive to maximize fuel economy . 
i am now struggling to get rid of the darker patches . 
i roasted it but it still tastes weird ,  in a bad way . 
gives me a nice place to hang my keys while i m not using them at work . 
the  oil slick effect  on the screen protector was an absolute disaster . 
it does come in a an easy to use resealable bag . 
i can t read the directions without finding reading glasses . 
my last wallet was an agner that lasted num_num years . 
all the beyblade stuff i bought was requested by a num_num year old boy . 
this is why i am giving this only one star ,  in spite of the spectacularness of the game . 
it took me an hour to beat the game % and the graphics were awful . 
the beginning takes a lot from tomb raider and is quite pointless . 
does moisturize and smells decent but does not moisturize as well as i thought it would . 
i ended up feeding mine to the squirrels . 
each cube is attached to at least three other cubes by the plastic cut that surrounds each cube . 
then  if you re lucky  ,  once the app connects to the headset ,  you can change the settings . 
i just broke my second pair of these in less than num_num months . 
no positive lock onto the iphone with the grip connector . 
does that indicate i have two pair coming ?  ?  i only want one pair . 
i will state again ,  do not buy these for hitting the heavy bag . 
i have to agree with the reviewers who said this product was not a strong hold spray . 
had i realized that the contents were this mushy ,  i never would have bought a case of it . 
i purchase both the  smooth  heat protector and this tresemme  tamer protector . 
no change when put on in advance of a storm or during a storm . 
i swapped it at staples ,  and tried again . 
it s not slick no matter how much water i mix or cream i use . 
i have used two of these and i think i need to get the higher quality ones . 
but then ,  they wouldn t have been able to sell me this crap . 
though if ea would remake this series i would buy that . 
the sensors are super sensitive ,  and will go off if you just brush up against the toy . 
the magnet in the stick needs to be stronger . 
i only got one packet ,  so i can t speak on how much it helped my energy level . 
difficult to get the eyelid folds correct with the tool given  it kept sticking to the glue  . 
which i think is false advertisement . otherwise it s a good product if you are not looking for fully submersible heater . 
the first pair had one speaker that had no bass . 
it had a generous fit until i washed it . 
too expensive foronly one effect at a time . 
it can t chop any firmer fruits or vegetables . it also cannot stand . 
a little too much pressure and the whole thing falls apart . 
you will get more veggies and your taste buds will thank you . 
the plastic is cheap and does not go on well . 
i was expecting the typical final fantasy ,  epic storyline ,  chocobos ,  and parties . 
the one it comes with works well for the chalkboard . 
everything else is ticking me off lately ,  this vaio being the latest . 
this pins do not hold your hair up . 
i read the reviews and ordered an num_extend should have went with a num_num num_extend
this product is way too short ,  even for toddlers . 
the images download slooooooow via a serial port . 
the inner bag looked like it had been sealed at one time and cleanly cut open . 
i could not get it squeezed in there so the internal measurements are definitely smaller . 
i did not expect it to be oem ,  and it is definitely not an apple quality product . 
i don t know what it is but this seems like it actually makes you thirsty . 
whether you pay num_extend or get it for free ,  it does not work !  !  . 
just checked consumer reports and hope to pick up one of the one s recommended by them . 
you will get better quality by the same name somewhere else . 
you can either use special moves ,  attack or use an item . 
in the title this one states size :  num_extend
for the record this was my second example i took the first one back . 
on the second day ,  the pause button stopped working and i couldn t change tracks anymore . 
i m not a good player ,  honestly ,  but i never once died during the game . 
this is the worst product i have ever purchased in my life . 
i use this stuff daily and keep buying it ,  but i just can t get past the awful taste . 
even then ,  you can only see it in full sunlight . 
it bends and the doors are already falling off the hinges . 
i have waxed before and it doesn t hurt nearly as much as this thing . 
only thing keeping it from num_num star is it was only $ when i purchased . 
sites like howard forums  google it  are good for finding out what others have experienced . 
i think both are more flattering and comfortable . 
i didn t know what to do with this spray . 
i am disappointed and would like a full refund . 
i really like those games and was hoping this was similar . this game does allow you to race .  .  .  .  . that is true . 
i finally returned the router and purchased a different company s wireless router . 
i put only one clove in at a time . 
the only thing this thermometer does  at least easily  is set for beef ,  pork or poultry . 
i was disappointed that this case doesn t have a clip on it . 
when it finally started to blend it was chunky and very sticky . 
datel s products are much better in my opinion . 
maybe that game will have some redeeming qualities ?  don t hold your breath ,  kids . 
pure stevia is the only sweetener that does not alter the glycemic index . 
my dogs ,  who are squeak toy experts ,  killed these things in about num_num minutes after getting them . 
ea ,  take a look at stardock ,  or at the very least ,  valve . 
if you have silver hair this will make it appear a dark drab gray . 
it was a piece of crap that wasn t even worth the num_num dollars i spent on it . 
after measuring and measuring ,  i thought this was the best option for our crate . 
i bought these in xl and they were too small . 
how much damage does a magic missile in ddo cause ?  dunno . 
i put both of the num_extend side by side and there is no comparison . 
i think it would protect the underlying finish but you just may not like the way it looks . 
it made me develop white splotches on my body ,  which make me look like i have vitiligo . 
the port covered by the little bit of rubber doesn t have that piece at all . 
i decided to try this food as part of the vine program for my schnauzer . 
its possible that if your skin is either dry or combination this foundation will work . 
they are smaller and they have defects ,  such as being cut irregularly . 
i have to go through the whole process of clicking on the systray icon ,  etc . 
you have to press down really hard to get the areas you want to work . 
however ,  it is stylish ,  and the face has high contrast and is legible . 
i have oily skin though i m in my num_extend and this exacerbated my break outs . 
these shirts were a great disappointment for me . 
more importantly ,  they roll at most one firmware update for any given rev of the hardware . 
i was expecting alittle more action death coolness ,  but it wasn t there . 
use a kneeling pad instead ! the kneeling pad has worked beautifully !  no more skinning my knees . 
i have the latest version and there are many problems . 
which hasn t been updated since november num_extend gates . 
you could eat an entire bag and barely notice . 
i bought a sima universal remote ,  it wound up on ebay one day later . 
all you will see is yourself starring back at you in this situation . 
it tastes rancid ,  like flour or rice that s gotten too old . 
i m so bummed out because i really wanted to like it . 
oh and i cant forget the server crashes although less frequent now they still occur . 
but everyone of these failed in a miserably short amount of time . 
the girl did a great job applying it ,  i just wasn t crazy about how it looked on my face . 
i was surprised this was so light weight . 
these are not the same strength as lactaid . 
i bought these and have eaten them topped with a teriyaki sauce or a chicken cream sauce . 
you get what you pay for so for the price ,  it may be worth it to some . 
i d take it apart and clean it and there would be poop streaks across the entire inside . 
just like the movie upon which its based ,  this could ve been something great . 
i didn t even bother cleaning it this time; it s in the trash . 
although my dogs loved these they are very easy to choke on . 
i never really felt any benefits from taking this supplement . 
the levels are all intact ,  with the original animations and music . 
i bought one of these almost a year ago . 
it was at the very bottom of the container . 
i know how they make me feel  wired ,  edgy  . 
unfortunately ,  the controls and gameplay kill this promising concept . 
it seems more like pen ink than pencil ink !  it s not smooth writing ,  either . 
hard plastic under the heel with hardly any cushion and no cushion at all in the forefoot area . 
turn on the lantern and a little fan disperses the scent . 
the lubricant that is used for the rotating mechanism ended up on the glass and now it is unusable . 
one of very few bad purchases on amazon . 
this is my personal opinion ,  but i do not like this gel . 
at that point i gave up and tossed it . 
my dog is a big puller ,  very stubborn and occasionally exhibits aggression towards other dogs on the leash . 
nautica voyage is a realistic option for somebody who wants to spend under twenty dollars on cologne . 
came very sharp nice grain handle ,  however the sheath is a bit chintzy and was damaged in shipment . 
if i thouhgt i could return it for a full refund i would . 
i now have done so much research that i think eating health ,  live ,  natural whole foods is enough . 
the attachments constantly fall off ,  and the whole things looks like it s been through a war . 
the pieces are rather small ,  so there is no dental benefit either . 
the skin tones come out all wrong and it is obvious to almost everybody . 
yes ,  i m sure they are quite  organic  and such . 
the display on the machine is legible and quite straightforward . 
this exact treadmill with more workout options and a quality pair of speakers would serve an untapped market . 
yep ,  num_extend time i used the umbrella it will no longer stay open . 
she s num_extend but she must have never drunk coffee before . 
turns out this soap is gentle on dirt ,  too . 
i ended up spending num_num or num_num days working on this and atleast num_num hours time . 
but full price plus shipping is a total rip off guys !  !  ! with that said ,  i really give flynn num_num stars . 
i was very under impressed with this hair dryer . 
i bought this for my at the time num_num year old daughter . 
it will let you reap the benefits of normal blood pressure after about a week . 
the kvm just sits there with the num_extend computer light blinking rapidly and pressing the buttons does not work . 
except that roles are just character classes ,  and paradigms are just the roles your party is currently using . 
puppy had no interest in it what at all . 
it has a steel inner shell ,  which itself is highly heat conducive . 
he didn t appreciate me putting it on his foot . 
i thought i would give it a try . 
surely i thought  jasmine vanilla  would be a delicious fragrance . 
for about $ more than this costs ,  i could buy a  real  digital camera with num_num mp . 
mine stopped working after having it just a little over a month . 
i like my new phone too much to see it fly out of my hand on onto the ground . 
i was most excited for this cover and it was so disappointing . 
this is the most flavorless granola i have ever tasted . 
i bought this for a sony num_extend camera . 
maybe his body chemistry just didn t go with it . 
they would be fine on a kids bike . 
i don t want to waste too much time on this crappy game . 
i am returning this and getting the  soft outdoor bed  of the same brand instead . 
after using it two weeks i m now in the market for an electric air popper . 
item arrived fine ,  worked great out of the box . 
i also have a problem getting all the douche solution to come out . 
i grew up using peppermint oil and this is not pure what so ever . 
this tubing is way to small to attach other things to . 
they often get snagged or pulled out of alignment . 
this has been returned since the dimensions listed are not the dimensions of the dish . 
my son loved playing with it until the foot fell off and then the wings stopped retracting . 
i could hear it in the next room . 
love the quality of this top but it ran too small so i had to return it . 
you still can t change individual defensive players assignments . 
i will consider resident evil num_num depending on many aspects . 
not sure what i will do with them now . 
a visit to the disney interactive site for tech support . 
it tastes just about like someone tried to make a bean sprout smoothie  and has the same texture  . 
and i can not verify how long it lasted . 
we may try out a different variation of the puzzle because it does seem like fun . 
i bought the playboy daily mostiturizer instead ,  much better . 
it makes a grinding sound that ,  at least ,  drowns out the motor of my desktop fountain . 
i ordered this because it was supposed to be very healthful . 
i ve not seen any change in my arthritic hands ,  knees ,  ankles etc . 
i ll also mention that it came to me leaking in the box ,  not good packaging . 
i m num_num and i have very fair ,  sensitive skin . 
and i agree that these are really difficult to walk in . 
they could have did waaay better with this game . 
i had to go over my line a few times to get a super rich color . 
also the sublingual tablets take forever to dissolve . 
these bb s are very small not the nrmal size . 
the battle system s biggest flaw :  you can t choose which enemy to attack . 
if it gets pressed while turned on its side it will leak . 
i am very satisfied and nobody could tell it was bought online . 
one of the bad games sega had made . 
its harder than gold ,  silver ,  aluminum or steel . 
not at all easy to install or use . 
you ll be quickly tired of reading internet lingo spewed in the chat box every other second . 
this has absolutely no effect on the little critters . 
num_num for myself and num_num for my son . 
i ve tried the other flavors of wellness core out on my cats and they love them . 
it has a decent scent throw ,  but only at first . 
he said some of his patients found relief from dr . 
the mail pieces always wind up lost in the sea of toys and parts in the house . 
first ,  i was under the impression that this game must be great because it is highly rated . 
it s very flimsy construction and it probably wore out just from plugging in and out for num_num months . 
but when it comes to space it s just too small . 
and some of the keys i use frequently just aren t there . bad move microsoft . 
these do not do a very good job at that . 
i got out a pin and pressed the reset button ,  but it didn t help . 
num_extend is . verify with the seller before you buy . ilearned the hard way . 
they ve fixed things for me before; they re pretty good . 
this oskri coconut and dark chocolate bar is far too sweet . 
here s what you gotta do every morning or night before bed if you want to make fresh ground coffee . 
the main reason is that it s simply unrealistic . 
i guess the liquid is not good at coloring like the powder form  for my hair  . 
they are dusty ,  which i could have easily washed off ,  but the scratches on them are unacceptable . 
my main complaint is uploading the operating system into the unit because the unit doesn t come with a cd . 
may as well buy generic brand chart paper . 
i ve been using that for a little less than a week now ,  and i absolutely love it . 
the material is itchy against the skin and is not durable at all . 
it even got infected and i was on antibiotics for num_num months . 
i think i can only use it as bedding for her . 
further buyers beware and spend the few extra bucks . 
these appear to be typical supplement puffery and nonsense which if done carefully are able to avoid fda scrutiny . 
i don t like throwing away appliances after such a short time . 
we have shrubs there which are always sporting birds and my cats love to watch them . 
i was warned that this product would break after a few months . 
its hard to put on ,  hard to take off ,  hard to keep on . 
that is pretty much what square enix did to this game . 
this is just a silly  and overpriced  idea to begin with . 
the idea ,  of course ,  is that one of them should work really well . 
so i am out looking for a pda for our budding high schooler . 
well ,  the num_extend set had the exact same issue . 
there are so many natural and cheaper skin remedies . 
i don t recommend this one there are better ones . 
i thought returning them and ordering again would solve the problem . 
junk set but what do expect for the price . 
this is a great game ,  make no mistake about it . 
it is comfortable ,  but it did not last well ,  and i cannot recommend it . 
the range of this device is terrible as well ,  and i lost the signal at about num_num feet away . 
i hope it s not too late before you read this . 
both of them split on the sides within num_num months . 
i guess you get what you pay for and i will probably be buying a better one soon . 
just opened num_num more packs and these seem dry and flaky like cake with too much flour . 
the usual problem is that the cpl falls apart . 
but age and those silver hairs that have a different texture have permanently altered my hair . 
too hard to empty into a small mouth container like a gas can . 
i just walk by it and it talks . 
i give amazon one star for not making this clear . 
i could just save them for cooler weather ,  but i m very unhappy with the snags . 
i purchased this product because my dog has had serious health issues . 
they shipped it by boat which took a month for it to arrive . 
i used about num_num drops which is standard for a good quality shaving oil . 
you cant get the bubbles out and if you try you will scratch the screen . 
the cd and dvd machine i bout to repair the disks was miserable failure . 
this shoe is great when walking ,  the arch support works extremely well . 
he s having fun with the ramp part but the gator doesn t work like it s supposed to . 
used it for a day then threw it away . 
she stopped using it until i unplugged it . 
bought this after reading in a review that it worked great for stainless steel . 
and it was a bit awkward to use . 
it may even be one of my least favorite tanning products period . 
it left egg residue in the cup even though i lubricated it first . i haven t tried it again . 
plus ,  i think it is teaching laziness to have an electronic toy reading books to our kids . 
kinda plan and cheap looking so not a fan threw it out . 
be warned ! the first issue is that its heavy and unstable . 
instead of a banana taste ,  this was mostly made of dates . 
nice to have a clock along with the timer . 
it really did taste too artificial . i won t be trying any other flavors . 
since they are made of cardboard ,  the the strings catch on the holes . 
it flips around or slides off to the side and accidentally activates the zire while in storage . 
the voice actors try their best to invigorate the terrible dialogue ,  but many fail . 
but is a great eye peace to use . 
only real good sight for paintball is the laser one . 
but there really is nothing great about it at all !  . 
this item was suggested when i purchased my num_extend platinum drinkwell pet fountain . 
bottom line ,  save the $ and just use plain water because the results will be the same !  . 
they were always a special treat that we truly enjoyed . 
we saw the great reviews but found it did not give a close shave . 
we got bored in a few rounds and went back to phase num_extend
you ll then be ranked according to how well you do . 
the grease fitting would not release from the zerk and ripped it right out of the ball joint assembly . 
i use the guard from a different mandoline . 
material was much lighter and felt cheaply made . 
yesterday i took it down and threw it in the trash . 
finally ,  the remaining bristles just pop out from the ferule .  .  . eeeew  .  .  .   this brush is my biggest regret !  . 
unfortunately ,  i was very disappointed when i only received one replacement pad instead of two . 
it was somewhat fixable but it really doesn t work the way it intended . 
i ordered this instead of the esbit stove i figured they were the same . 
this game was much more entertaining in it s time . 
he barks directly at the device almost challenging it . 
it is sharper than sand ! this was a disappointment . 
i m baffled as to why this product has received so many favorable reviews . 
although the slam dunk thing is basically worthless without a gamepad . 
after reading the comments that they are not the same i looked inside both . 
the fabric is very good as well as the color but it was too large . 
i beat it once ,  played through it a second time and tried to love it like the previous games . 
i got so sick of people asking me  what s that clicking sound ?   that i threw the stupid thing away . 
great little pump but its for presta valves only please note that . 
the oven knob just clicks when you turn it . 
i can t really say yet how well it works because i just opened the package . 
no need to start the player on the phone first . 
when it came back it jammed again on the first roll . 
hence i thought i need to use a complete system to cleanse ,  tone and treat my skin . 
it comes with the proper screws and pieces for mounting . 
but one can t judge every campbell s soup by the ones that one likes ,  it seems . 
really wish they had been like the old ones . 
i waited with baited breath for this game . 
must be a shipper problem ?  no longer on automatic reorder . 
you cannot chose what your opponent s ships will be . 
be careful when pressing down on the cutting lever or the assembly will fall off . 
these were not horrible but not good either  , t hey tasted more like plain fig newtons . 
when i returned to the doctor my enzymes were back to normal but so was my num_extend
i returned it !  i went swimming and it got wet internally . 
the front piece that goes over the face is soft and silky . 
unfortunately they have two major num_extend the prisms were not pointing in the same direction . 
i played the first few hours of this game in utter agony . 
every one of these coffees is totally superb . 
i m a big fan of the dockers signature series ,  but these fit much smaller that my other pairs . 
i looked in the packaging for information about how to get the ants . 
if you do repel fire boss  energy with recover . 
i tried to make it work and even called cuisinart for assistance . 
you have to also buy a memory card unlike xbox . 
the terrible feedback on the keyboard forces me to use the virtual keyboard on the phone . 
everything worked for num_num seconds ,  then died down . 
i discussed with our vet and researched the facial pheromone products extensively before deciding to try it . 
the strap has to plastic clips that clip on to nylon strap loops on both sides of the pouch . 
this is a good game which is nearly ruined by the game controls . 
in november num_num the battery no longer holds any charge . 
also ,  the rubber texture prevents the phone from slipping out of my hand . 
its actually what kept me playing the game and beating it . 
while it is cute ,  i will most likely be adding this to the charity box . 
no machine under a certain price removes scratches . 
i also would have preferred to have num_num toothbrushes instead of the finger brush . 
i tried opening them up and rubbing most of the seasoning off before baking them in the oven . 
it has a nice design ,  subtle and unique with the gold toe . 
this game doesn t give you the option of deciding which battles to fight . 
the result is a belt that constantly slides down due to the tug of stockings . 
i also appreciated more onboard storage and expandability since we re a four person family and i drive . 
it did come num_num in a pack and was shipped quickly and safely . 
it was a waste of time and money . 
i used to use seventh generation ,  but it leaves white residue on dishes . 
it seems they are not joined very well . 
so frustrating to see that happen .  . still ,  it s got merit . 
chis don t minimize frizz and their temp setting is iffy at best . trust me . 
no parts were preassembled ,  and no spares of the proprietary parts were included . 
the second one i got has intact contacts but the quality of it is terrible . 
this did not feel comfortable in my mouth . 
this is a cheaper version ,  and the wooden cars will not work with this track . 
even has a storage compartment for accessories and ammo . 
i did provide negative feedback on the seller  and got an abusive message in reply ,  thank you very much  . 
i m hard pressed to write a review for a piece of candy . 
people on the other site could not here me properly !  . 
i bought this expecting a high quality cord and mic for the $ price tag . 
the first is trivial ,  but since the game is new to the player ,  it s not awful . 
when i opened the box i saw that this new bottle didn t have the plastic seal around the top . 
it also sat up a lot higher on my wrist than i thought it would . 
if you really want to play it for some reason wait untill it costs less than $
because i cook omlettes every other day while on the road ,  i decided to buy one for my rv . 
the num_extend has only one brush head ,  no cord storage in the base ,  and no sensitive setting . 
 i m throwing it away so thank you amazon for your outstanding customer service . 
and you have to fumble around to open the  door  for the charger . 
it s simulated surround  derived from stereo signal  sent to rear speakers . 
bottom line ,  do not order this shirt online unless you have confirmed your size in a store first . 
it would be much better if the closure was on the back as this would eliminate both problems . 
will update if they are or aren t . if you buy ,  dig through it before using . 
the only thing these bristles could withstand is perhaps brushing a very weak air current . 
i just can t say anything good about this . 
also it won t brake as the bottle could because it is plastic . 
not learning of who the victim was is like having no body to a murder . 
had a little trouble syncing with my bluetooth  wouldn t let me pick up calls at first . 
maybe i expected to much from all the great reviews . 
whatever you do try the game before you buy it . 
i smelled the paste  that my dog spit out  and it made me gag . 
she doesn t chew it and we end up throwing away the pieces . 
i bought anoter sparkle case after this that was num_extend better . 
well my mother melted the power cord of my old one on a stove burner . 
this didn t help me at all and i wouldn t recommend it . 
the sound quality when used with the computer was very good . 
pancakes aren t evenly colored . perhaps the ridged side works better ,  because then the smooth side would be against the coils . 
absoluteiy unbearable  !  i had to remove the collar because i couldn t stand the odor . 
there was no any bonus  pillow set  ,  i had to purchase it num_extend
ordered num_num pair of these earrings ,  to use as gifts . 
i found myself very frustrated with the narrowness of this game ,  and don t recommend it to anyone . 
they were very loose on his paws ,  but very tight on his leg . 
they could make a difficulty setting for this game ,  and fix everything . 
not unless hoover backs it up with a num_num year warranty . 
i m not sure if the green version is any better ,  but i m disappointed . 
many fine textures and details such as woodgrain are almost completely lost . 
not a great mic ,  but if you need something realitively cheap ,  it ll do . 
i have had it for over a week . 
yes ,  it s a nice smell ,  but that s not the point . 
now when i pick him up ,  i notice a lot more hair coming off onto my shirt . 
i am diabetic and carbs turn in to sugar for energy . 
i m not sure they have perfected this technology !  . 
it can be made to work and that s about it . 
i bought crittertrail three after a wire in the last cage came apart . 
i really did not like this neutrogena ultra sheer sunblock mist . 
plus they must have a hate for bald pale guys . 
i ve got to find that stray hair and this isn t going to help . 
it only removed a small amount of dry skin and it was right back the next day . 
very well constructed but it has a design flaw that makes it useless . 
i mostly enjoy bold and extra taste coffees . 
i ve stopped using it as i m afraid my phone will break as it has fallen few times . 
i bought these to wear on a us to europe flight . 
cute toy ,  but my num_num month old twin grandaughters scrape the paint off the eye lid areas . 
not sure if that is what is leveraged in production ,  but pvc is a known carcinogen . 
the classic caramel is the one that amazon is sending out to unsuspecting buyers and it tastes awful . 
i had heard good reviews about this product so i picked it up . 
what a waste of time and effort on my part to install these   piles  . 
i think the roomba idea is wonderful ,  but the design needs some work . 
does not fit on my airsoft gun rail for starters . 
i was really duped by this sale and do not recommend others buying this item except directly from apple . 
i had been giving my dog an oatmeal biscuit or two each night . 
i ve been making and altering my own clothes since girlhood ,  and that was a while ago . 
i am having some problems with these ,  getting them to eject on cycling the action . 
congratulations corporate bean counters ,  you have destroyed another quality american brand . 
so ,  you may do well to skip this product completely . 
i requested a refund num_num minutes after opening the package so hopefully the seller will oblige . 
try a traditional uhf antenna to receive hdtv . 
it had a bitter taste to it that i really don t like in the sauces . 
then i used it to make num_extend filling it was difficult . 
honestly it was like a little film on my phone ,  very noticeable and very ugly . 
okay ,  this sounded like a cool idea and it is the first mio liquid i have ever tasted . 
accepts cheaper compact flash cards which are easily available in sizes upto num_extend
i was doing a stir fry on medium high heat . 
this isn t nearly as effective as other otc numbing ointments . 
i had no idea that this sunscreen was so difficult to remove . 
i don t need a rash and psoriasis to accompany it . 
we took care of this hose to great lengths . 
ea games on the other hand has burnout legends . 
pacific natural foods  almond milk has a weird taste and a worse aftertaste . 
as a result ,  my shoes were chaffing the back of my heel . 
i am now using an all natural cedar spray called evolv by wondercide . 
after that ,  a wire must have broken because one side of them stopped working . 
it became more of a spreadable consistency ,  but the grainy texture and the taste did not improve . 
i rated this item with one star due to my liking of a well balanced speakers . 
sent information about my system to ubisoft num_num days ago haven t heard from them yet . 
the design is also very weird and it is not easy to play with . 
clearly this maker is suffering from inconsistent manufacturing . 
so who s writing those reviews ? the thing is too slow !  it takes about num_num years to build a school . 
go to lakeshore learning for a better mic . 
diarrhea would be least of the problems but this can cause obstruction as they are not degradable . 
just use any angled liner brush instead  that doesn t shed !  if you can get a color match ,  great . 
the belt keeps sliding up no matter how tight i make it . 
gave num_num stars cause of the packing process . 
the childrens mode sometimes moves automatically ,  and sometimes goes to the same rooms over and over again . 
i ve owned two and around num_num months of moderate running use the smell moldy . 
just to get through the opening sequence takes about num_num minutes of dialog . 
i then purchased a screwpull which i remember fondly from when my mom owned one . 
a bit flimsy and deosn t quite do the job . 
it foams too much as well as it is not of thick consistiency . edited :  january num_extend num_extend
at least num_num inches of material past my fingers and nearly a half foot past my groin . 
the creative muvo earbuds that came with my num_extend player are much better these sennheiser s . 
discovered that the mugs are imported from china . 
the thing is i keep my bike in the garage when not in use . 
after a week ,  the metal color decoration is fall off very easily . 
the metal ones are about the same price ,  they don t break ,  and sound way better . 
it just didnt taste like the ones ive had . 
even then ,  i d look for a better product in any price range . 
bought a similar tool made from a different manufacturer and it worked perfect . 
i thought this would be a good alternative . 
you can do up to num_num treatments in a row ,  on different pimples . 
there should have been a small gap left so that the protector could lay flat and adhere . 
i was sent a product that had been opened and returned . 
thank you amazon .  .  . i hope they stop using this merchant . 
these lees are clunky looking and a bit too large ,  though i ordered my usual size . 
i am very disappointed in my last shipment of kashi go lean crunch . 
i bought num_num large ones ,  i will not buy more ,  until they improve the material ,  and the weak frame . 
like the num_num scents that it came with   vanilla ,  orange ,  lime  . 
i loved this case and had lots of people comment on it . 
maybe i just had bum luck ,  but another reviewer noted needed it cleaned after several weeks . 
i have made modifications with epoxy and it works but you should not have to do this . 
but it doesnt have the best lcd screens and its tough to see whats going on inside it . 
i do love this brand and would buy it in ohter colors . 
i bought these pellets to plink around with my new airgun . 
i like other products from this brand and had a big hope when this one arrived timely . 
i bought this stove around a year and a half ago . 
the flavor is barely there and tastes more like a rice cake than the flavor says . 
end result :  more cleanup to do when you are num_extend
this is the same problem i have had with other portable sony radio products . 
instead ,  skip it and go immediately to perfect dark . 
it stings slightly as i use the towelette on my face . 
it s a shame as i really wanted it to work . 
there are nicer models that you can purchase . 
this thing ,  despite being designed for pets ,  is clearly not designed for animals with claws . 
i don t know why the other reviewers keep saying the  teflon is flaking off  . 
jason needs to make this product without any perfume scent . 
the replacement was better but the focus adjustment  pin  sheared on the fouth time using the binoculars . 
it seemed to work okay at first ,  after a few months i ve noticed some problems with num_extend
i had to crank the windage waaaaaaay off to the left to get it on target . 
not sure if this really does anything it claims . 
i have ghost armor on my ipad num_extend
quality reflects the price ,  very thin metal band . 
though hollow plastic i felt it was designed to hold a camper from rolling and it did . 
if i connect it ,  and leave the cord fully retracted ,  it does not charge . 
i might buy them again ,  but the size would have to be different . 
enemie num_num clock !  got him ! got him !  dont even look at this game on the shelf . 
after one wear the stitching is stretched and honestly i m afraid to wash them .  .  .  . don t waste your money !  . 
it doesn t smell fruity good  like i expected based on other reviews  and it doesn t hold that great . 
it has the holes covered up with rubber . 
i m not sure why this has such good reviews . 
leaving me no choice other than to throw the pair s  away . 
may be the one that sent to me is broken ,  but i threw it to the trash . 
these guys have missed the boat !  bad news . 
this is an okay product . firstly ,  the product was not as pictured . 
i don t mind noisy toys ,  but this one is grating to my ears . 
num_num countries around the world require that gmos be labeled . 
text had serious ghosting and there was an overall red tint . 
you will be lost without completing the tutorial which is tricky . 
obviously not impossible for a dedicated bug  . for about num_num months i hardly ever saw an ant in the bowl . 
it was a little bit of a pain to extract it and the adapter bent easily during the process . 
this was not compatible with several of my components ,  and the learning memory was far too small . 
i ll save you the trouble ,  you can t make one . 
in super mario world you just have unusual worlds such as chocolate island and forest of illusion . 
you can t expect high quality or flattering fit . 
so every time that happened ,  my husband or i had to attach it for him . 
supporting this game is like supporting the idea that ea thinks you re stupid . 
i did return it and the company did take care of it . 
i wonder what kind of residue was transferred to the cleaning cloth . 
it could be a case by case situtation . you cannot sleep with it . ended up donating . 
it dripped at a rate of num_extend drops per second . 
it was cute for some time ,  but just wasn t worth the effort . 
the consistency is lumpy and the smell is overpowering . 
so i called customer service this morning to find out how to get the grinder unstuck . 
the flavor was too strong in this product . 
they may have bunched up because they were so big . 
i have viking stainless steel appliances ,  and there is no way this is remotely the same type of metal . 
it clogged them up terribly when any residue flushed down them . 
most portable heaters have fans to draw cold air in and blow hot air out . 
even then ,  the shave is not very close . 
i do not recommend these because they do not roll well at all . 
big mistake !  the eight is tiny ,  fits more like a num_extend
my new growth seems to be ok ,  but all else is drier than it has ever been . 
i was surprised ,  so i repeated the test ,  and got the same results . 
don t waste your time or money ,  it is a dud . 
the multiplayer was one of the best to date ,  and the overall game was really good . 
however ,  this brand is nothing special ,  and i would not purchase it at any price . 
bought to transfer photos out of my samsung phone . 
it needs a lock button or something that prevents it from coming apart unless you want it to . 
sadly i put it right in front while i was getting the tank right for the fish . 
there are things i liked ,  things i didn t like ,  and it was just an  ok  gaming experience . 
i would have thought this game would have died out after the first . 
so then i waited for my energy to cease yielding and my focus to uncloud . 
if yours are from lack of sleep ,  get more sleep . 
so now i have a whole box of coffee k cups that i don t know what to do with . 
i don t normally have sensitive skin ,  but i ve never really put much product on it . 
because the price was so little it is not worth the cost to exchange or return . 
it feels like putting vicks on my face . 
with new buckles i think the arrangement would be fine . 
you can throw enemies ,  fly ,  beat up more enemies ,  throw cars ,  fly . 
it bent the first time i used it on a relatively light piece of pie . 
password protection and encryption process is a convoluted mess . 
personal taste is subjective ,  but i just didn t like this soup at all . 
this marble run ,  and similar varieties by quercetti sold by amazon ,  target ,  and other stores ,  is terrible . 
why settle for icewind dale ii when you can get so much more for the same price ?  . 
yes ,  these hooks look great but  only in the shower  if you get my drift . 
also when i ordered it it did not fit my iphone num_num the way it should have . 
they say num_extend but i couldn t even button them . 
disappointing because it looks perfect for cheese and crackers . 
do not waste your time with this earbud . 
doesn t work with projector  monitor  and switching between num_num computers ,  i think because one of the kvm cables broke . 
the guar gum is a thickener ,  like cornstarch . 
the pump finally died and i could not find a replacement pump . 
i give it a bonus star just because it was great fun watching the effect . 
they were kind of a waste of my money to me . 
i also think the price is a little steep considering you only get num_num capsules . 
i am so disappointed in the quality of this item . 
it didn t fit my phone and i was unhappy . 
after i installed this software and the drivers ,  the card would not work . 
everything is free of  most  allergens ,  even most allergens . 
the clip breaks that attaches the toy to the string . 
i ve tried using a microfiber and terry cloth towel . 
moreover ,  i imagine had i tried grain ,  it would taste like that :  grain and berries . 
i purchased a finum brewing basket and prefer that to this . 
i opened up the package and put in the num_num min smooth it serum ,  it smelled horrible . 
i m not sure what it does; i don t think it did anything for a sore throat . 
i had been needing a place for my phone to go ,  thinking this was the place . 
the heatwave that they send you with this toy does not transform . 
the kinivo also consistently had an easier time connecting to my iphone . 
it did nothing to heal the canker sore . 
the animals are left with half a head or three legs . 
what s even more disturbing is this is an old problem . 
and today s game makers can t achieve this ? graphics average . 
my son plays with my acer tablet all the time and i have apps for him . 
if it weren t for all the other problems ,  i d say these were good ear buds . 
seriously ,  granite gold ?  ?  ?  more like water on granite . 
if you want something that works and tells time choose something else . 
as english literature concentrates on shakespeare ,  so orthomolecular therapy concentrates on vitamin c . 
i am unsure what happened but i got horrible acne . 
i feel like it took the life out of my hair rather than the other way around !  . 
there is a vast amount of filtration media to use in hob filters . 
ended up going to marshall s and getting much higher quality jean for half the price . 
bbq baked lays are packed with so much flavor . these popchips taste like slightly burnt airpocket chips . 
it was super shiny and sturdy . but the handle was sooo bad i had to return it . 
however ,  i found the size was too big when going one size up . 
was very disappointed !  !  was expecting the item to be in silver because that s what the picture show on online . 
it s actual color seems to be whatever your body s color is !  . 
if you do not have experience soldering tiny pins etc . 
the fighting and movement controls were okay ,  but could have been more fluid . 
i also did not get a headache like i did with the clementine num_extend stars for the grapefruit . 
did i mention i have a wide head ?  i can t believe this is happening . 
i try all different brands all the time . 
a good spinner will leave the leaves almost entirely dry ,  and gorgeously ready to use . 
even when it does work there s no visual clue it s finally cut through fully . 
the color is rich ,  the weight is solid and the overall durability seems very good . 
i wouldn t dare walk around smelling like this . 
otherwise ,  iron deficiency is uncommon in men ,  children ,  and postmenopausal women . 
i thought i would purchase a cup of this upon happening upon it in the local grocery store . 
but ever the optomist ,  i decided that i should give it a try . 
they had a fancy num_num layer pattern on top to make them like an old fashioned movie reel . 
so ,  the sides are less flexible than the regular tuli s . 
currently i rate this game bad been following and think the game itself looks like it has great potential . 
i have short ,  layered hair and thought this dryer would add some volume but nothing changed . 
worse is that replacement bulbs are not tobe found anywhere . for slightly more money there are far better options available . 
if you like flavor ,  go with any other cup but this one . 
then it switched :  type  j  and you d get a  k  . 
my dog ripped this apart after a few games of fetch . 
i really wanted to like this feeder ,  but i don t . 
this coffeemaker has only been in use for only num_num year . 
if you want a better gta clone just get crackdown . 
good luck resisting the urge to break your controller and the disc in half . 
it does not seem to do much other than float in the water . 
i ve never played any of the other homeworld games ,  but i hope the first is better than this one . 
the only good thing i can say is that it doesn t have an odor at all . 
thought price was attractive ,  figured even if private supplier ,  if coming from amazon warehouse they d be ok . 
a complete waste of money do not bother with this game . 
sadly ,  i had to give the headset to my father . 
great for making a batch of stock but certainly too big for dinner for two people . 
the pain was excruciating and it felt like my sphincter was having convulsions . 
i bought this player new about num_num months ago . 
update : chances are you aren t going to buy this ,  since the latest reviews are num_num years old . 
there s also a few flat surfaces of like material that on which you can also draw . 
the walgreens brand of inserts provided endless comfort . 
it looks like the edge of the fabric is unraveling . 
i was torn between this stove and the esbit one . 
what s with the teeny tiny indicator light ?  give us back the big flashing blue circle from the num_extend
i got this as a gift for someone and it broke on the first use . 
when i tried these  for nighttime wear  i was not impressed with the sound resistance or the fit . 
otherwise ,  stick to other chews until something s been done about this nasty issue . 
poor guy was still as jumpy and upset as before . 
do not buy this ,  or you will be out postage to return the thing . 
i bought this thinking it would be a nice little chopper for herbs ,  garlic or parmesan cheese . 
this is probably the worst crayola product i have ever purchased . 
can you get num_extend in short ,  the bra is well constructed and comfortable . 
i m not about to risk my dogs life or health waiting to find out . 
good chewing but .  .  .  .  . they made my puppy sick and he barfed five times . 
well guess what ?  it s the same thing for video games . 
this would be a very cool product if it worked . 
if you don t have a vue brewer ,  keep scrolling . 
yet we can all reasonably presume that these fillers and byproducts probably aren t that expensive to source . 
if tupperware had not changed their design of the measuring cups .  .  .  . i would have ordered those . 
i would not feed this product to my dogs on a regular basis ,  if at all . 
many times bunnies that are supposed to hop don t hop . 
i have to remove the battery ,  wait for num_num seconds and insert it again to reset the num_extend
i ve owned two escort solo num_num radar detectors . 
celtics or even double dribble and you can get the same appeal as this piece of junk . 
once it s on toilet ,  it s hard to clean . 
i have num_extend rounds through my num_num with a fiber optic front sight . 
but it s by no means tasty . drinking this was a challenge . 
mixing was no issue whatsoever using a blender ball shaker . 
i thought this would fix that problem by ringing loudly right above my head . 
the white pat around yoshi s shell is felt . 
i will keep it as an extra and because i got a good amazon price . 
once i took it apart to clean ,  it never sealed properly again . 
players can take missions for money ,  exp and faction points . 
it was a shame because i liked the simplicity of the bowl itself . 
good to go ,  as i hand wash my dishes . 
i love these pens but they broke to fast . 
i ve literally tried everything ,  read everything i could on the subject ,  talked to her trainer about it ,  etc . 
really ?  who blends this stuff and decides that it is good ?  ugh . 
if amazon fixes the back i would give this product num_num stars  based on my limited experience with it . 
i really cant tell how easily mine are going to break in . 
but based on the reviews i decided to try these for my shih tzus . 
my next purchase will be a lexar card and i hope i wont be dissapointed again . 
it s labeled  dark chocolate  ,  which it is ,  but it s also very ,  very bland . 
i purchased this as a bag to take to the hospital . 
i bought this by mistake and had to return it . 
i have the charger at the back of the sink behind the radio and out of the way . 
the company rep i spoke with was very nice and recommended i call the service guy in my town . 
i ve just used it num_num times :  three cars num_num home stereo ,  just to probe it doesn t work . 
did not work !  i have to take it to a sony certified dealer for repair . 
do not leave in meat in an oven or bbq . 
my original cable does not require me to forcibly yank out the cord . 
i ve used nature s way hawthorn berries before with great effect ,  but not this time . 
i hope it isn t my imagination ,  but upgrading the software made the unit a little softer . 
i ve tried many ginger teas and this one is by far the best tasting . 
i wear a size num_num jean and there was no way i could get these on . 
i m approaching num_num so i thought maybe it s good to start treating those dark spots before they got worse . 
i have had to restart this thing up to num_num times just to brew num_num pot of coffee . 
i remember how fast it was on the ata bus . 
perhaps i ordered the wrong size ,  but you could see my back fat in this bra . 
i am an adult that has a tube in my ear and i own a swimming pool . 
so i have been buying and trying all the other sugarless chocolate bars i can find . 
i read all about how to care for them and season them . 
the directions say to spray onto dry ,  flaky or irritated skin and coat .  .  . which i do . 
first the corners started to peel ,  then the whole thing started to come off . 
when comparing the two ,  it s as though they weren t even built by the same company . 
i used it in the past and it seemed to only make my pimples worse . 
i would not recommend this product at all to anyone . 
that should ve told me this monitor had problems even if it was a matter of getting a lemon . 
it was very sweet and not refreshing at all . 
after num_extend months in the sun it rotted out . 
given the company s reputation ,  i was severely disappointed with the quality of these pants . 
linksys tech support was no help other than confirming that it won t work with many printers . 
tried this for a month with no results . 
when i microwaved the plates the higher sides did not heat up so it was easy to take out . 
comes apart easily using the thumb screws ,  but don t use it as a rest when at the range . 
try one of those first if squirrels are a pest . 
the ones that come with them can barely support the weight of a bike . 
first of all you will be shocked at how suddenly they break . 
i don t know what it is supposed to taste like . 
this rolling pin was clumsy and awkward to use . 
other thanthat ,  the protection for the device is top notch . 
the colors is so beautiful but the one i received was so dry is was unusable . 
i needed it that weekend for the party so the hassle of returning it wasn t going to happen . 
i purchased avon glimmer stick in black and brown . 
dont think im some jerk ,  though ,  i loved this game at first . 
if i wear these all day i d actually get blisters . 
you will appreciate mario and sonic more ,  but that still won t get you your money back . 
it was cheap and you get what you pay for . 
and connected it my phone and it didn t work after that . 
the reset sw should allow this but ,  alas ,  it does not work as stated by others . 
the entire reservoir must be heated to num_num deg . 
it s a shame that the part that screws onto the cage is hard plastic . 
it turned out to be highly uncomfortable for me and i immediately returned it . 
this morning i had sunbutter on gluten free bread . 
now ,  i have a flash based player . if you re really considering this . 
fun !   .  .  . avoid these and go with verbatim ,  ridata or almost anything else . 
spend the money and get a higher quality cutter . 
again ,  we were able to rearrange and continue using . 
i got it and it was very worn . 
neat how you don t have to remove the cover to use the scope . 
the arrived and felt like thin cheap plastic . 
try a different product from a different company . 
and the shave isn t close so it feels like a waste of time . 
we purchased this toy for our num_num year old for christmas . 
not worth all the trouble to me so i gave all of them away to my niece . 
before purchasing ,  i checked and double checked that this would work with my magazines . 
i really wish i could give this product num_num stars ,  i really do . 
if you are looking for a shooter ,  i would stay away from splinter cell and go with something else . 
and with only half ,  this bag was about % bigger than my fully stuffed toiletry bag . 
it is already in the process of being shipped so i can t cancel the order . 
my mom s finger nail went right through it too so the material is very ,  very thin . 
once i stopped giving cat the vitamin ,  his vomiting problem stopped right away . 
i would say it would be good for very petite dogs . 
this kit seems like more of a hassle than it was worth . 
the num_extend is a power hog ,  so it won t work with passive usb hubs . 
this stuff does nothing but make a mess . 
the levels and all the different combinations and weapons will keep you playing for a while . 
the color saturation on the lids is only moderate at best . 
i ordered more than one ,  and none of them worked . 
sometimes it works fine ,  but then other times ,  either i can t hear the caller or they cant hear me . 
i think they should also do better in the amazon product description and on the unilever website . 
i tried this toy with him ,  but it didn t last very long . 
you think you are getting a great deal ,  but you are getting taken . 
i think i m going to try wella toner . 
in fact they are a little on the green side . 
if it weren t for the additives ,  it wouldn t have any taste at all . i ve never had blue crab . 
it wouldn t be bad if it stayed together . 
i needed a new headset  my blueant is so small and light i constantly lose it  . 
its too bad its been drm crippled and dumbed down . 
very disappointing !  since the product maker won t specify this deficiency the amazon description should . 
i used it once and then it didn t work . 
please ,  do not be mislead by the product title and description ,  as i was . 
thought kong was a good quality name .  .  . but this toy is junk . 
i no longer think shea is the miracle ingredient that it has been touted to be . 
she easily ripped one of the seams then proceeded to pull most of the stuffing out . 
i can not recommend this because of how quickly it has started to deteriorate . 
coconut is probably the best ,  in terms of delivering a good flavor with minimal after taste . 
i hate not getting what i paid for . 
the best bra in my mind is one i can forget i have on ,  and this wasn t it . 
i found it useless and a waste of money . 
i bought num_num of these ,  figuring if they lasted a couple months each ,  i d have years worth of cables . 
this stuff did not work very well at all . 
i m having a bit of  buyers remorse  from this purchase . 
well ,  even with all of the sugar in this ,  the baby wouldn t touch it . 
whoever designed this should be tarred and feathered !  not worth $ the price of a good card . 
changing the setting doesn t have any impact on the consistency of toasting . 
any help would be appreciated from those residing in wisconsin or of swiss lineage . 
it has become everquest in space ,  or  everstar galaxies questwars  as we call it . 
it also containing a whopping % of your daily fat intake . 
i literally opened the package ,  saw that it didnt fit ,  and threw it in the trashcan . 
i tried using it in the oatmeal raisin cookie recipe listed on the back of the bag . 
if your pigs are fat and too healthy buy this to remedy that . 
i was really happy when this item was delivered and planned a meal where it would get used . 
like most photographers ,  i ve owned a ton of bags . 
gave it a few shakes to get it going again ,  but it stopped in about num_num seconds . 
the quarterback and receivers are the right shape and size and the linemen are chunky like they should be . 
i thought since this thing will play bedtime music it would work well in a crib . 
it looks fantastic and the controls ,  menus and ease of use are incredible . 
the second time we played ,  gus didn t inflate at all . 
it s warped badly ,  cracked on one side ,  and has a rough finish . 
simply not enough openings to allow proper air flow . 
the connector fell apart on the first use . 
we just got this ,  and put it together ,  so i figured i d review it . 
if not for that difficulty ,  i d have given it a num_extend because it would work great . 
big fan of otterbox cases ,  i had the commuter series on my num_extend
mgs was great but the last two have been horrible and not a lot of fun . avoid . 
we complained to the company via email right away but haven t heard back and it has been several days . 
but it s got too much filler and fat in it to be really healthy . 
this like my front scope covers do not stay closed well while in use . 
my old one i ve used to pick up easily five pounds and more . 
i chalked it up to a lesson learned . 
i have changed water ,  filter media ,  etc and started from scratch ,  water still gets cloudy . 
a paper clip literally is less bendable than these . 
even when i can get it to work ,  it often needs to be turned off and on multiple times . 
don t waste your time and money on it . 
by the way ,  handspring technical support is probably the second worst i ve ever encountered . 
this product ,  however ,  did not meet with their usually high standards . 
i suspect it will be played with for a week or so then discarded . 
the smell while it s cooking actually is very strong and can make a person nauseated quite easily . 
the wheel in the middle keeps falling off . 
i thought it maybe was gonna turn a darker blue or something but nope !  !  !  it turned bright ,  hot pink . 
if it was a grittier sponge it may have worked better . 
i does not stay in place at all . 
there are two to three games that i will buy without having played every year . 
on top of this ,  it has star force protection ,  which is a major problem . 
i have a grabber i ve owned for decades and use it nearly every day . 
the sheath is plastic and useless for a boot knife since the entire thing comes out when pulling . 
the burning was like a chemical burn that needed to be neutralized . 
the price was right but that was the only thing that was right . 
the num_num degree turn to fit the ear bud turns the wrogn way so it pops off too easily . 
be careful to firmly tighten this when you change valve type or find it loose . 
the mouse buttons are not buttons at all but long thin plastic strips . 
after that hard boot ,  i was able to get all the files copied and installed . 
i do not have any special diets that i need to eat by ,  just buying these on a whim . 
the graphics are horrible and the controls are cheap . 
there s all kind of free fan sites out there like num_extend with tons of downloads . 
these mini battery chargers do work ,  but they are extremely slow . 
you must supply your own charger which thenplugs into the back of the device . 
so ,  if you have to carry it up num_num flights of stairs like he did ,  it is manageable . 
the chemical mixes had such offensive ingredients ,  we used our own mix . 
it s no better than my old crt monitor and in some situations the color is worse . 
i would highly recommend stormy seas which is also a game of balance but much better made . 
i usually use urban decay s complexion primer potion ,  which is awesome . 
i must say ,  like lucypye that mine basically rotted out all its strength in the sun after a year . 
i like that it doesn t produce too many suds and doesn t have a strong smell . 
i dont need any cooling device fro my num_extend
the color is more orange than i thought it would be . 
after all ,  who could screw up star wars ? well ,  now i have the answer to that question . 
it s definitely worth it to put in a few extra bucks to know that your expensive gadget is safe . 
i used this product until the bottle was finished ,  which lasted over a year . 
if support for these two formats are the selling feature for you ,  be warned ,  you should look elsewhere . 
fortunately ,  the pack only includes five bottles of cherry flavor ,  so it wasn t a complete waste . 
honeywell makes money by doing nothing ,  and kaz makes money by doing very little . 
i guess if you want to keep raking in the money you have to fudge and mislead folk . 
and the kids often ended up frustrated within a few minutes . 
after about num_num mins my ears started to ache from the pressure of the headphones . 
i think it sucked that only two characters were in vehicles . 
once wet ,  they stay that way for days literally . 
i was thrilled to have something for quick jobs . 
but the fact that the action is so incredibly hard really hurts the game . 
i am returning this item to amazon ,  and i ll continue my search for set of an affordable ,  quality knives . 
next time i ll just find a num_extend ping pong ball somewhere . 
i bought this curling wand set about a year and num_num months ago  april num_extend
i had decided before even purchasing it that i was going to secure it to the floor with screws . 
i just ended up purchasing another type and i made one as well . 
and so i could not consistently see the numbers . 
very akward for her so i am getting a new one . 
even though i have lots left ,  i m giving up on this and going to purchase e . l . f . 
i was able to jump right into a multiplayer game with no lag . 
i also didn t have any leaking issues  which i worried about  in my purse . 
save money ,  buy crushed walnut for snake aquariums instead . 
these horse pills do not appear to be working for this healthy hair having african american woman . 
but after a couple of uses in the city ,  the connection starts to falter and become inconsistent . 
send a little more money and get a more flexible tubing so you can work with it . 
the newer ones aren t what the old ones were . 
this piece of clothing is a mess all the way around . 
it was overwhelming whichever room we kept it in . 
$ discount ,  but i have to buy a $ adapter . 
i am sorry i even tried it because it just feeds the monster . 
tried it on my printer and printing stopped halfway through . 
level is everything ,  and i mean everything in this game . 
the liquefied version of some jello that i would not classify as peach or tea inspired . 
for the money i was disappointed too i only received one other places give you two or three . 
i guess that helps them stay on your head ,  but it didn t work for me . 
my one year old got these for christmas ,  they were broken num_num months later . 
i decided to just go with it however ,  and after a month the brush head became very loose . 
i bought this drying straightener and was just thrilled with the way it worked ,  the first time . 
the product quality is fantastic ,  great ingredients ,  great manufacturing process and overall would be a great product . 
they don t feel as comfortable as the aqua sphere goggles but they are also great goggles . 
i have no way of knowing that but i just am not a fan of moroccan oil . 
of course the problem is with the oem software there is zero versatility . 
talking about this game makes me lose my temper so i m going to quit now . 
first of all the story mode is beatable in about num_num minutes . 
i like the color ,  but this product burnt my lip , so i stopped use this product . smell like perfumery . 
don t waste your money on this at this price . 
there are no instructions and no way to figure it out . 
the last postion of the stem ,  the hack setting does not work . 
this is definitely not a belgian waffle maker .  .  . can only make old fashioned thin waffles . 
i tried to shim it it but the front was just way higher than the back !  . 
i am by no means a professional photographer . 
also it might help to lower the averaged rating . 
i have pretty normal feet ,  but these socks are apparently not designed for the human foot . well ,  ok ,  no biggy . 
i purchased this product after reading the positive reviews . 
they do seem appropriate for a child just starting to learn to use a mouse and keyboard . 
it somehow locked on the open position after one day of use . 
give me the business then replied ,  differ from man to man the merchandise . 
i briefly owned an original jawbone in num_extend
after i get home ,  i hang it up ,  and it s dry by the next day . 
i can t see any difference in the size of my lips . 
eyecups too rigid so i cut them off . 
there is your proof . google  virginia pilot rothco military lawsuit .   this article is about a bulk order the u . s . 
he has played with it a total of maybe num_num hours . 
the rinsing helped to alleviate the swelling ,  redness ,  and pain . 
i have never in my life actually thrown away a full product ,  until this one . 
it makes me look like a dead person . 
i ll take a guess and say we have used this machine num_num times or so . 
just not a good product ,  avoid at all costs . 
basically ,  it gave me a year of service . 
i tried a couple of planets  i think they were planets  and same thing . 
as for some people and the issue with balance and weight . 
synthetic vitamins may actually do more harm than good . 
i liked the scent  hence num_num stars instead of num_extend
i bought this thinking it would be easier to grate my nutmeg or other hard spices . 
half life works on the pc and has a truly excellent interface . 
lasted about num_num months before it burned out . 
in fact ,  sally hansen extreme is my favorite drugstore polish . 
then the nice black numbers started to disappear . 
i found myself walking more often than not ,  just to spare myself the trouble . the morality system is also lacking . 
i ve made pizza before and never had problems making the dough and having it rise . 
as such ,  i am comfortable learning the conditions my plants need and whether i can meet them . 
it s also fair to note ,  i ve only used ambi consistently for the past two weeks . 
i was dissapointed ,  being a huge fan of the show . 
if you like num_extend person shooters ,  buy socom num_extend num_extend or wait for num_extend
very pretty but it was shipped in poor conditions and many of the rhinestones were missing . 
this treatment seems to work for many people ,  but it hasn t worked well for me . 
so i bought a much higher quality brand and it worked no problem . 
way too strong of a scent ,  and a horrible scent at that . 
this would increase the cost of the pin but the result is no rust ,  flaking from the rod ,  etc . 
the teflon coating on the plates finally started peeling off ,  so it was time to replace it . 
even after months of use this issue continues . 
i was more satisfied with a cheap sephora eye make up remover than this one . 
i hadn t got halfway through my first application and it had already dried up . 
i loved the game gear ,  for another year if that  or num_num months  when the screen went out again . 
first i ll say that num_num of the num_num doesn t work at all . 
this is much thicker than i expected it to be which is a good thing . 
it s compact ,  heats up quickly ,  and has a lid that allows you to save oil . 
i finger detangled and that wasn t very productive with this conditioner . 
i can say that the belt clip on this was bound to fail . 
calls keep coming in ,  the thing is a dust collector . maybe people will read this and save money and frustration . 
i am unable to connect my dell and the print server to the network . 
perhaps in a different car it may work better . 
don t buy it until they fix the problem . 
so i watched as the little mouse tail racheted about here and there for a little while . 
table sugar  sucrose  is the very first thing on the product ingredient list . 
why would they send a small top and a large bottom ?  it was huge !  . 
i got the case and amazon shipped the item fast and i got it in num_num days . 
wish they could eliminate the scent . can only give one star . 
the picture shows them much bigger than they are . 
i don t get these num_num star reviews unless they have dull taste buds or stock in the company . 
my skin was relatively clear except for some acne on my jawline . 
also ,  the envelope to hold the brush is a rough texture and gets dirty easily . 
if i can return this knife ,  i will . 
that is a rule i have always heard in retail . apparently in the video game world of retail . 
for the longest time i had no idea why . 
from the inside insert the cable s end through the hole and back in through the second hole . 
put the phone in m pocket ,  pull it out and half the screen cover was peeled off . 
but this was the very first use and it s not like i put excessive pressure on it . 
i m somewhat busty and have muscular arms so i m generally a large in button up shirts . 
i decided to measure it; it was num_extend across and num_extend lengthwise . 
again ,  the liver needs continuous breaks from being overloaded with niacin and alcohol . 
anyway ,  returned it and ordered a different one . 
so unless you re just looking for the rubber dingy ,  forget it . 
love lezyne products and found that they are more durable and easier to use . 
buyer beware . the jaybird sportsband is a far superior product in almost every way . jaybird sportsband bluetooth headphones  midnight black  . 
unfortunately ,  i did not have a need to open it up and use it until today . 
i was actually disappointed in the flavor of this half and half . 
the software still ran but never allowed me to reserve the printer . 
i wanted to love it ,  but it didn t help my itchy bichon at all . 
they are available on amazon . com for $ for num_num months worth of filters ,  no thanks . 
vibrates and buzzes when you re driving with no num_extend
ordered a hamilton beach from wal mart with a $ num_num year extended warranty . 
however these big ones my dog ,  my friends dog ,  and my neighbors dog hated . 
it is very disjointed and is hardly enjoyable . 
but this game ,  ow my ,  it s the worst game i have ever ,  ever played . 
if you are considering buying this game ,  i reccomend you try it before you buy it . 
it was very expensive and there was absolutely no change in our kitten s aggressive behavior . 
i installed fresh batteries in the robot and started it up . 
i try different brands all the time and look for the following num_extend
it only works for the first couple times . 
well ,  i pulled the tabs as directed ,  but there was no squeak from either mouse . 
my skin is very sensitive and applying fondation equalled deep exfoliation for me . 
both had quality issue  the tv s remote died once  . 
some holes too big ,  not drilled deep enough ,  holes too big so pieces fall out . 
in the num_num yrs of life i have never had this problem before . 
with realms num_extend it took all of the good things from realms num_num and got rid of them . 
when i called this company no one ever answers the phone . 
there is a white computer generated sticker on the package that says belkin but nothing on the product itself . 
this made a good bargain into a not so good one . 
it takes forever to dry and even afterward remains sticky . 
they are herbivores and are not designed to process dairy products . 
scientists say high fructose corn syrup is addictive as cocaine . 
ice cream but ,  way better than the peanut butter . 
they were crunchy but had no taste like a cashew should taste . 
i would recommend spending a little more and getting a better knife . 
these would be better if they weren t so darn small . 
last night i went to look at these . 
she instantly had a very bad skin reaction and jumped out of the water crying . 
this skirt covered only half my body !  had to give it away .  .  . very disappointed . 
not good !  they do have vitamin c and that is about all i can say is good about them . 
i prefer wen mist to this quack wax . 
while my old apex ,  still playing strong ,  is silence for the same disc . 
the characters have a motion that somehow allows a num_extend cartoon character to come alive . 
i m now looking for a mini donut or bunt pan . 
the design of this one is exactly as pictured . 
not my top choice for a scrubber in my kitchen sink . 
since it was on a raid system ,  no big deal . 
normally ,  toms are about a size too big num_extend if you normally wear num_extend etc  . 
i have given up on this piece of junk and will search for a more reliable product . 
the other end slipped onto the connector as would be expected . poor quality control . 
however ,  the game has a number of technical problems that render it unplayable in its current form . 
i guess i would look for an alternative router if i were you . 
i am a big fan of reconditioned units . 
this s mores maker does work but the problem lies in storing so many pieces . 
we have used other brands and never had this problem . 
i read some reviews that it smells like horse urine . 
better yet ,  stick with the num_extend version !  believe me ,  you ll be glad you did !  ! p . s . 
the quality of the plastic is about the same as a pair of little children s sunglasses . 
if you want to rent this because it s short ,  rent wolverine instead . 
i thought i was buying a hitachi wand . 
they have really good products ,  but this one ,  i actually threw it away ,  and i never throw anything away . 
i am very disappointed with the product and would return it if it was possible . 
i wish i hadn t ordered them but for the price i ll just throw them away for a bad try . 
my old ones never wore out and i bought them in num_extend
it also attracts dust too easily ,  making it hard to get on almost bubble free . 
it s the noisiest thing in my house ,  and that ,  unfortunately ,  is no exaggeration . 
my dog really wanted to love this toy . 
i have to say though that the steak i cooked on this thing was really really good . 
my kids ,  num_num and num_extend have been bugging me to get this for months ,  so i reluctantly caved . 
so if you don t have confident of installing it yourself ,  don t . 
it still works ,  it just isn t as attractive . 
then we got a second dog ,  a puppy . 
the concept is good and may work for others . 
this speaker is all boomy ,  and it muddled my jazz music . 
i read in an online forum to try baby shampoo ,  to treat my hair gently . 
i have an apex num_num and i loved it to this date . 
this was the first hamburger bun we found after our celiac diagnosis . 
but i guess you get what you pay for . 
the bracket this comes with is way bigger than it needs to be . 
the warranty statement on the packaging is just for show because this company does not exist . 
these peanuts include cottonseed oil ,  a hydrogenated oil . 
rather ,  i am disappointed that in contacting the manufacturer it was confirmed that the supplier had changed . 
i have a problem with heavy chemical laden cleaners ,  so i tend to avoid them . 
i ve only had it about six weeks and just noticed the stylus end is torn . 
i ended up returning it as i got a different one than was described . 
extremely lightweight and flimsy ,  the base doesn t feel like it would survive an accidental drop . 
it is okay on my rebel xti ,  but not wide enough to be impressive . 
i found it uncomfortable to lie on and i got no relief . 
there is a patch out that fixes it . 
but that does not mean others will not like it . 
if you like the taste of watered down minty cocoa ,  this is for you . 
i received my product very quickly but it came busted in the packaging . 
the front tho .  . seemed right length but the back seems a bit short ,  and the straps were too tight . 
optimum nutrition is the best dissolving and tasting protein supplement you can get per price . 
if you re happy with it because you think it s pretty ,  then that s great . 
nice graphics ,  a few exciting moments ,  and kinda cute . 
nothing like seeing $ bite the dust just because of some broken thin plastic parts . 
get yourself your favorite cup of coffee and a bottle of antacid instead . 
it s just not what it says it is ,  and it s not worth what they re asking for it . 
i do know it woke up a sleeping cat but nothing other than that . 
so i bought some for my kitties ,  opened the pack and bam it looks like soup . 
is it the  natural  angle they were going for here ?  i m not sure . 
but this brand is everywhere so it would be really easy to find again . 
we rolled it on a hardwood floor and it was not very fun for the dog . 
nothing is was wrong with the phone as it paired easily with other bluetooth devices . 
the batteries that i bought from your company are the same as the batteries that came with that phone . 
perfect for younger males and the little rampaging boy at heart . me ?  i m waiting for jaws . 
besides the fact these smell awful ,  my cat doesn t want anything to do with them . 
these are not worth a dollar .  .  . they are horrible quality and do not stay up on your thighs . 
customer service is basically  if you have to ask ,  you should not buy this  . 
when i formatted it ,  it stuck halfway and said . 
we ll probably throw it out after the winter . 
it s just .  .  . well ,  i finished the bowl ,  but i sure wasn t impressed at all . 
i have tried and have yet to find it . 
they look l like they would work great ,  but they don t . 
but all cats are naturally driven by fast moving things ,  they are hunters . 
more often than not ,  i can t even hit the enemy because the action occurs so quickly . 
it is hard to describe the tast of this soup . 
by num_num to present day ,  it has become a problem . 
i got this because i wanted to be able to switch between my computer speakers and my headphones . 
this one arrived in a sealed navy cardboard gift box . 
when i first reviewed these about num_extend ago ,  i thought they were an amazing little set of speakers . 
the game takes about num_num hours to finish . 
maybe all soft vibrators smell this way but i don t like it . 
there were four pieces that had to go into one of the four clock faces . 
i don t know what kind of crack reviewers are smoking ,  but this game sucks big time . 
in all ,  nothing effective is done by this clean and clear unit . 
i already have thick hair but am always looking for more volume . 
the product picture is clearly deceptive ,  leading you to believe the box would be full to the top . 
i ll return these for two more and see how the replacements perform . 
the fact that it was rechargeable was a real boon as well . 
within a few hours ,  the smell of deodorant turned into a rather nasty odor . 
it seems to only remove a couple of hairs per strip . 
i ve liked all of the haba items we have purchased other than this so it was disappointing . 
at first i was very excited about the duracel mygrid starter kit . 
not the same !  they are definitly not worth $
part of halo s charm for me and many others was the fact that it wasn t unreal or quake . 
not at all what you would expect from an l series . 
the taste is good and somewhat true to miso . 
even when tuned ,  the sound is not good because the body too is cheaply constructed . 
this however is only marginally better than gnawing pencil erasers . 
this one has a bare zipper on the top corners . 
my new socks are injinji also ,  but are of a different design . 
i gave the unit to a friend and it works perfectly on his sytem using the analog connection . 
i do not have gigantic ears ,  but the fit was not even close . 
i managed to break off num_num snaps ,  rendering num_num of the supports useless . 
i ll stick to water when i want to quench my thirst !  . 
like the other reviewer said ,  the cutscenes are terrible ,  i couldn t beliave my eyes . 
it doesn t really cure at all .  .  .  . i have the led lamp from sensationail . 
i also don t believe that it was protective to my hair at all . 
i ordered this brand only because it stated that it was in a jar . 
either one would be much better choices for preschoolers than this one . 
i hate the fact that every new game only brings a couple new options . 
the name of the game is intriguing and draws you in as a curiosity . 
the keep the current in your tank even and eliminate cold and hot spots . 
the master volume was at num_num and no effects were turned on . 
it takes all i can do to eat num_num of these ,  no wonder they were cheap . 
i had to affix it with super glue . 
after only two months ,  we ve decided to toss it . 
i am still awaiting the arrival of this product . 
after trying this product ,  i agree with other reviews that it doesn t last num_num days . 
these sheets are a great value but in this case ,  you get what you pay for . 
i tried to send an email ,  however ,  i am not sure i will receive a response . 
i like the idea but the execution is terrible . 
this will quickly end up on the shelf and not played with . 
putting them on i can see then pulling thin at every seam already . 
perhaps it s because it s organic ,  although i don t know that for sure . 
i didn t find that it had any flavor at all and was extremely disappointed . 
 code num_extend on any machine it s plugged into . 
you also have to hit the question mark for it to ask them to identify letters . 
this actually makes for decent viewing and function in landscape mode . 
the light seems crazy large for just two aa batteries . 
a lot of other reviewers mention that it makes your breasts cone shaped ,  and it certainly does . 
for one ,  it is too thick and wide to fit some of my pants . 
it gives full coverage ,  evens out your skin and just makes it look smooth and flawless and wonderful . 
the only positive thing i can say about this scale is it weighs in num_extend of pounds . 
the usb cord has too much wiggle and not a great fit . 
they cram many ,  many features into a tiny package . 
i thought it might be a miracle flour .  .  . but it s not . 
the  more sanitary  claim of plastic greatly goes downhill once it s knife scarred . 
they do work for bicycles ,  so ill keep it around for that . 
these green ones have been giving me a lot of trouble . 
then it broke in half while he was chopping a small branch held in his hand . 
i couldnt keep playing this game ,  i would rather die ,  seriously . 
money terribly wasted !  !  !  !  i really want my money back !   !  !  !  . 
if it is to tight and does not have enough slack it will tangle . 
if you add cream and sugar you cannot taste the coffee . 
i love the size of this unit and the way it operates ,  but it does not filter the water . 
the graphics suck and games are not all about the graphics but num_extend looks better . 
i have added the list of ingredients at the end of this review . 
it seems that the pet stores around me only carry this brand and i think one other . 
i have a very simple system so the problem is not in the configuration . 
i ve eaten dog ,  live crustaceans ,  insects and still cant find words to describe how bad this stuff is . 
i still use it to hold the sponge but ,  it just sits in the bottom of the sink . 
truth is it was slghtly faster then snes but couldn t handle the colors . 
i contacted mynetdeals and the very same day they sent me another one . 
turns out over % of all they sold where returned ,  the rest  ,  are for xmas . 
i ll use them until they fall apart which probably won t be too many weeks . 
my sponge cracked after several uses ,  not too happy at all . 
it is another puzzle game like tetris but not as fun . 
no matter how weak they are ,  they will dominate this guy . avoid this . 
that being said ,  i still can t recommend it to anyone . 
my favorite was my num_num cup kitchenaid that i gave away when we bought a vitamix . 
plus they weren t as thin as i d hoped ,  so i ended up going back to my lbs plastic set . 
my primary access is a dell precision num_num workstation using this controller . 
i was surprised that sony of all names has this poor product . 
got this for our tiny puppy and he just doesn t really care enough to chew on it . 
it did work a tiny bit but nothing like the claims . beware the scent . 
my usually black wax cups come apart super easy . 
i think they changed the formula in some way . 
this was a real disappointment for an oxo product . 
i will stick to a chef s knife for carrots for now . 
also ,  the parchment paper looks much cheaper than it use to . 
the chips have palm oil ,  containing a lot of saturated fat . 
we got this vanilla coffee hoping it would be a good coffee . 
if you like a weapon a lot ,  you can just keep using it to make it more effective . 
it is very strong and it lingers if left as is . 
i recently got this game for my son as a birthday gift and was really disappointed . 
i used it faithfully for three months and noticed no difference . 
it also removes stains completely ,  even ones that are dried and set in . 
the control system is okay ,  but the sound effect quite annoying . 
my suggestion is just wait until the price falls as it already has by $ i see . 
my num_num year old got this for his birthday . 
the graphics are not that great ,  and i hate the controls . 
the graphics are better ,  but not by that much . 
maybe its because i m too use to classics . 
this case is a great little case for netbooks . 
out of the box ,  it looks black when you apply it to your hand . 
she said it was too tight and that it became uncomfortable after a while . 
after reading reviews carefully ,  i decided to purchase this item . 
to be fair to the seller ,  delivery was fast ,  on time ,  and my refund was timely . 
but because of problems with the listing or at least some sellers ,  i don t think i can do that . 
i bought this for my chubby cat ,  hoping it would slow down him bolting his food . 
the only thing worse than the style on this bra is the way it feels . 
i grabbed the collar with two hands on opposite sides and pulled apart hard ,  expecting the collar to breakaway . 
i think my wife used this perhaps a dozen times before it died completely . 
at a retail store ,  you will pay about $ per tablet . 
there is no clock for different locations you can put on your home num_extend no world weather . 
yeah ,  i m way over this product and will never waste my money again . 
the included wrist pad wasn t any help either . 
i suspect it s the alcohol content since she has never objected to having her teeth brushed with other products . 
no wonder it came with num_extend i ended finally getting one good on the num_extend one . 
great sound and even a cool little spool for shortening the line . 
perhaps a notch up from bad diner coffee . 
the first plot twist will occur at the end of the second disc . 
it s one of those things that suck but you don t want to send it back . 
i don t mind the reflls but i do mind it not cleaning my mouth . 
there is a white enclosure to manage the dispensing of food . 
when it gets clogged the whole vacuum overheats and powers off . 
unfortunately i cannot endorse this product ,  not even a little bit . 
other than that the blue slide was constantly being taken off by my son . 
they actually sounded scratchy and distorted even on low volume . 
i brought it back to the store and they opened several different bottles for me ,  but they all stunk . 
i was so excited when i finally made my little spaceship . 
i will certainly buy this again for another iphone . 
i think it smells nice . my problem with the product is that it left my hair feeling sticky . 
there are no moving parts with this system . 
this game is so unrealistic that it is boring . 
improve the suction cup and you have a great item . 
this product should be removed from the market . 
this product looks nice but will die after a couple of months even if you do nothing to it . 
the test strips do not even change color !  !  i am a health food nut . 
to our amazement neither of us could open it without tearing apart the entire box . 
they look so unappetizing that i did not want to eat them and therefore didn t . 
the dosage is so light i can t imagine it working for anyone . 
radio shack built a couple of version some num_num to num_num years ago and they were excellent . 
in order to advance out of this stage you must eat your way to evolutionary development . 
i m not exactly sure why i tried something else anyway . 
they feel like polyester and they are not soft . 
i guess it s defective so we re sending it back and will find another one . 
the giggle belly dvd is also a hit . 
the rest fo the tiem it was in a drawer !  . 
even theweiman stainless steel wipeswork better then this product . 
the first thing i had to do was go find a bin to put everything num_extend
if one pair can start falling apart that easily ,  i don t expect these to hold up . 
the product itself did not work properly out of the box . 
if mixed weak ,  tastes like watered down coolaid . 
i only gope is that it last longer . 
used this for several days and it clearly doesn t work . 
even when centered over the apple ,  i still had bits of core and seeds on some of my slices . 
it s a severe design error that should never happen . basically ,  i think these designed for women ,  and sized for men . 
even with weekly cleaning there was some biological return . 
would repeated applications be beneficial ?  in two words :  hell no . 
chemically the nutrients are all there ,  but it s just not good quality nutrients and contains a lot of filler . 
i have natural num_extend textured hair and this cleansing cream did absolutely nothing for me . 
could have ordered a really tasty xl pizza from speedys for that wasted $
with the schiuma ,  you can pull the wand out and toss it in the dishwasher . 
and it s a tiny can for nearly a dollar !  sorry ,  it s not worth it . 
slap my wrist for buying this game new . 
the cups hold the egg securely ,  it s not likely to fall out even with a child handling it . 
the game isn t worthless ,  just not on par with gamewright s usual flair ,  and definitely developmentally geared toward younger children . 
i m now just waiting for code veronica for the num_extend while playing something else . 
this was nauseatingly bad ,  way too fishy and the red pepper base totally overwhelms the chili lime flavor . 
it got to the point that even the tech had to come over and check the system . 
this was so not worth the money ,  or the space it takes up . 
i like the tripod num_extend but the head is not very impressive . 
kb gear has gone out of business !  !  does not work with xp and never will . 
i could shave in half the time than before . 
it had an almost licorice taste to it that overpowered everything else . 
they will not eat any of the shredded  gourmet  type . 
my wife had a pedometer that requires odd these batteries . 
this brush didn t even have a chance to get that old . 
this toy is really small and just boring  .  .  .  . my grandson never even glances at it . 
so i went through various different types of foods . 
the other problem is that the levels are simply big to the point of being mind numbing . 
now i don t know what has been done to the formula but it now smells horrible . 
i regard valve and sierra as thieves and criminals . 
slides around a lot more in the car . 
it covers over my shoulder and gives me a full range of motion at my arms . 
he was very vocal and ticked off that transformers wasn t coming to bluray . 
at first i was very pleased with it ,  but three months down the road i am very disappointed . 
it s like my iphone ,  can t see the screen in sunlight . 
all i can say now is that you get what you pay for it . 
i never was so disappointed in my life . 
customer service is horrible ,  dishonest and more interested in shielding itself than actual support and customer  confidence  reconciliation . 
there are some confusing reviews for this product that made me curious enough to buy it . 
this is a cheap piece you can buy in any supermarket . 
the thought of having a portable entertainment system for hotels was intriguing . 
granted yes what you got on the playstation version rather than the num_extend version was better . 
i can t even eject the dvd to send it back to netflix . 
called the company and they were going to call me back . 
there were literally burned into the meat while the inside of the burger was rare . 
but on my cheeks especially it was pretty painful . 
my daughter love love love the toy story movies . 
this charger just feels a little too light like there s no battery juice . 
i bought both the black and the brown and can t wear either . 
filler in place of what could have been substance for an actual game . 
this morning my pot of coffee never made it . 
at first i was worried about the drm issues prior to release . 
within a day of getting it one fork slid right off and got lost . 
don t have much to say ,  bad game play and no easy setting . 
i like neutral scents because of my sensitive nose to fragrance . 
the container is way too small and sides all over need to be much higher . 
it has a hard and i mean hard rubber ear piece . 
ps :  we did email the seller to advise of the missing cap and wrong gallon water tank . 
unfortunately ,  the color is so dull that i didn t like the way they looked on me . 
the whole thing is no longer than the size of my hand . 
they responded quickly and said it was num_extend iu in the jar . 
plus the build quality just feels sturdier with the num_num unlike the jabra cruiser which feels cheap . 
a lot of the other reviewers have focused on the technical aspect on this dvd player . 
this was true of both the spf moisturizer and the night cream . 
it s just a cheap ballpoint and i can not figure out how to change the ink cartridge . 
however ,  there is not one piece that correctly goes into place . 
how in the name of zeus did this game get a num_extend i honestly do not see it . 
it has a slight beneficial effect on my cats ,  but not enough to justify continuing to buy these . 
i took it out; the sheet was bubbled up in some place . 
i can send it back at my expense and get a  partial refund  . 
anyway ,  in short ,  this is a weird looking hulk ,  nothing how the hulk should look . 
my leaf eater should be renamed string eater . 
i will not be buying from this company again . 
the cheapest rice cooker bought in a chinese shop performed better than this . 
i had very large pimples form from using it . 
i would have just ordered a new remote but for almost $ i think not . 
it mixes very poorly ,  does not fill you up and is way too salty . 
i bought this as a substitute to bottled water ,  however i wasn t that thrilled with it . 
i read all the reviews about this curling iron and it seemed like a great one to purchase . 
these tools were so bad ,  and cheaply made ,  there was no way i would even attempt to use . 
i concur % with the other negative reviews . 
it is different from son s  his castle is one piece  . 
i had to switch to another side that had two round pegs out at the corners . 
it seems there is a wide range of remarks concerning quality and weight . 
you can buy these at just about any dollar general store . 
the cost of a new hose is $
first off ,  let me say that this is a pretty solid keyboard . 
i may not know how to apply it properly ,  but this did not work for me . 
also ,  the pimples and surrounding skin seemed to swell up a bit . 
to some this is the best knife ever . 
although the battery operated models aren t much better ,  anything would be better than this . 
i use the heating pad method ,  always ensure i don t disturb the milk after incorporating the culture ,  etc . 
it is hard as a rock and almost impossible to use for anything that has to be measured . 
the vpn functionality is not so good and do not contact linksys customer support . 
i called the kershaw company but they were closed for the evening . 
without even thinking or looking at the device itself . 
on a positive note ,  it was very simple to install . 
it had a low sound and reminded me of the sirens some cities use as am emergency alert signal . 
the protector made my screen really dull and had an orange peel feel which i do not like . 
this phone case only came with the back ,  no front included . 
i tried applying it different ways ,  but it never looks good . 
but i ve been too lazy to mix em together and use em . 
based on that ,  i can t really recommend this which is strange given some of the reviews . 
even with all the healthy goodness i couldn t force myself to finish the bar . 
until it was broken just over num_num week later . 
i tried installing num_extend for num_num hours before i finally gave up . 
the black color from the sponge bleed onto my hands . 
as you play the early game ,  you collect rat meat and bones . 
they also didn t help me with my morning sickness either . 
initially i was impressed ,  and i really wanted to like these ,  but that s about it for the good stuff . 
i love to cook rice and figured it would be more economical to get a large bag . 
i ve only been using the travel press for three weeks ,  and i would hardly call usage very vigorous . 
perhaps use this detergent at the end of the season . 
i demolished the packaging trying to get the file out so there is no hope of a return . 
if i want whole food juice i ll use my blendtec num_extend
my num_extend has been out of service for over num_num months . 
the nozzle is enormous and is next to impossible to get on to the tire valve . 
dog is uninterested in toy ,  even when stuffed with his favorite goodies . 
you shouldn t have to open something and inspect it before giving as a gift when it is purchased new . 
i decided to learn how to get good at it ,  thus ,  leading to enjoyment of the game . 
now ,  unfortunately ,  my husband feels that he has to go shopping for a present for me !  . 
if it had fit i would have no other complainants . 
my only complaint is it was missing the slotted spoon . 
when they came they were the same waist size as the previous pair but longer . 
the ear bud broke off shortly after i started using these . 
this ruined num_num pairs of my girls pants ,  lucky they had no shirts on . 
the belly is intact ,  but once the neck ,  arms ,  and legs start to unravel ,  the stuffing falls out . 
after several hours of game play ,  i can safely say that this game is a total catastrophe . 
i ve owned other microfiber and rubber tip stylus pens ,  so this isn t my first experience . 
also not much fun to hit the ball ,  since it can only wind a few times around the pole . 
unless you just have to play every game with the potter name on it ,  avoid this one . 
i m currently experimenting with adding a blanket or something soft over it to help . 
it s worked for me in the past ,  but not this time . 
however ,  as typical of the pyrex brand ,  the pour spout is a lousy shape . 
then ,  yesterday ,  the unit would only play the first song in any playlist and then stop . 
i think that we got winxp to notice it . 
just seems like everyone is raving about how healthy these are . 
maybe if i remove the patches i can get it to work . 
i d probably just avoid this thing ,  unless someone can actually make one that works . 
this was barely drinkable hot ,  and given the taste it would have felt better if it were caffinated . 
if you have a chewer type dog i really don t recommend this !  . 
ummm .  .  . it is metal so this should not happen . 
reading a lot of other peoples complaints ,  it seems like this happens way to often . 
but in absolute honesty ,  no change to date after three weeks of nightly applications . 
the blood orange scent smells more like the chewable baby aspirin we had when i was a kid . 
and it will leave your hair weighed down . 
i don t have the package to send it back . 
my mother had a kitchenaid accolade that i absolutely loved . 
do yourself a favor and invest in the book cooking for isaiah  found on amazon  . 
bought these for a very high strung dog . 
and after a while ,  it doesn t even matter that the bomb is decorated with beloved characters and bright colors . 
a cable modem is a fairly uninteresting beast . 
he didn t pay it a second thought all night . 
 i would never expect something used as spermicide to be in an intimate wash !  !   . 
okay first of all i used this product for num_num weeks . 
the center conductor will transmit audio and the signal will get through . 
this machine does not pick up the dog hair ,  or grass pieces that come in on his feet . 
my grand daughter likes to share with everyone . 
these things will obliterate the first time a tire even comes in contact . 
the first lasted many years of diving and hard wear . 
i was worried i d damage my phone by forcing it into the attachment . i ended up getting a different device . 
my nails are thin from too much exposure to water and possibly lacking some important nutrients in my diet . 
worst of all there s a nintendo seal of quality on the box . 
nice ,  very heavy mug but cover does not fit . 
maybe for the puzzle twitch junkie this will get their buzz on . 
probably too much power for my num_num gallon tank . 
i then washed both front wheels with the same cleaning product . 
they where ok but none really stand out . 
the so called tricorder is imposible to use . 
i ve used this salt before though and it didn t seem to make any difference in the tank . 
how dumb is that !  ! the control panels are clunky . 
the only work they did was make it into a japanese setting and creating new dialog for the story . 
this product could be better for the price that it holds . 
needless to say ,  these are the reasons that i deem this toy unsafe . 
it is impossible to go bankrupt to my knoledge . 
perplexed school officials often called my frustrated parents to come ,  again ,  pick me up from school with  the punies  . 
doesn t seem to protect my phone at all at the time . 
it just wouldn t move on its own ,  the entire package is so shoddy and second rate . 
even an arcade game would have better graphics . 
it has relieved her more than this ever did . 
save up and buy the phiaton ps num_extend
the charger only lasted a week ad after that it just stopped charging my samsung galaxy num_extend
the cables seem to be a copy of your cable ,  but obviously are not very the same . 
this cc has some nice features for the price  backlight ,  temperature  but is has some unaccepable flaws . 
i don t understand why so many positive reviews on this product . 
quality of audio and video was excellent . the only other major complaint is the remote . 
unfortunately ,  this is not something over which canon has any control . 
definately not worth the money or the time . 
i ve moved it to different locations but still no luck . 
naturally i would never buy an oneida product again . 
you have to press very hard to get any sort of response and even then ,  it doesn t always work . 
worked well for abour a year and quit . 
setup was extremely easy ,  but connection speed from num_num feet was so bad my connection kept timing out . 
she s only a year so not that big yet . 
this product really did not work for me . 
the gas ,  the diarreah ,  the pain ,  it s all true . 
disappointed and would not recommend you buy these . 
while this is a terrific game concept with some nice features ,  it is far more work than play . 
not sure if i will ever use it cause i have no idea who to use it on . 
some times powering down all devices pain  and unplugging the power to the kvm will fix it ,  but not always . 
it all comes down to a matter of truth in advertising . 
for a few briefs seconds it tastes like those pastel mints my grandmother used to have num_extend
the toys r us brand doll is cuter and about the same price . 
this holder lasted about a week and then disintegrated . 
i bought two of these for our two dogs . 
i played the num_extend version first on the wii . 
the build quality and design is horrible compared to the solid feeling ipod . 
they promptly refunded my full purchase total plus the return shipping costs . 
charlie  aged num_extend liked the sauce but wouldn t touch the solids . 
the redeeming feature is that they provide very few of the awful noodles . 
the easiest option was to use the s key for a safe shot . 
after that my ears are in real pain and i have to take the headphones out . 
the crock and the lid go in the dishwasher . 
on the cement ,  you might need a new screen . 
also you can t adjust the angle of it . 
hoped i would get more use out of these for what i paid . 
but believe me ,  real maple syrup  and that is what they use  is too sweet . 
i have a lot of pyrex in my kitchen ,  but this one had to go back . 
you can make this battery at home with pennies  literally  . 
i will not finish the bottles ,  since it was such a negative experience . 
well ,  these are too salty for me ,  ,  ,  ,  , i can t eat them . 
the blades are sharp enough but the spacers fall out pretty easy . 
sent them back and was refunded by amazon . 
i bought this for my daughter for christmas after seeing this on tv . 
i was not all that impressed . let s start with taste . 
more than that ,  it s a small handpump so it s fairly weak . 
this is supposed to be a little bling thing but it has exactly the opposite effect . 
i installed them in my grand prix and saw no improvement ,  just a dent in my wallet . 
now the motor is dead and there is no warranty support . 
and i noticed my bangs were awfully dark . 
felt like i was doing more than just pressing garlic . 
i eventually emailed the company to see why they changed the box design . 
i am trying so hard to find something natural . 
so i just bought a local brand acne cream which has % benzoyl peroxide . 
don t own the regular uggs to try them . 
she and her twin brother play more with the horses terry cloth towel more than the horse . 
please ,  rent this first if you re still curious . 
that s $ wasted ,  and as a result there won t be any future butler creek purchases . 
the game play is a mix between a fps and a rpg . 
most sugarless gums make me sick ,  as i can t handle sorbitol and maltitol well . 
if dogs ingest too much of this it could be poisonous . 
my significant other did not like the way this feels at all . 
bought this because it was cheap ,  you do get what you pay for . 
it fits very snug and looks good . my issue is the same as some others . 
i bought this thinking it will work with my num_num vw golf . 
so i ignored the reviews and purchased anyway . 
even at full power this thing leaves a lot to be desired . 
that means that on num_num levels you cannot lose a life . 
i got an antibiotic presciption and paid a big bill . 
see the image above . i contacted phonesuite customer service . 
we are not allowed to return or give away vine merchandise ,  so what was this offer good for ?  . 
i can load books anywhere with my ipod touch . 
all tool are excellent as expected but beware that this is very small knife . 
we tried a small area on our dog and he had a severe reaction to it . 
the first day i had it ,  when i got home from work ,  i noticed that the cap was missing . 
i have since switched to the thicker bags offered by sunbeam trashrac . 
num_num stars because it is gta sa ,  it arrived ,  and it does work . 
i do have a problem with people calling this a video game . 
save your money !  this is not a  travel size system  !  . 
i don t think the product is worth the money at all . 
i ended up using this as a body sponge so as not to waste my purchase . 
some people are fortunate and got a machine that worked i guess . 
things  like eggs and hamburgers  stick to this finish . 
moving to two other windows xp pcs ,  the same was true . 
the way the shoe is constructed also put my feet in an awkward alignment ,  causing leg discomfort . 
i ve bought some cheap chinese crap before but this one was bad . 
these have a lot more treble and sound tinny to me . 
these are certainly short for a medium ,  although the rest of the fit is terrific . 
when i applied it on my iphone ,  there was no pink . 
however ,  i ve used better juicers . its num_extend the reamer is hollow and has large triangular cuttouts instead of ribs . 
don t bother ,  go out to your local retro store and pick up an actual ,  old snes controller . 
so ,  after using my cordless shark hand held for about num_num months ,  i m giving it num_num stars . 
worst of all the rubber is very cheap ,  and tears very easily . 
this snake is loose in the bore and will not clean . 
it had a vague chocolately espresso taste ,  but wasn t good . 
perhaps it s just mine ,  but it takes a good amount of pressure to unsnap the snapped pocket . 
all of which typifies what a huge disappointment the num_extend version of  sled storm  is . 
it has no  stickiness  needed to make it transfer from the brush to your lashes . 
i usually grind my own beans right before brewing . 
i have to take my water bottle cage off to even put the top clamp on . 
my recommendation is if you have very ,  very dry skin this can be a plus . 
i was hoping this product would reduce the aggression ,  but my hopes were sadly dashed . 
i am throwing this junk out and buying num_num of the num_num dollar can openers . 
mac does not sell our products on amazon ,  nor do we allow others to sell our products . 
i ordered this for my son and it did not last a month before started to come apart . 
one fit well but the other was longer . 
now ,  i m so bored with it that i m quitting . 
this does not have much ability to do anything . 
i used it when my hair was dry . 
this crayola crayon maker did not work at all for us . 
i have contacted cuisinart about it ,  but have not gotten a response . 
it s just in my hands instead of my wrists ,  and my hands hurt ! these can be disassembled for travel . 
on my lips they all apply the same color; hot pink or fuschia . 
i can t even determine why or what would cause this to happen ,  but it is a shame . 
nice ,  dark wood and looks very sturdy when assembled correctly . 
i then unplugged it again and it actually ended up shorting and i almost electrocuted myself . 
the plotline is .  .  . ok ,  i won t start on the plot . 
ecws sleeping bag system for a better design . 
i didn t buy this to stir in coffee ,  i bought it for cooking and hopefully for whipping . 
save your money ladies get something that works . 
made my hair feel brittle and dry and noticed nothing different . 
i assumed it was plastuc or metal that could be wiped off . 
if you want a good racing game expeirience get num_extend or num_extend season instead of this game . 
cheaply made and only a third the size of one he had from petco . 
they are interesting in theory and idea ,  but in practice they re a bit disappointing . 
used with msm and chondroiten with no effect .  .  .  .  . for me . 
i should note that this is my second dock . 
the base provides stability and an extra barrier for water protection when using the bag in the rain . 
please read the negative comments ,  they are all true . 
may work for some ,  but don t think this is a miracle for all dogs . 
my vet said to stop feeding it to him ,  so i switched him to oxbow ,  and the problem stopped . 
it sounds like someone is throwing things on the floor !  . 
i had to turn around from my trip and find a better container to transport him in . 
wind bothers him ,  rain hitting the window ,  fireworks ,  thunder and lightning . 
there are two small cracks emanating from the center of the bowl . 
both come in a package that is a good size to take along . 
there was no option to even choose a color only one was being sent . 
the fake leather on the ends are unbelievably cheap . 
i ordere this in the pink color and was quite disappointed . 
i changed the frequency to numerous ones and i kept hearing static . 
my throat has been tight . this is beyond an  allergic reaction  . 
i bought this camera for a friend of mine about to have a baby . 
i then decided to look in troubleshooting and found the answer to my problem . 
i was very disappointed with the fit of these headphones . 
i was hoping the shirt would get smaller as i washed it ,  but that has not happened yet . 
on a plus side ,  the orange plastic is easy to spot to clean up . 
the manufacturing process for this product must be totally devoid of any qa . 
this was not an issue that was encountered . 
amazon has the best prices generally and saves a trip to the store . 
this is possibly the worst piece of garbage put on the market . 
excellent brand but organic is always better for the planet earth and its inhabitants if organic available . 
research the harm this can do ,  for yourself ,  before using such a lotion . 
and i still could not zip it over my calf . 
too much read about this holster to trust it s quality . 
hers has metal cups the same diameter as an english muffin . 
ordered a new one ,  it arrived intact ,  and i installed it . 
its a good idea and design ,  but made with cheap materials . 
going by many of the reviews ,  i decided to give this lavaza crema coffee a try . 
just overall a bad experience and i will not buy again online . 
this thing looked great in the picture but what a strange way for it to work . 
exposed so i could fix my mask or snorkle etc . 
i think that for piloxing the open toed socks would be better . 
i dislike this radio because it was malfunctioning when i purchased it . 
it is quieter than previous filters of this style . 
the tea smells wonderful in a bag ,  but somewhat its aroma went away once it brewed . 
this k cup is not one of my favorites . 
i say bump because she no longer plays with it . 
i grew up on nabisco products ,  this is so uncharacteristic  :   . 
in our opinion ,  probably not enough to worry mr . 
ironically ,  i m far happier with my much cheaper num_extend
i will try sharpening my traditional dandelion digger tip and continue using it . 
these are the only nice things i can say about it . 
i wish they could give you the option of colors to choose from !  . 
the thin fabric just does not help with that . 
i wouldn t buy this item again since it would most likely fail in a year or less . 
sadly ,  not an option with this flavor ,  so i won t be purchasing these again . 
as another reviewr said  the nail polish is clear with tiny glitter . 
recorded audio sounds fine . i would add that these are recommended in the nakamichi owner s manual . 
what a waste of time with an obsolete technology . 
there are a lot pills because % daily calcium will take up must of pills . 
but the label on the product itself did not have any wool content . 
 :   we ended up with a digital one from a local store that is very accurate . 
she likes it okay but doesn t play with it that often . 
the other two phones are with num_num bar num_extend and num_num bar h+ respectively . 
when i grew a beard ,  i bought this unit based on the reviews i read here at amazon . 
others may find it works ok for them but it didn t for me . 
i had to replace mu thermostat and water pump on my num_num jeep grand cherokee . 
sucks that i keep spending my money on products that don t work . 
there is no visible improvement or innovative new feature at all . 
as the illustration shows ,  it is a metal tube with two plastic windows . 
i had some of this recently at a friend s house . 
when i first heard about sim city num_num on the gba ,  i thought dang that should be pretty sweet . 
i might have received a defective item but i am hoping to exchange for another one . 
within a day one of the tracks came off and broke . 
plug it in ,  turns on ,  turns off ,  no charge . 
at $ usd and with the reputation maxpedition has ,  i expect way more functionality out of their gear . 
the raw arena is the only arena and there are no backstage areas . 
maybe that s a requirement for the unrefrigerated packaging to help preserve the salmon . 
next time i will go for the regular l oreal preference formula . 
ugh !  this was not a good experience for me or my cat . 
this base coat does absolutely nothing for my nails . it doesn t protect then from staining ,  or anything . 
like many other buyers ,  the factory coating on my pan simply will not come off . 
i did not give it for a gift as it needs a more substanial chain . 
i always bought tdk all my life and since imation is involved i no longer buy them . 
i had prostate surgery terp years ago that resulted in both ed and ejaculation problems that have gotten worse with age . 
after all ,  it is just a heating element . 
and i agree with the other reviews ,  this is to small . 
diamond fell out after about maybe a week ,  not even . 
they ate them without hesitation since they had enjoyed them in the past . 
maybe i just got one from a bad batch ,  but this product didn t work right out of the box . 
the top didn t sit on the box properly and the peg maze didn t move fluidly at all . 
i ve used plenty of supplements ,  including similar ones that supposedly increase nitric oxide levels . 
the enclosed paper work only includes an address .  .  . no phone number . 
the manual cd repair products do a far better job than this one . 
very difficult to take to change the battery . 
even in manual mode ,  getting a sharp focus was a real challenge at num_extend or num_extend
ughh  .  . l i tried getting a toy for my puppy to play with to dispense treats . 
i kept having to dilute it with crystal light .  .  .  .  . sip ,  gag ,  dilute ,  sip ,  still gagging ,  dilute . 
you must swing the thing over the water reservoir to put a filter into the brewing basket . 
this unit was a great addition until the probe went bad after only a few months . 
even ones that have half the amount then this one . 
he is able to answer his phone if he down stairs and the phone is upstairs . 
so ,  i am back to the cheap cord that hasn t failed ,  unlike this brand new bad cable . 
just kind of a light floral scent that definitely isn t overpowering . 
you re supposed to press down on the squirrel and when released ,  it will spin the  carousel  around . 
however ,  it ruined my screen protector and i had to purchase a new protector . 
be warned !  this carrier is only num_num x num_num x num_num inches on the inside . 
i used these because they claim a warranty . 
hard to use and didn t see any improvement in condition of the compressed clothes . 
i am using it for my reef tank . 
the part i received did not have the ribbed base ,  and it literally crumbled in a matter of weeks . 
i personally don t care whether my headset is laying flat on my counter or standing up . 
just use google and read pet food reviews . 
the clear plastic lid does triple duty as a lid ,  a measuring scoop ,  and butter melter . 
i put it in a juice with diluted water . 
on the stock battery ,  i would get about num_num hours of light to moderate use . 
a year went by and i got along by using a workstation . 
it does not seem very special ,  and it s far from memory foam . 
i understand that this product is to be used to alert you to moths in your home . 
even down to the label markings on the cable ,  it looks like adesso . 
it has a lot of features but really most of them are not functional . 
i read the reviews ,  some good and some bad . 
tries way too hard to rip off the dead to rights series . 
stick with creams ,  they seem to do the job much better . 
i am petite and bras always come up too high on the sides so they show with sleeveless tops . 
there is a reason why there is no postage added on .  .  . this piece of crap probably cost pennies to produce . 
i just don t know what to do anymore . 
not expensive so no big loss ,  but i would not buy again . 
out of the box it was inconsistent with how often it could pick up a heartbeat . 
only one of the rings has stayed shiny .  .  . the other two are grey and dull . 
the switch watermelon strawberry carbonated fruit juice was tasty ,  but was a little too sweet for my tastes . 
i had to throw away all of them . 
not the quality from sketchers that i m used to . 
just because it is mario does not make it any better . 
well when i was at my heaviest i could grab quite a bit ,  around my bellybutton and my sides . 
now i have a new phone so i m not so unhappy with it . 
yep ,  i was lucky not have green hair but this disaster ended my record . 
num_extend they are almost too small and are too wide . 
i would say don t leave it on as long as recommended . 
if you buy this toaster hoping to get lucky ,  you might  based on some people s reviews  . 
also ,  power supply doesn t output the correct voltage . 
so before opening try to find something to put the coffee in after you get the bag open . 
after looking at the amazon reviews i tried sharpening the blade with no luck . 
the num_num was taped on one end ,  as if it had previously been opened . 
but no matter how you describe it ,  it is undrinkable . 
my dog likes balls that she can get in her mouth or squeak . 
it was still in date ,  so i don t know . 
the second time wheni notice there was bad taste to the mix . 
i can honestly say i wasn t missing much . 
this game is boring ,  stupid ,  not fun ,  poor controls and the characters are not interesting . 
so quality is already shoddy ,  before even wearing it . 
based upon the reviews here i hoped the sound would have been at least consistently good . 
i find dog toys are hit and miss . 
its overpowering flavor required the hasty preparation of a sauce in order to make it palatable for my guests . 
we have purchased num_num of these and they just don t last . 
well ,  have been using it faithfully each day; and ,  no signs of improvement . 
i bought this lens about num_num years ago with my num_extend
we bought this ,  thinking that it would help our little shih tzu keep his own teeth clean . 
i recently got both versions of this device . 
it is only num_extend megapixels and costs about $
i bought a simple haveaheart trap and sent this back . 
this product costs almost twice as much as the others so i subtracted a star for that . 
also i thought that since it was a charging only cable it would charge faster . 
attempts to draw more current result in rapid voltage drop ,  at num_num ma the voltage is down to num_extend
after my dog discovered the  dot ,   she went crazy for it ,  which was a pleasant surprise . 
it is pure garbage and i ve ordered my last pair . 
it constantly begins charging the battery and stops after num_num seconds . 
problematic in the design of this coffee maker is the reusable filter setup . 
i would hesitate ever buying a cuisinart product agin ,  especially as a gift . 
he also has trouble putting these on himself and it takes me quite some time to help him . 
she s quiet but she s got a sharp attitude and a hot trigger finger . 
if you re a big re fan ,  rent it . 
and large !  i easily made a triple batch of muffins . 
of course amazon was great about the return and i purchased the plantronics voyager pro hd . 
but i wanted really good sound ,  and this doesn t have it . 
they arrived with other items ,  in a bigger package ,  and the package was not damaged . 
i could have exchanged for a whole size smaller and still be roomy . 
when it arrive it was in it s original shelf box with no packing material at all . 
it is a continuous stream at least ,  but is not worthy of having anything like  soaker  in the name . 
did i say it was slow ? one email contact to tech support containing four questions brought no response . 
i don t even want to think about what happened to the missing glass . 
banana s are cheaper than this stuff for sure . 
use a rock ,  rocks are at least american made !  !  . 
she got to play with it once before it broke . 
i bought it saturday night to play on fathers day ,  and i finished it before fathers day arrived . 
i was expecting the num_extend to be much better made than it appears to be . 
i m not impressed ,  and neither are my dogs . 
i returned them to amazon and ordered another pair of the dockers signature khaki num_extend
i suppose the benefits outweigh the flavor issue ,  but as for me i will find better tasting healthy products . 
you can see it eagerly sucking in little bits of debris . 
i am sorry but this did not work for me . 
they wake me up just as well as this did ,  or any coffee does . 
it is not easy to handle till you put the negatives in it . 
although it worked ,  sensor of phone  bottom left doesn t work well . 
a few months later another attempt was made which had the same results . 
when i picked the phone up ,  i could see the shattered screen . 
my son would get constantly frustrated with how the tracks fell apart . 
it seems to have been unnecessarily dumbed down in order to make it harder for the player ,  perhaps . 
the guy who modeled the ships did a great job but everything else is next to worthless . 
i have an old original droid and that fits like a glove . 
i work hard to avoid buying plastic products . 
num_num stars for performance ,  minus num_num for pooping out after less than num_num months . 
i wasn t looking for high end cutlery ,  just a cheap but well made set of knives . 
the deal breaker is the distorted plastic mirror . 
get the real samsung case and save yourself the headache . 
total cost of operating just the machine ,  about $ per hour over the lifetime . 
a few gameplay improvements were introduced ,  such as the ability to  influence  your companions . 
the adhesive it has makes anything that sticks to it permanent . 
i really wished i had a great experience like the other reviewers . 
i bought it from walmart and will be returning it tomorrow . 
i m not sure if axe changed their formula for this product . 
i remember this game being a lot of fun on the original xbox . what else . 
after that it functions about the same as the stock battery . 
i had to order this item twice since fedex lost the first one from another seller . 
so i am out the money and no way to contact anyone at all . 
it looks like a teenage girl color or play make up . 
i thought these would be great give her a little traction and keep her from licking . 
these company products used to be great !  i used the shampoo ,  conditioner ,  spray . it worked !  not the case anymore . 
i wanted a toy to help him learn to write letters . 
it was clearly made so that the latch lifts up and flips down ,  but can be removed easily . 
but it s not even as good as mario . 
i finally made it  disappear  and left them with the ball to play with . 
they cost about $ and will last you forever . 
i thought i had finally found my perfect sports bra . 
the container itself looks fine ,  i actually think it would house frogs quite nicely . 
i like more defined bass that gives rock and alternative music a punch . 
its goofy ,  unintuitive and bound to quickly lose the attention of most kids . 
well on the second occassion i got twice as far . 
there are only ten of them in  road rage  and they are too quickly beaten . 
very disappointing after reading so many great reviews on it . 
and it is in a heavy duty metal shell . 
i proceeded to wash it of my face and that was a disaster . 
there is a reason there was a class action lawsuit against skechers and they lost . 
sharp edges ,  rough interior ,  sharp spurs from the spot welds . 
i wish i could find another like it . 
gave it two stars for fast shipping and good packing ,  but the cologne itself . 
in sand ,  it digs four holes for each wheel and wont move . 
not !  i received teeny tiny package in it a teeny tiny reddish thing on cardboard . 
it will not stop me from using amazon . 
he could care less that there is food in it . 
this thing has opened less than num_num cans and it s shot . 
i got what i order the way they said would come . 
my plates came with all sorts of dings and pits . 
i tried it in both coffee and carbonated water ,  but yucky both ways . 
the light cover fell off the num_extend time i cleaned it . 
it flakes on my black brows and my eyebrows do not hold their shape after a few hours . 
i will never buy another palm product again . 
i would expect this from a walmart belt ,  but not a docker s belt . 
it would charge maybe % then stop charging . 
it was striking how easy it was to tell which was which by taste alone . 
i want to try again but they did not have the size i wanted . 
it is pretty noisy ,  about like a old cassette tape with no dolby . 
num_extend cost a lot more and i did not see any difference in my skin . 
well ,  to sum it up ,  it s extremely hard ,  to the point of frustrating . 
it is lighter than the otterbox original but it is still not light . 
it is true to size ,  but the lace is very itchy and irritating . 
the level progression system is definatively diablo inspired . 
the motor burned out the second time i used the blender . 
i tried to install that ,  but the microphone refused to work . 
update and final decision :  a big thumbs down . 
the idea that you get num_num swipes with a weapon before it breaks was lame . 
i ve owned many pairs of minnetonka moccasins ,  all of them size num_num and perfect . 
i think maybe it is because they replaced the rope with a rubber faux rope . 
another thing that made game play worse is the control of corruption which is ,  i later learned ,  basically inevitable . 
personally ,  i find this confusing and distracting while driving . 
i was looking for a product with no petrolatum . 
if this thing were made of better quality i would buy it in a heart beat . 
she still drags the thing around but has pulled many tufts of the fur off . 
this product isn t sweet like sugar at all . 
i would have given a better rating had it caps on the bottles . 
my house has bare floors and large num_extend wool or cotton rugs ,  and num_num cats . 
the large fry cutter screen bent and fell apart leaving me with only the small cutter . 
i recently purchased the bunn num_extend num_extend coffee brewer . 
i really wanted to like this bread slicer ,  since the price is so reasonable and it is attractive . 
your better off getting your child a real small toaster oven . 
plagued by small screens . palm num_extend the num_extend version of the num_extend
i got this item in a timely manner ,  no complaints about that . 
hard to complain too much as i paid only $ but i wouldn t recommend it . 
sadly this is my first negative review of any product i ve gotten from amazon . 
what is called a silver chrome is more a white with the slightest hint of gray . 
i m going to try and contact the manufacturer and get the parts bag . 
dimensions :  num_extend x num_extend but they both have the same issue . 
it states it has lemon to it; i could not taste lemon at all . 
if you do not want to lose your pet i wouldn t purchase this item !  . 
finally she gave me a totally false and nonsensical solution . 
the crystals around the face are not boxed in like the picture . 
i made a couple of grilled cheese sandwiches using plenty of butter . 
took me a while to figure out how to put my phone in it . 
very high level of noise three pixels on all the time . 
but the num_extend cartridges hold no where near as much space as the playstations black cds . 
no real plot twists ,  no real  oh man i didn t see that coming . 
the previous versions had all been improvements of prior versions of the game . 
although these num_num plastic pieces only cost less than $ they are not worth num_num cents . 
this is about as fake as it comes . 
it was a waste of money and i would not buy this again for another child . 
i m an rpg nut ,  but this one is just plain bad . 
it was inexpensive and the nicest i could afford at the time . 
it is very small in the crotch area and provides little support . 
sadly ,  i find the difficulty level in this game to be too high . 
this shoe is great for people who can wear the soft footbed birks . 
it doesn t let you play as robin ,  but it has more depth and . 
my shih tzu couldn t reach the bells unless he is standing on his hind legs . 
fit is okay ,  feels to startchy and stiff for me . 
will it suffice if you re looking for that truely great cutting board ?  no . 
i thought ,  after doing quite a bit of research ,  that this bag would suffice . 
this does work but wears off very quickly . 
i had to return as i could not tolerate this item . 
there are other cameras with more megapixels ,  faster response time ,  better battery life ,  lighter weight ,  better lens ,  etc . 
the cheesy aluminum bracket broke near the base . 
it s almost impossible to control jax , let alone fight . 
i wouldn t say that pedipaws was incredibly fast . 
i had previously bought the same thing for my iphone num_num and thought they were pretty good . 
but poor little hedgehog  who was cute as could be  was no match for  the brute  . 
i will not be buying this particular color again . 
so now i am back to using the razor blade for all my pill cutting . 
after about a week of using this my skin has really cleared up . 
for your own safety ,  insurance ,  and liability reasons you need the latest charts . 
in redemption ,  this was probably one of the best features . 
argan oil is fantastic for skin and hair ,  and it s one of my favorite products . 
in practice ,  however ,  it does little ,  and caused more problems for me than not using it . 
there are only num_extend taken from ffix ,  with some very nice enhanced graphics . 
i hate that i payed $ for a coffee pot that only worked for six months . 
i bought these thinking they would stay with me longer . 
it ll take longer to find those last few orbs than it will to find the first half of them . 
i keep having to open the machine to reposition things . 
after num_num weeks all i see is my scalp tingles and itches . 
the texture of this product is petroleum jelly . 
i don t find it enjoyable for that reason . 
i emailed evenflo with my thoughts on the chair and got no response . 
now a few months later i occasionally have had bleeding again ,  and a little bit of soreness . 
still ,  i have to base my review on my experience only . 
her neck is way to thin it should be more of a room decoration then a toy . 
as a feline behaviorist ,  i used to recommend the ssscat unit all the time . 
i bought this to help with bad breath ,  but it doesn t help . 
i bought this crib for my num_num year old daughter . 
i think you need to be a pro in order to make use of this little tool . 
a great idea; a method of storing filters within easy reach . 
i highly doubt this can be good for cats as our cats are not extremely fussy . 
i only used num_num trays to dry some apples . 
i have to tap the iphone screen several times so it will register the contact . 
the ingredients are good for you but with not nuch flavor . 
please ,  save your money and time and get another game . 
other than this flaw ,  i love the case . 
i use it with a very flexible ,  heavy duty extension cord in my basement . 
this item looks much like the picture presented ,  but the sizing is misleading . 
the pieces have some sort of a texture ,  the lion has some fuzz etc . 
bought this because of reviews i read on how generic foot pain went away . 
it is really noisy and kept even my deep sleeper husband awake . 
now that it is together i am using it . 
do a little research on this and its successor ,  the num_extend before you buy . 
i bought the shoe thinking they had excellent support . 
there are other excellent options and i am switching to another manufacturer . 
this increases the chances of leaving it plugged in . 
no goal ,  no plot ,  no story ,  no purpose . 
also ,  lg has horrible customer service . the first one i had didn t even last a year . 
got this for my cat but he did not like the taste of it . 
i hope the replacement holds up better than the originals did . 
they both drip horribly but one drips more than the other . 
i just wanted a hazelnut ,  and now i m having to get my screwdriver . 
given as a christmas gift to num_num month old ,  num_num lb ,  grandson . 
unfortunately the sensors are very sensitive and the machines stop working after a while . 
i m very disappointed about that . especially since this is supposed to be a healthy and environmentally conscious company . 
several months on ,  it s tracking poorly and the cursor skipping . 
the ticks don t die and still attach ,  but watch out . 
not sure what the problem was ,  but our butter went bad in this thing . 
i personally think otterbox failed with this one . 
this game is so hard it takes away any fun . 
 weakness being lack of good kids stuff just my two cents  : o  . 
and it does appear to be a genuine motorola product . 
also ,  i have some compact flash cards for my digital camera lying around . 
however i notice that my ankles started swelling tremendously and i started to become concern about this . 
of course it is over num_num days since i bought it and nonreturnable . 
below is my review from christmas num_num but here is another review after few months .  .  . march num_extend
i will continue ordering my favorite australian ginger in the future . 
i have been using them for over num_num months now and it has worked perfectly . 
after i used my last spare fuse i decided to purchase a new and different  usb charger from elsewhere . 
my love for this brand is the only reason i gave num_num stars . 
at this rate it is less effective than turning your food half way through the heating cycle . 
the seller s description deliberately omits this ingredient as it is listed clearly on the back of package . 
it does not look like it came from the manufacture . 
for the price it was a good value and beginners will enjoy it . 
pellegrino is ,  in my opinion ,  an excellent example of how nature provides trace minerals ,  the gold standard . 
i hadn t heard him whimper like that since he was a puppy . 
i hate square toes because they look masculine on me . 
the red looks more like a gold ,  and is dissapointing . 
very very disappointing and for the price not worth it to me to only have num_num different sizes . 
i was really disappointed because i can t really afford to spend anything more on a good straightener . 
just like stainless strings; harder metal against nickel frets is going to wear them out real quick . 
when i woke up ,  i synced it ,  and the app showed .  .  . nothing . 
the size was way too big ,  for a medium . 
i will not be buying this brand again . 
i m a chocolate lover ,  so this is rather disappointing . 
since it was an outside vendor i had to pay the shipping charges . 
altered them to fit ,  but the cat wouldn t leave them on . 
it holds an edge okay but the finish and quality is just not there with this knife . 
i have num_num boys so i know some thing about toys and quality . 
however ,  i advise anyone purchasing this case to avoid putting watches with light colored straps in it . 
i would warn dog owners that the squeaking mechanism could easily be a choking hazard . 
without exception ,  using a full charge to start ,  each unit would last about an hour . 
i couldn t even feel the blade the first couple of shaves . 
major pain !  !  !  !  !  i will end up donating this just to get rid of it . 
in the end the battery didn t last long and she would only clean bare floors and wide open spaces . 
wish i could return it but i didn t pay that much so let s just say its one lesson learned . 
it makes for a very unnatural ,  ugly complement to the french white tip . 
if you look at the reviews on orion s website ,  they are strongly positive . 
thank heaven i paid an amazon price !  !   other than the num_num product ,  i d recommend bali products . 
then i cleaned it with a mild vinegar solution . 
fourth ,  the pole should be at least num_extend longer . 
and it certainly wasn t worth relinquishing control of my system to that invasive steam app . 
some holes drilled off by as much as a half inch . 
she never played with this toy as a crawling infant . 
it is very drying so if you have extremely oily hair it might work for you . 
after about num_num minutes of play ,  my child was over it . 
overall ,  not a great toy ,  and one i don t really recommend unless you child just haaaaas to have it . 
four buttons for better game play  zire has only two num_extend
i am not going to bother fixing it . 
there are two zippers to each of the front pocket that go left and right of each pocket . 
no instructions came with it although it s pretty idiot proof . 
but you decide to try it again just to be safe and get a totally different reading . 
also because of the extended battery that i had originally had . 
i ordered the white ones and the bows are white ,  not red as shown . 
it takes about num_num mins of teasing the plastic around all edges . 
ill update on how easy that process goes . 
the white beans are kind of mushy and the broth has a kind of unnatural ,  industrial taste . 
this disconnect would last anywhere from num_num seconds to a minute or more . 
then again your back in pitch black ,  mean while your foe has hobbled off the side . 
my apologies for no in the field data ,  but i dont believe anyone else posted its origin . 
so the product itself is strong and does a great job at cleaning pet stains on the carpet . 
the color was so dark and they had a little flare to them . 
brought this home on sunday afternoon ,  threw it away on wed morning . 
i expected great things from the wii version of this game . 
i placed my money and my phone inside and it stayed dry . 
i only really experimented with it on indoor shots ,  but the reflections and ghosted light blurs are just ridiculous . 
i normally have a wonderful experience with amazon ,  but this bread box has become a headache for me . 
mine is set at num_num  my dog has very short hair  . 
so i will get rid of it and buy another brand . 
now if you enjoy it ,  hey enjoy it i just don t anymore . 
however ,  i do recommend it because of its high nutritional value . 
i bought this several years ago and i m replacing it because it just doesn t get the job done . 
i would be hanging num_num lbs of cookware in addition . 
definitely one of the worst tasting chocolate whey proteins out there . 
if you have a hard time swallowing pills then find an alternative . 
it makes it near impossible to use the bag singlehanded . 
but look at the shipping weight in the product details section :  num_num pounds . 
basically ,  you have to start at a difficult level and stumble your way through until your skills become polished . 
if i rub my thumb down he rubber side ,  small bits of rubber rub right off . 
the music sucks and the chatter gets old even faster than the game . 
loaded the game many times ,  many different settings ,  no luck . 
i wanted to make my num_extend last as long as possible as it is a great phone . 
i recommended it to a friend with a gigabyte mb ,  and it crashed the machine repeatedly . 
i don t think i would ever buy a phone from this manufacturer again . 
that should keep it cleaner ,  and make it last longer . 
so called natural supplements are sometimes not so natural after all . 
but it turned out to be the dvd player . 
forget it ,  this item is being returned to the place of purchase within num_num hours . 
i want to say first off that this is a pretty good game . 
the teams you go up against are superstars . 
though he also commented on it and thought it was some sort of yeast infection . 
most of the time we do it without anything but we thought what the heck . 
i m sorry but $ for this tiny little cat toy is just silly . 
this may not be the same for all cables . 
metal scrubs tend to rust for same reason . 
this seems like a bad idea if you like french press pot coffee . 
yes ,  i checked the battery and it was fully charged . 
i bought num_num of these and they are junk ,  they all fell apart . 
for the price the jawbone has to be the worst . 
i hope and pray that they don t make another wrestling game for the xbox . 
there is really no particular strategy for the first % of the game . 
downloads literally take num_num times as long as a true wired connection . 
and ,  of course ,  they can t be reused after you crimp them the first time . 
the jacket is very bulky and ,  to me ,  uncomfortable . 
i loved these speakers when i had them . 
it heated up quickly and stayed hot enough to straighten curls . 
i personally can t stand michelle branch or any of those whiny untalented american pop artists . 
this is also part of the reason why there are too many turnovers in the game . 
after we opened the package ,  my husband and i decided to throw them away immediately . 
when brewing starbucks natural fusions vanilla flavored coffee ,  i found the smell to be tantalizing and pleasantly inviting . 
changed batteries ,  hit reset several times .  .  . stuck in demo mode . 
you can switch to them and then enter any level you ve already completed once . 
even when it stays closed ,  the bra moves around inside ,  getting folded and causing the padding to get crushed . 
i ve known and happily used sandisk cf cards before ,  high quality ,  good price . 
the only good aspect of this product to me is that it mixes very easily . 
they did just that ,  cut up meat ,  bone ,  cardboard ,  plastic ,  just about everything for about a month . 
i got this in the mail yesterday ,  opened it and took some before supper . 
i did go to my dr once ,  however by the time he saw me it was almost gone . 
it was also much too small even though i ordered according to the size chart . 
that is why it doesn t show this review as an amazon verified purchase . 
for the price ,  i would expect it to work better than this . 
now i m back to the troubling task of charging the stupid thing up . 
it is about to become a curb ornament . 
i usually wear a size num_num in women s ,  but i have wide feet . 
if you buy one ,  it seems to be a crapshoot whether it will work or not . 
these levi s are not what they used to be . 
i bought this and boy was that a mistake on my part . 
it is rated to lift five pounds ,  but i don t trust it that much . 
i thought it had to be that my blood sugar meter was not working correctly . 
it does claim to have a lot of protein ,  i can t comment on the nutrition . 
i have two of them  by mistake  and use them in the budgies cage . 
the battles were too easy ,  and enemy selection is limited . 
the best thing about it is the tardis skin that i have put on it . 
i have used fresh and clean products for years . 
the first two mornings i discovered it i thought ,  well ,  maybe it is user error somehow . 
yesterday i was going to order this card but there was a wait list . 
this item comes up when you search for  large dog toy  . 
but ,  we re talking about resolution that was out num_num years ago . 
i debated to sew the costume myself but there were too many areas to mend . 
this shoe is not comfortable like running shoe , the sole is hard  ,  and flat  ,  and little heavy . 
i ve had many smart phones over the years and have used many screen protectors . 
i got this stuff because of all of the rave reviews . 
you try to jump ,  but the controls are so stiff and unpolished that you only go straight up . 
that s like sitting six inches from yout tv and using a num_extend
let me first start off by saying it doesn t ,  not one ounce ,  taste like espresso ,  coffee ,  or anything similar . 
but ,  i have to admit like the others have said ,  the game takes a long time to load . 
i ve used a speed v comp about num_num years ago and had no issues . 
i will never buy another motorola product again . 
i am a woman with medium width nails and i love the size of these clippers . 
you have enough courage to change your labels ,  but not the tarnished image . 
between num_extend and num_extend i thought i could get at least % extra time . 
i really liked the first two jak games ,  so i was excited to try jak num_extend
the main problem with the game is that it s very unresponsive . 
when i visited the xbox live website ,  i was informed that it will not work with aol broadband . 
he looks like he s sprinting but he doesn t move fast at all . 
my first one wouldnt even turn on ,  the replacement lasted a week . 
very cute top but you need to order it about num_num sizes bigger because of clingy material . 
it s off to the salvation army for this turkey . 
also the fact that you have to  buy  new characters is kind of disappointing . 
i will say that it does its job in protecting you from a sunburn . 
in our particular review copy ,  the parts were misaligned and it was impossible to stand up properly . 
it has a built in sony battery that you have to use its own specific charger for . 
that automatically draws a one star review from me . 
got it as a gift ,  and it was worthless . 
if you have sensitive skin or know you are sensitive to methylisothiazolinone ,  i would recommend avoiding this product . 
this was not a hit with my son ,  num_num years old . 
in all honesty ,  i m embarrassed to give them to him ,  they look so cheap . 
used it for num_num days and broke out like a teenager . 
you take only one tablet daily ,  so they could have made two smaller ones which wouldn t choke you . 
buy a crusher made of metal ,  this is a piece of plastic junk . 
the num_extend comes setup to get an ip address by dhcp . 
yes i keep it in freezer for num_num hours before using . 
i did fit these with nic out filter which helped ease the harshness  but not the smell  some . 
it might be instant response but it was rarely accurate . 
the two end cross beams slide on to a metal head post . 
but once in a while ,  this thing gets scary . 
instead of receiving the body solid num_extend mat ,  i received a cheaper version ,  the supermat from target . 
this was the third one i purchased as my other two just stopped working after num_num seasons . 
i returned my first unit because it arrived with a broken plastic tray top . 
you really need a low ,  narrow foot for these . 
i bought several bras recently to accommodate my growing body  i m num_num months pregnant  . 
i would never use this product for cooking or eating however i did find other  uses  for this stuff . 
i play a ton of dungeon stomp rpg s and this just didn t pan out . 
i was previously very interested in this camera . 
after two weeks this wouldn t hold a charge . 
so i spent $ for this food processor and rec d it in jan . 
so ,  first off ,  i m a big fan of otterbox products . 
the real thing is in olive oil and shouldn t be excessively salty . 
hoping to get the quality that comes with the bates name i got these . 
i bought this in may ,  num_extend for making bread . 
it s too bad ,  because it gives me energy and it has organic grasses . 
that surprised me because i have more hips than bust . 
ka only had one speed .  .  .  . on . this is good and sturdy ,  easy to clean ,  easy to store . 
i think it is meant for someone without hips . 
this is crap ,  move along ,  nothing to see here . 
they are now just sitting in my medicene cabinet because i couldn t swallow that many a day . 
my num_num year old son hurt himself when he tried to shovel because it fell apart . 
i should also mention that i love pina coladas too . 
just too ridiculously tiny to showcase the design . 
they do put it in the food as of the date of this review . forget this stuff !  . 
this way you could kill almost every one without losing any health . 
one of my cats refused to use the litter at all . 
it seems that now they are used to the trap sitting there ,  it is starting to be effective . 
but ash s girlfriend is kidnapped by bad ash  more like evil dead ii s then army of darkness   . 
the strips are very tiny and must be handled carefully ,  although they are not difficult to apply . 
this will definitely be my last time eating these items unless they improve the saltiness ,  grease ,  and toughness . 
the ramps screw into the plywood floors with short little screws . 
because the pieces are straight edged ,  the puzzle is never together ,  always in pieces . 
but it s only a deal if you buy enough for free shipping $ min purchase  . 
dynamat is an awsome product ,  and it does work . 
i have noticed that there are a lot of high reviews on this item . 
i have read this about the brand .  . amy brians ,  like all canned coco water this brand is  cooked  coconut water . 
after i finished the bottle of lilash i switched to this product . 
since sights are not adjustable this must be attributed to poor manufacturing . 
why bother ?  get one that has a stainless steel cap and skip right past this . 
the plastic front door is super flimsy ,  and looks like it would shatter on any serious impact . 
my normal cholestrol reading is num_extend too high ,  the doctor put me on lipitol . 
i think that this is a dangerous product . 
it played about about the same length of time that the generator was wound . 
the instructions did not mention that and it took us  husband and i  a while to figure that out . 
i had to dump it out and quit after the first taste . 
i am also a quite a fan of boff but i was very disappointed . 
this product itself is great ,  but is it worth waiting num_num days for ?  . 
could be coffee grown in new jersey for all one knows . 
i guess i shouldn t have expected much for $ but the audio quality on these headphones is really poor . 
and it s stored in the box to go to the salvation army . 
discount tire tried to sell me a deal to replace the old tpms and stem for $
it works but i was hoping for a higher quality feel . 
your only way to attack in this game is by using magical playing cards . 
you will still need a source of num_extend a regulator ,  and a hose . 
i plugged in num_num feliway diffuser to try to help with my cats  behavior . 
i then used a dremel to cutout the traced areas and i m sure improved cooling in the process . 
there is barely enough paint here for num_num paint session . 
it doesn t take long before a barrage of missle is aiming for your cars . 
yes i did the water under and over . 
i have better luck with my acne on my chin using oil tree foot balm on my face . 
they all smell fairly similar ,  flowery ,  sweet ,  but somewhat artificial . 
taste like dry cardboard !  even cheerios have a  taste .   my num_num month old loves puffs but spits these out . 
get the travel version which is closer to the original and costs way less . 
they were also stiff and difficult to sit down while wearing . 
it makes it longer and just a bit heavier . \the base and charging system itself works flawlessly . 
yes ,  kellogg s hit a home run with num_num gmos in these pop tarts . 
the enemies difficulties do not seem to change depending on where you are on the map either . 
i do not see why it needs to be num_num lbs . 
purchased a couple years ago and used twice  gently !   on pumpkin butter . 
instead i received a completely all black silicon case . 
one of the worst purchases i ve ever made . 
i think i will probably getting the itrip next . 
he never hears me and i feel like i have to yell . 
one would believe that i would love newman s own organic pomegranate licorice . 
its like a mix of fruit punch , and plastic .  .  .  .  .  . just not appealing . 
we bought this to replace our num_num year old can opener after the blade on it snapped . 
i bought it to take my music with me . 
i called the company back and they re sending out another new base . 
you may have to uninstall other keyboard software first . 
but i don t feel that it compliments fruit smoothies very well and makes smoothies taste much worse . 
unless your screen is extremely dirty dont even bother with this . 
with the production value ,  this could have been such an awesome game . 
my advice is to stick to professional salons or diy with brushes . 
i mean ,  check out the ironclads game that i reviewed . 
you also can t cut the cake without removing the birthday saying . 
the overall mechanics seem to be chopped up into a complete mess . 
it does not enhance any type of memory retention . 
jelly tastes a bit off and there i really no nutrition . 
it didn t stop the snoring nor make it less . 
visible streaking and blurring as objects move across the display are for kids toys ,  not pdas . 
but the taste of this stuff is terrible . 
no ,  not so much !  my hair is dryer and  heavier  . 
my wife ,  son and iall tried this and there was no comparison . 
this book s recurring emphasis on vitamin c might suggest that i am offering a song with only one verse . 
i now have purchased a product that is not appropriate for my device . 
too much sugar and an unpleasant salty taste and like some other reviewers stated ,  it made me nauseous . 
cons : there are ,  like ,  num_num types of parabens in this product . 
it charged fine ,  but it just started falling apart after about a month . 
the pointed end of this knife is not serrated . 
graphics and sound are very nice for the psp ,  i ll give it that . 
it was so badly bent that i had to use a screwdriver to separate the panels . 
you can access all of the buttons on the fac of the phone . 
in either case i was very disappointed that they had such a reaction n will give away . 
i actually sell revlon where i work ,  yet it s not my favourite . 
i have older coffee makers that still work after num_num years . 
for me the only thing that this does is dry my nails ,  and the bottle is so small . 
what i didn t care for was how bulky the liner was when rolled up . 
by chance if i get lucky and get the cover on ,  it seems to fit fine . 
i m only giving it two stars instead of one because it actually has some really great ingredients in it . 
the best part was the dark chocolate coating ,  the inside left something to be desired . 
i never got it to work for me . 
we both use our phones a lot ,  so i ordered us each one of these chargers . 
some of the reviews said order up and some said order your normal size . 
also ,  the little blue shelf always falls off . 
another crosman piece of junk took it out of the box ,  and it is rattling . 
set it up quickly ,  and it immediately recognized and connected to my netgear wireless router . 
next was the game play ,  which was slow ,  and added to the boredom . 
we had some tears over the crap product . 
noisey .  .  . if you want animals to stay away from you then use this tether . 
maybe if we put a hat on top of these it would help block the light . 
when the original tenchu :  stealth assassins came out in num_extend it was a big step in gaming . 
i found it to be more tedious than fun . 
i try to get him to come to me or try to calm him down but nothing helps . 
would buy again once my puppy has stopped chewing . 
from what i have observed this past week ,  it would not be effective . 
just warm when frothing milk for a single cup . 
there are button lock options ,  though . on the other hand ,  there are no temperature lock features . 
just turn the difficulty down if it becomes frustrating . 
this adapter is slower than my canon rebel xt . 
stay away no matter how cheap it gets . 
this was such a waste of money and space in my house . 
go here ,  do this; go there ,  do that .  .  . but no overall plot . the dialog is weak . 
yes ,  it smells real good ,  yes it does soften hair ,  but i m really not impressed with it at all . 
i wish id read the negative reviews before i bought this . 
i am buying a new container to store a second type of cat food . 
the plastic around the mirror is weak and cheap . 
this oxo kettle is so close yet so far . 
i can t understand why this mascara would smudge without being rubbed or getting wet but it does . 
also states misuse of product by inhaling can be fatal . 
i do not know if it shipped out that way or if it got damaged in transit . 
it seemed like it would leave a rash if worn for more than a few minutes . 
had to buy another type of charger because this one didn t worked for my samsung galaxy num_extend
the material of the soffe running short is not what is used to be . 
had all kinds of issues with this item . 
for one thing ,  this game is way too linear  even the original castle wolfenstein gave players more choice  . 
really awful design . the product works on the principle of suction ,  so be careful when flipping it over to hang . 
when i returned the product ,  i paid the shipping out of my pocket . 
i probably should have just trashed it . i debated for a long time before purchasing another . 
but ,  for me ,  it s just not worth the mess of the bronzer . 
honestly ,  i have a lot of blackheads on my nose . 
they d exploit the bugs mentioned early ,  drive down ,  and score ,  and keep doing this . 
absolutely no hard surface should touch the surface of this pan if you expect any longevity from the product . 
hers broke within a week; mine broke within two months . 
stupid thing shows your pictures on the folder . 
nowhere to be found so i can t continue the game . 
i love most of the other regenerist items and i had high hopes for this ,  too . 
it seems to happens when i make strong coffee . 
first thing i cooked ,  stuck so bad ,  i transferred to a different pan to finish cooking . 
so no matter what you do ,  you have to follow a linear path . the gameplay is a mess as well . 
this truly is about the worst product i have ever purchased . 
i would definitely buy them again ,  but never online . 
most of the tender locs have broken couplers . 
this game is boring and it s just collecting stuff in your car . 
i have also read many accounts of pyrex developing micro cracks you can t see . 
really cheap flimsy and took almost num_num weeks to get . 
while it worked i enjoyed watching tv in peace ,  hence num_num stars . 
i noticed that these lee jeans did shrink a little with each wash . 
i blended it ,  and could see the blemish  red  peeking through ,  while the green remained stubbornly green . 
similar to another reviewer ,  i bought this at the recommendation of a respected test cooking kitchen . 
i would especially recommend against nylon harnesses if your dog is of a bully breed . 
why amazon would consider this  unsweetened almond milk  is beyond my imagining . 
not to mention how many better games there are for num_extend
i would not recommend this case even though it is partially due to the slide out keyboard . 
it is no solid num_extend setting it up was no walk in the num_extend not chewproof . 
they go play ,  stop ,  pause instead of play ,  pause ,  stop . 
it worked well ,  but after constant use for num_num weeks they broke . 
i followed the directions for placing the patches . 
these fit another friend and she is even smaaller then the friend i gave the shorts to . 
i have purchased num_num bags of this brand . 
you can obviate solving this puzzle with your inventory . 
one packet just doesn t cut it for one cup . 
terro s instructions suggest that the solution works for a month . 
maybe it s me but i cannot charge the phone with the cover on . 
first miss this year at a deer ,  and that wot happen again . 
there s no way my son could ever build it himself ,  but building isn t really his thing . 
strap started to unravel in the same spot twice . 
if you like miso try it for yourself . 
you also gain access to all their powers . 
i did not refuse to provide an order number . 
the lid has separated from the plastic pump part . 
documentation it ships with are among the worst i have seen . no signal meter . 
it s just not enough to fill you up at all . 
you can boil the flakes and make rich ,  delicious ,  creamy ,  oily coconut milk . 
this thing will likely liquify them too .  .  .  . not a great product . 
i am a true coffee lover and it is my favorite beverage morning or night . 
it s a decent oven and can hold a lot of food . 
i tried for over num_num days without success . 
the back silver piece was broken off  , was like num_extend when i got it the case . 
i don t know about you ,  but replacing my phone would cost me about $ bucks . 
i guess i got off cheap because next time it won t ever be a dirt devil again . 
that s a whole lot better than the num_extend one you also see here and other places . 
i m leaving the other car as is for now . 
there are a lot of problems like this due to no espicific information . 
it even leaks when upright in the freezer . 
we re not cool enough for a technic turntable ,  etc . 
does not work with cakes placed on turntable . 
no go ,  i could still hear some air hissing out somewhere . 
i ve owned it for about a year and a half and am desperately in search of a new machine . 
they wouldn t go past the first carpeted step . 
the instructions were written so that if something went wrong the instructions were useless . 
it smells very synthetic and just not good; too sickeningly sweet . 
with things like these ,  it s like ,  the audio pins will work but the mic pin won t ,  or vice versa . 
the grind was large and looked like something had been mixed in with the coffee to  stretch  it out . 
this is the only cat food i have tried that  may  have caused stomach issues . 
not the case at all with the clean and clear . 
it has a silicone feel to it and had to reapply all day long . 
the actuator on the press i received is made of plastic . 
the holes in the car tend to deform with time . 
my num_num year old gets frustrated because she wants to operate this toy by herself . 
this is called infusion heat therapy and is said to be the most therapeutic kind of heat . 
tons of variety ,  and just a great activity for a rainy day with your kid or kids . 
i m glad i didn t pay money for it . 
so i gave the unopened one to our neighbor s num_num year old english setter . 
making this a rental if you really want to play this . other problems also exist in the game play . 
this camera is way too small to even be seen . 
by then they are ready for the regular leap pad . 
there is very little interaction needed for the child to do things ,  the toy mostly just talks at you . 
a smooth consistent green tea flavor . i repeated this num_num weeks later with a different batch of bigelow s . 
only the last two levels are really hard and frustrating regardless if the game is on easy . 
the end result was a baked product that tasted foul . 
it said it was going to make my skin look more youthful . 
however the price has gone up from just under $ to over $
they bend to the shape of anything ,  and are never flat again . 
i gave this to my parent s cat who s normally very playful . 
i ll keep the corning mug for home use only . 
i m not sure how it claims num_num to num_extend
i can t talk on the phone and it doesn t have any sound . 
i immediately washed the crap out of my hair with my pantene shampoo . 
this item is very disappointing it is so flimsy that it is unusable . 
i tried everything in the book ,  and nothing would switch computers . 
i just hope i can stand the smell to be able to use all of it . 
i guess it just depends on the person . 
this strap is completely and utterly worthless to me . 
all i d like to do is exchange it for a new one or have them replace that usb plug . 
i found a better battery that does what it says it will do . 
very weak cable it broke after a couple of uses with my silent violin ,  . 
the company admitted that they use some vitamins from china . 
the legs weren t long enough to support the weight of the phone . 
it could not go num_num hours without crashing . 
the keyboard seems to shut itself off if it isn t used for a few minutes . 
my num_num month old puppy tore this apart in less than num_num hours . 
hp really screwed up on these and did not make it right with their base . 
the box could have been cardboard ,  or something recyclable . 
but i can t see anyone actually giving this game the time to really progress in the game . 
unfortunately they tinkered with it and the end result is a nightmare . 
face is small but heavier than it looks . 
over the past year the number of games being released on the cube has dropped significantly . 
and also landed myself with a $ vet bill  sigh .  .  .  definitely wouldn t advice this to anyone . 
swimsuit still smelled like a bottle of chlorine . 
cheap plastic with a giant sticker on it ,  they just don t make things like they used to . 
this was so soft that you could bite right through it . 
this is the most dissapointing pc game i have bought in quite a while . 
i expected them to be the same quality as my old  goody  rollers . 
i was able to remove the pops easily by running two under hot water . 
cracks in the bases of two of the three jars after just two uses . 
however , it would be a more attractive product if it were easier to ingest . 
not the spicy cinnamon you can smell either . 
i ended up trying a different brand of tahini and wow ,  delicious results . 
all the phone was doing was sitting on my counter next to my num_extend and my wife s num_extend
when i placed the order this set was the best one i could find for my price range . 
i think this was more of a personal preferance . 
they are all different sizes and look  patched  together . 
the corner tabs insure the cake fall to what ever surface you put under it . 
maybe they are rugged and will hold up well ,  bose has a reputation for that . 
i used it exactly two times over a two day period and then it died . 
super axel ,  super thumper ,  super slamm ,  and super auger from num_extend
the biggest problem with this product is the roller . 
the sound and clarity are fine even when walking around in noisy areas . 
what else could i expect for the price !  . 
some of the solutions just don t make a lot of sense . 
that pot made the best cup of cofee you could get ,  and it was hot ! p . s . 
and the two pieces of wood don t line up together on many of the clips ,  so it s lopsided . 
i watched utube and people swore by this products so i had to try it . 
as some have added to comments about it ,  you shouldn t sharpen your knives every day or after every use . 
took her off and the rash went away completely in num_num days . 
i love my canon digital cameras so i thought i d get a canon minidv . 
my calphalon pan does not have this smell at all ,  even though i have cooked similar foods in them . 
i do not know if the hole would fit road pedals ,  but not spd . 
had to quickly pull it out of car ,  almost too hot to handle . made in china possibly !  ?  . 
wanna roam around bashing into random people ?  no problem . 
it has a horrid taste and even worst after taste unlike any licorice i have ever eaten . 
vacuum has very big wheels ,  moves about well and has an automatic cord winder . 
the second shot still gave no hint of a flavor . 
so now ,  im running the game using directdraw from my geforceddr . 
going to try the new skinomi next ,  hope it works better . 
i love this product but within one day the pump doesn t seem to push the water out as well . 
i think they are part of unilever company .  . and so i will avoid any unilever products . 
i m not shy about wearing tight shirts ,  but i couldn t even get my hand through the sleeve . 
i really needed one that was much taller than this one . 
hagreds drinking beer in a barn while you find other peoples stuff . 
could be that each bra was manufactured in different countries . 
it worked really well for a month or two . 
the  ear attachment  and its hinge is made of flimsy plastic . 
if you like it after trying it ,  buy a copy . 
i wasn t sure that was a viable option anymore . 
my usual castor oil concoction is nothing like this and so i found myself checking out the ingredients . 
i ve never had a problem with oily hair before . 
it smells amazing ,  but i will be dumping this out . 
num_num days ,  not a single bee or bug of any kind . 
they are simple to make ,  inexpensive ,  and tasty . 
my dishes were left in better condition ,  although not everything was washed off of the glasses . 
i told her i called in dec and she said  someone else likely helped you  . 
has to be reset num_num to num_num times a day on average just loses connection . 
sadly ,  i don t think the game designers have ever been near a horse . 
i will think twice ,  and read some reviews ,  before purchasing another sierra product . 
there are much ,  much better products out there . 
if anyone else has had this issue please comment ,  as i would like to know what caused it . 
one would have to be a complete moron and an imbecile ,  to buy this junk . 
it isn t ,  it is done with a draw string . 
it arrived with three sides visibly bent inward . 
the moment it touched his claws he freaked like i was trying to amputate his paws . 
after adding raw green tripe to his diet ,  i am noticing similar positives . 
as a result ,  the seam on the corners of the bag does not lay flat on the box . 
i ve purchased vaxa pro tec here on amazon and they are pharmaceutical grade . 
and usually jackets that are medium can run somewhat snug on my body . 
the graphics are simple and the environments are easy to navigate . 
at first if was hard to get the attachment on the dryer and it seemed very cumbersome to use . 
this costs way too much ,  it hold way too little ,  spend the extra for the num_num or whatever . 
i was recommended this product by a hair stylist . 
i boght the football and ball shape at a local discount store  ocean state  . 
since i added the water after the mix ,  i never had problems with the cocoa powder dissolving . 
i have been using microsoft ergonomic keyboards all the time . 
the plot moves through a series of cutscenes . 
the wire was enough to reach the pad that holds the phone . 
if wanting to cover darkness from scars and really dark circles ,  this formula won t do it . 
probably a good price and the mirror looks well made . 
i got this game for ten bucks on the bargain pile . 
i had showered that morning but still the smell came through . 
for some reason the plot gets a lot of praise ,  i for one have no idea why . 
num_extend year old ,  num_num pound yorkie  but he loves it . 
these just can t stand up to the original miniature version . 
it has been washed on gentle cycle on a front loader machine . 
i am using it for an audible book which is supposed to start where you left off . 
these looked descent when put up in my travel trailer but where on the floor the next day . 
i did that a couple times and the smell was gone . 
it cut quickly in all other areas . here is another huge problem with this shaver . 
i am not sure how hasbro can sell such a piece of junk . 
this one should not be on its website . 
used it on my xbox to clean the lense and it didn t clean it at all . 
i even pulled up my slacks properly before crouching . 
the grinding selector and timer do not seem to work . 
after it ripped ,  it was no longer stable and would not support me in a sitting position . 
but their capes for some reason are flat and are in num_extend
a lot of printing companies use these because they re cheap . 
it does not have a powered brush bar and so therefore it just does not spin . 
why in the world would i chance another kodak camera . 
granted ,  i m a runner; i need my breasts to be held in place . 
he refused to use it and pooped on the floor . 
very synthetic tasting with a strong bitter aftertaste . 
i contacted the seller and was told they would send a replacement right away . 
i humbly suggest that you remove this listing and put this seller on probation . thanks !   : o  . 
their cuts and scrapes would use this product up in a few days . 
the line is not at all durable ,  and puppy chewed it up in the first num_num minutes . 
i thought that my dane would like this toy ,  because he likes to chase and kick water bottles . 
this juice is too feminine smelling for a man s cologne . 
i ve used the green machine trimmer and had better ,  consistent results . 
the brushed stainless steel finish allows overflowed batter to slip right off after the iron has cooled . 
it is also compact and lightweight . the disadvantage is that it isn t anywhere near as bright as a flare . 
at first i thought it is a good product and gave it a num_num star review . 
it s an awkward and ineffective broom for a child . 
not in my old toastmaster that knead evenly all different sizes of dough . 
i took the baby away from my daughter until recently . 
maybe i didn t have some obscure setting correct but i looked all over and couldn t find one . 
their products suck  !  if you want a good product ,  look elsewhere . 
these bra inserts would not even stand up to the pressure of a light tshirt . 
it has gotten so loud that i have to trash it and look for another headset . 
the center was cracked by week two and by week three i had to toss it . 
you have to right it and then push the button again . 
very fast delivery ,  returns made simple for sure . 
i m not gonna complain to much because its only num_num bucks but they re garbage in my opinion . 
as the title says this is the worst game of the year . 
pay the extra to get what you want . pay the shipping and i will send you my num_num cans . 
it s really small but the regular ipod is catching up to it . 
i bought this router and everything seemed to work fine at first . 
it can still drain batteries ,  turn off both the microphone and the control box . 
there are plenty of safe toys out there to choose from . 
it was so small and the quality is so cheap . 
we cleaned out the container each day and used vinegar to clean the heating element . 
the litter started to leak out of various crevices each time i cleaned it . 
i did not notice or feel any benefits after using this product . 
personally i dispiesed the game but you know what peer pressure does to you . 
then bam they are drained in a couple hours with regular use . 
it s also lighter than i expected ,  i m not sure if that s a good thing or not . 
the product quickly dissipated the foam in our pool . 
i got a set of these as a wedding present years ago . 
sure enough ,  i switched to other mascaras and the burning sensation stopped . 
this didn t make it past the num_extend chew session . 
it didn t read num_extend then either but i figured hey ,  probably a fluke . 
i placed it on the charger for num_num hours per the directions . 
and the price !  my goodness !  i m going to have to stock up . 
there is num_num grams of sugar in each num_num tbs per serving . 
and you need to apply it many times . 
it has a very strange taste ,  not fruity at all . 
cannot get it to talk wirelessly to the belkin router . 
relative to the price ,  the shipping costs turned out to be very high and delivery was poor . 
the original photo finish is a gel ,  the photo finish light is a lotion . 
this feeder came poorly packed ,  hence instead of arriving full assembled ,  it was in several pieces . 
this is the worse thing i ve every purchased from amazon and i ve traded with them for years . 
all it did was make my skin feel greesy and look shinny . 
other than that ,  just about any other gaming system is % better . 
i bought these underwear to accommodate my expanding body since i m currently pregnant . 
first ,  i did not know that i was only going to get one pair for the price i paid . 
it was also very slippery to cock the firearm . 
the list of ingredients is long and contains milk products . 
this would be a cute table centerpiece for a dog theme party . 
our household has num_num iphones and num_num ipads as such we have many cables all around the house . 
well ,  i guess i will start with this complaint . 
i love the way it smells ,  it feels great going onto your skin ,  but it s just not for me . 
the cross hairs rotate inside of the tube ,  after a few shots it turned into an  x  . 
the battery stopped after only a few months and time and date is off . 
you can t keep yourself happy and do all the other things in the short amount of time you get . 
i have hardwood floors in my home ,  and i used this mop to clean a tiny bedroom . 
there are no graphics so you arcade boxing type fans wouldn t like it . 
we ve had it around for the past couple of years and it s seen a fair amount of play . 
i do like the product and it did hold my ipad steady even with a leather case on . 
also ,  it does not specify if the bell is zinc and nickel free . 
the thing that bothered me the most was all of the talking that goes on . 
since then it has sat on the floor collecting dust . 
but it does not keep them flea free for num_num days ,  like they advertise . 
i was disappointed with that which is a big factor ,  especially as a christmas gift . 
i thought that the battery was dead ,  so bought a new one and put it in . 
on the other hand ,  if you really really really like cologne ,  then you ll love this product . 
you will notice one side of the blade gets a beautiful glint ,  while the other has like . 
another thing i found odd was that this game came on a single cd . 
this one didn t make the cut . the tea bags are weird . 
i don t know why this has such inflated reviews . 
i really dint like this product as per the quality and ol . 
he found this on woot and was the envy of the office . 
i will return to olay and burts bees products . 
the fan has always iced up whether we supplement with ice or not . 
the only feature i enjoy is that the unit is concealed and looks very high tech . 
i think this has an ingredient i have an allergy to . it makes my skin very red . 
the price is too expensive and footsmart charges excessively for shipping . 
one little scratch went through the protector and got my phone . 
the only other brand of acetly l carnatine  alcar  that i have tried is jarrows . 
but not now . the most irritating thing is fighting . 
not made of leather ,  but made of vinyl over cardboard . 
so cheap compared to the unit i just reviewed . 
for it s cost and performance ,  i recommend that you buy this one . 
i even tried what one reviewer suggested ,  putting them in from the back first ,  nope . 
 example ,  you hear the voices of the people talking ,  but their mouths never num_extend the game cheats . 
however ,  you can get the same result from a heavy shampoo for color treated hair . 
i resorted to using the keurig to brew a cup of hot water and using a tea bag . 
with tech support ,  i finally found the num_num mb driver file i was supposed to download . 
i will give them credit for the graphics . 
but once i added in the num_num filter cartridge the water wasn t getting cleaned . and the water kept getting cloudy . 
when it came it was a breeze to setup . 
i decided to try the wax on my eye brows instead later but it was a nightmare . 
it is very inexpensive but other than that ,  i wouldn t recommend it . 
to make matters worse ,  i got a lot of white specks from it . 
very unefficient if you re looking for solar charger ,  otherwise quite well built . 
the labels print fine ,  but the adhesive on these labels is terrible . 
if you re looking for something to make using your touch screen easier to use .  .  .  . save your money . 
in it arsenic is found at a whopping num_extend
the headphones work but there are many issues . 
guess i ll just have to use it for serving ,  not cutting . 
i bought these cause they were unshelled and cheaper ,  but not anymore . 
cross the street and find a better game . 
this metal ring is really thin and will wear out fast . 
they go nuts over mini nerf balls ,  but this does not seem to keep their interest . 
it is very quiet and very cheap ly made . 
these strippers will work but surely are not original quality and fit . 
i have celiac and i am unable to eat these beans . 
online play isn t worth mentioning ,  but i ll do so anyway . 
it has num_num card slots ,  came with a plastic insert for pictures ,  and even has a zippered change pocket . 
environments are ok but there are a lot of jagged edges and it could have used some polish . 
but it didn t reach; for some oddball reason ,  the drive s plugs are very far apart ,  and the extension isn t . 
i had two of these fail within a year or two . 
the water was slightly sour and it was a real chore for me to finish a num_num ounce container . 
solution ?  be a man  or a woman  and get a casio gshock and be happy as hell about it . 
i bought this popper based on recommendation of a popcorn fanatic friend who owns the same model . 
if you don t mind you house smelling like armpit spray don t get his scent . 
they slide all over and are super annoying especially when you are trying to workout . 
even though my dog is just an average chewer ,  he is very smart and breaks things so fast . 
i would not buy this again . also ,  this isn t the first one we got that did this . 
the first one we bought froze when the temperature went down to num_num degrees fahrenheit . 
it really could be a bad batch or the mail truck stored it somewhere heated . 
call quality is superb and hands free works flawlessly too . 
the game is similar to grand theft auto in concept ,  but not at all in execution . 
try changing resolution or color depth  and on xp . 
i think you could keep the original film and get similar results until you can afford a better protection . 
it does have a  hint  of what i perceive as artificial coffee flavor . 
i thought it was made from whole grain brown rice ,  my bad . 
this treat dispenser is terrible at dispensing treats . 
i just didn t realize what that taste was until i came across the other review . 
push num_extend to use binocular ?  then you have to hold the right mouse button to use it . 
i can see this being an excellent bluetooth stereo headset for the physically active  not so much me ,  there  . 
the idea is great but you have to find a window that isn t near a tree with squirrels around . 
after about a minute ,  he gave up and kicked mickey over to his younger siblings . 
this game commits the cardinal sin of video games :  it s very boring . 
wheel started to squeak early on ,  about num_num weeks in . 
you have to boil it for a couple of minutes and it likes to boil over . 
don t believe the descriptions !  i ordered this num_num weeks ago now the delivery estimate is the end of november . 
i now use only the plastic bolts  they have metal target tips  sold by amazon and other sites . 
and i think they could have been more creative with that num_extend thing . 
it s like not hearing the violin in an orchestra . 
i thought i would try the lower profile sock and i will not be buying more . 
i feel groggy for the most part of the morning after taking it . 
i have purchased other products that have received mixed reviews on amazon and found the negative reviews misleading . 
i hit num_num stars to try to be neutral for now . 
i thought i wasn t setting them up right because everyone talks so lovingly about bose . 
not only are they very thin ,  they are small . 
i rated it num_num stars because i would like comments on sleep issues with iodine . 
tried the forum fix mentioned by a previous reviewer but update fails every time . 
worked well for some days and then just started to spill out the bubble liquid . 
this toy is extremely loud ,  and there is no volume switch either . 
as with in most cases though ,  more does not mean better . 
the number one problem is the size of the lounging shelves or whatever they re called . 
the tip broke the very first time of use ,  its a total waste of money . 
they now include a notice to press hard to attach it ,  but that s not enough . 
i would much rather use natural essential oils than toxic chemicals on my dogs . 
it can even hover a little ,  which serves no real purpose ,  but is still pretty cool . 
it seems to be ok if you leave the defaulet share and basically a wide open share disk num_extend
i got this toy because i thought my dog would like it and it would be durable . 
she pulls the pegs out and puts them in her mouth . 
if you have access to dead or alive num_extend try putting out leifang . 
there are better things like this out there ,  and cheaper too ,  so i will not buy these again . 
i will be returning this to tjmaxx tomorrow . 
i did finish my order and will not reorder . 
when i put it on my phone ,  the lip that goes around the front of the phone was uneven . 
that is the only plus . sorry garden of life . 
you would think this antenna was amplified but it s not . 
hat is very small is size even though on size fits all . 
i tried to contact topeak to buy a replacement part from the company ,  but i got no response whatsoever . 
i am going to try the other type of bowl with num_num prongs . 
put huge set out for free ,  no one would take it . 
it doesnt even cradle one of my kayaks very well . 
the point of this was to put in gift bags for party favors so wanted them individually wrapped . 
they are so crappy that the num_num bucks i paid was way too much . 
there also don t appear to be any health packs so that you can replenish your health . 
he s very slender ,  so it s hard to find jeans that fit . 
quake num_num is just a pretty mediocre fps . 
iron supplements are a major poisoning source for kids . we tried these in place of our regular vitamins . 
this product was touted to be the best lubricant available . 
the board senses the number when the light is blocked as the number is fitted into the number spot . 
they are amply described in just about all the review areas for the lacie drives that amazon sells . 
judging from reviews ,  most other people feel the same num_extend
i plugged it in and immediately it said % battery and never even turned the phone on . 
however ,  she didn t feel that it make enough of a difference to keep taking them . 
i ordered this cleaner based on amazon reviews and it s price . 
i would love this little num_extend player ,  but i have already had to duck tape the battery cover on . 
the silverware basket  which did not match the drainer  was attached with clear tape . 
at a time on low and the food would not be burned . 
and if u get it wet then ur screwed . 
it looked like spoiled tuna salad and smelt even worse . 
i have a dachshund that is about num_num pounds . 
i diligently took them and finished off the bottle . 
while in the shower then comb through it then rinse it out . 
i don t do much reviews but this needs a good one . 
i can t stand the lid ,  it doesn t stay on and it keeps falling off . 
nothing changed in skin ,  maybe i should use longer . 
too little was known about them and i didn t find them interesting . 
alas ,  this had no discernable effect on my cats . 
it s saturday ,  you re looking forward to a relaxing day at home . 
the footbed was also very cushy ,  like many crocs . 
whatever the merits of the kindle ,  i know from experience that amazon customer service lives up to its name . 
these earphones do weird things at num_extend and above . 
real speck products are a goo value and quality ,  and should get good reviews . 
we will likely keep looking . first of all ,  the bottom section that fits inside the hat is very large . 
you ll see your frames slow down really bad . 
i guess we can consider one star to mean  won t kill you straight away  . 
my pain level is constantly moderately severe ,  and acutely severe at least several times per week . 
they are really not what i have come to expect from melissa and doug products . 
the metal pitcher was too hot to touch and the actual temperature was num_num deg f . 
i bought this because i had previous excellent experience with the smaller firehose toy . 
i just ordered another model and will give this one away to the salvation army . 
i was very disappointed and won t buy these again . 
however ,  i was unable to get my feet started into these slippers . 
i hear them talking and come closer ,  so i begin to fire . 
i have only seen one deer  a huge buck  touch the wires . 
make sure you know the size before you buy . 
i bought these for my tendonitis and carpel tunnel . 
i was so excited i immediately went to the sink and washed my hands with it . 
i can no longer use the phone since the lcd is broken . 
i had read about the hard anodized aluminum pans and thought i would like them . 
i wish there was a warning on the package to discourage use of rechargeable batteries !  . 
if i did ,  i d buy it and take it . 
the air output was sufficient ,  but the noise it emitted could not make up for this . 
the bottom is covered in those because none of my birds eat them . 
i tried the portable xm radio myfi to improve my channel selection . 
so this old plaque is over one year old . 
this bar may have simple ingredients ,  but i could not deal with the taste  not sweet enough for me  . 
i saw it at the grocery store for much less of the price here . 
i guess i like the little patterns and the fact that they breathe . 
maybe go with a brand that i trust even though it costs a bit more . 
even when it is  working  this raid unit with these drives was slower than it should be . 
unfortunately ,  in use it did not work very well for me at all . 
in short ,  i d advise those looking for a usb adapter to get the microsoft one ,  although it s not cheap . 
when looking and the reviews ,  i saw that one person said that it smelled like old lady perfume . 
i consider myself an average video gamer  no hardcore by any means  . 
i have eczema and this product made it worst . 
i was thinking maybe they got too hot in the ups truck and lost their elasticity . 
the product was listed and pictured as a num_extend  color rating  bulb . 
i went to the doctor ,  got weighed ,  and went straight home and weighed myself . 
it s from palm oil and palm kernal oil ,  but don t confuse this with the good stuff ,  folks . 
the crampbuster does not work as advertised for me . 
the weight of this unit literally pulls it out of the socket . 
this game no longer spins in my disc tray . 
this product seems to have been hastily slapped together and shipped with very little quality control . 
but i will not be purchasing another one of these . 
however ,  the problem is bad enough for me to stick with my canon num_extend
i ve used this cleaner on my whole house ,  and was very happy with the results . 
my husband and i suffer from stiff neck pain from time to time . 
i had to push down on the lid with a cloth to keep it from spurting everywhere . 
both of them are not performing as expected . 
however ,  the battery will not charge through the defy xt . 
well ,  people will argue with me ,  i m just waiting for the comments . 
haven t really tried any of the other settings . 
but its just way to simple even on hard mode . 
so today s game market is pretty well if not over saturated with strategy games . 
then i am on the happy side instead of the wasteful side . 
my lover bought this for me as a surprise ,  because we like that sort of thing . 
i will not be purchasing these again and go back to the blue ribbon brand . 
lighting and colors seem a little off at times . probably the worst aspect of this game is the terrible ai . 
now i use as a concealer if a have a breakout and it works pretty well for that . 
but it s made of very cheap and thin materials ,  and is not safe for littles . 
i am going to have to stick withvitamins ,  and not worry about it . 
as is most tea that you buy in a grocery store . 
then ,  as the num_num storms began to move in ,  they noticed the radio was silent . 
i dumped these and purchase them ,  instead . all of the ratings are num_num star on amazon . 
our older dog has bad breath and i thought this would help . 
we bought this seat for our stationary bike thinking it would be large and supportive . 
you never know when you will find that elusive perfect for you product . 
complimentary ,  i just couldn t take it past three sips . 
in the end ,   dawn of mana   hereby dubbed  dom   is a dud . 
for a pricey name brand ,  this is not good . 
i bought a battery tender to keep the battery charged ,  because of the lack of use . 
all the corners and i have very small hands and stick couldn t reach into it to clean it properly . 
personally ,  i just like to make drip coffee from flavored beans . 
no other characters from the movie are featured !  . 
this one cracked and spewed num_extend gallons of water before it was caught . 
i just wish i could figure out a way to drink it easily . 
and if you wear it in the gym ,  you ll have to clip it to your collar of your shirt . 
they sent me purple for my little boy . 
guild wars is a truly unique game indeed ,  a mixture of genius and stupidity . 
i assumed that this piece was stainless ,  given that it s a kitchenaid ,  and i put it in the dishwasher . 
thought my daughter needed a small which was way too small . 
i was hoping to wear this on cancer run . 
she gets her head stuck in between them trying th escape . 
as a squirrel proof ,  small bird ,  outdoor feeder ,  i can only give it num_num stars . 
they seems to be good treats ,  but they are tough and hard for my puppy to chew . 
 tis a sad day when a even a purveyor of rouges and creams cannot be trusted in his promises . 
we allowed our butterflies to emerge and are keeping them captive through their natural life cycle  around num_num weeks  . 
then if that isn t bad enough it lingers in your mouth . 
though not great ,  the musical scores in this game are a nice touch . 
it did take some time to replicate the issue and search for a possible solution . 
i have never had this issue with dansko or clarks . 
as delivered ,  would not fit through the bedroom and bathroom doors in my house . 
i truly believe that the manufacturers have cheapened this product . 
that seems to make sense and i will try that next time . 
the volume rocks and it has more functionality to the controls and the layout . 
i wanted to see tight little green necklaces around trespassing mice . 
i read great reviews on this product so i had high hopes . 
drop this and your shells will go everywhere as the case breaks !  avoid . 
pac man ,  galaga ,  galaxian ,  dig dug and pole postion . 
one of them started leaking air in a week . 
but for me ,  i could never use this tablet for serious use . 
after pulling it out i wasn t surprised because the screw is made of plastic . 
products are usually a hit or miss with me . 
ea sports games are the reason why i bought the xbox num_extend
and when i contacted the manufacturer ,  i found out that all farberware cookware is now made in china . 
my billing address is currently ny and it was shipped to me in wa . 
i should stick with the one that works for me . 
it s ironic this product is for hair loss yet it created another problem for me . 
i have had it replaced once and still cannot replace the batteries without losing all the data . 
i didn t really care for the multiplayer either . 
did not work ,  received it and the headphones would not charge . 
it s called a curl perfector and i suspect it would do a really good job . 
the first one i ordered had a chip and had to be returned . 
you had to push hard and fast to get them to come out . 
are you kidding me ?  corn syrup ,  gelatin by products ,  and soybean oil . 
i wish every type of fan included cfm s in their information . 
this phone is the younger brother of those num_num phones . 
we took care of the phones and even bought gadgets for them . 
and no amount of brushing made it blend in . 
the first few lasted much longer than the most recent ones . 
the fan blade is made of plastic ,  so ,  theoretically ,  you should not have to worry about getting cut . 
num_extend this soap is not from shea butter . 
i can t figure out why this can opener is so highly rated . 
i tried countless applications over a matter of days ,  but nothing really changed . 
i bought this unit as a sales from amazon warehouse . 
im a huge zelda fan but this game was a complete dissapointment . 
a lot of girls are going to miss out on a good toy because of these reviews . 
you are giving your pets nothing but antibiotics daily . 
my advice is to look elsewhere for a charger ,  i m checking out the reviews for one myself . 
but after this purchase i do not believe i will buy them any longer . 
when amazon has a sale i stocked up with num_num cases . 
the vendor refused my request to cancel the order . 
i kept taking it for a week to be sure . 
don t even think about using them in colder ,  outdoor settings . 
before i ordered this i had tried garden of life s raw meal chocolate and vanilla flavors . 
lots of money for something that should be more accomadating . 
my num_num year old rescue that i ve had for almost num_num months now freaks out when i leave . 
well ,  today the price on both went crazy . 
but for me ,  the trouble overwhelms the joy . 
i ordered a pair of these with the highest of hopes . 
then the very last boss hits your guys and does trememous damage . 
lookssome characters don t look like the wrestlers in the real wwf . 
it does nothing good for my thick ,  wavy hair . 
hothands promised up to num_num hours of heat and gave me num_extend
i do like it ,  but bottom line ,  im glad i didn t spend the money on it . 
when i rubbed the lotion it was like water ,  very runny . 
it s very fast and easy and i didn t have problems with kernels flying all over . 
this king arthur pancake mix really misses the mark . 
in the beginning of the game ,  lara climbs a roof which houses a few crows and shacks littered about . 
anyways i m gonna try it and see how it works then ill write another review on it . 
they refunded all my money also gave me a $ credit in my account for the hassle . 
my order was cancelled after i was told it was shipped . 
the instructions say to microwave them num_num seconds . 
they then emailed me and told me to repurchase the item and they would refund me the difference . 
it comes from coconut ,  so it must not be denatured right ?  false . 
would like to return them for something better . 
but numerous other penalties are never even called . 
i am a huuuuge fan of the paper mario series . 
i was insanely disapointed with this bb cream . 
i think that s a bit much for such a little toy ,  four batteries max would be sufficient . 
i cannot believe i was stupid enough to buy this thing . 
the case doesn t even protect the front of the phone . 
maybe the bag i received was stale but wasted my money and tossed into the garbage . 
had one day of use of it until i noticed the leak inbetween the seam . 
this one of the worst games i have purchased for my computer . 
i find this game to be okay ,  i am not crazy about the camera and controller setup . 
i won t even carry this at my personal range . 
very frustrating . the wagon itself is quite heavy and thanks to the poorly designed front wheels hard to turn . 
i wanted to love this bowl ,  i really did . 
the problem area of our house is on the north side and we power wash it every year . 
so it no longer will hold that dog in . 
in order to avoid the accident ,  i had to use extra folds and that means lasting not long . 
these things are everywhere and they are extremely quick and difficult to target . 
i m sorry i wasted my money on this product . 
this is a poorly designed bird feeder that wastes seed . 
i loved all the features of my num_extend although the screen was really too small for internet browsing . 
it is a brilliant yellow ,  which indicates a fair amount of dyes in it . 
also note that i will be sending you out a replacement . 
i would never recommend this product to anyone . 
i have probably used it a total of num_extend times over the past three months . 
and letting the unit dangle from the antenna and audio out  or somehow attach it to prevent strain . 
i have ordered something else that i think will work better . 
i went to a local camper store and got a set there the next day . 
also cleaning it would be a total pain ,  and some of the intake holes were cracked upon arrival . 
i tried to play it myself thinking the game would change as you advance ,  but it doesn t . 
if i buy a num_extend roll for $ i get it with amazon prime next monday . 
research the web and you will find that you need molybdenum in your stainless steel to prevent corrosion . 
i was hoping for better results from this product . 
i ve gotten out of a car and appeared waist deep in concrete . 
this one has never made it to me . 
i owned a cheaper one that worked better  :   . 
the slipperiness dispersed very quickly and did not get the job done . 
it was bad on the xbox and now its bad on the pc . 
and will be shipped right back to macy s tomorrow . 
i purchased three of them in num_num weeks . 
there is also a lack of combat moves ,  so the game gets boring quickly . 
madden used to be the king of sports game ,  and still sells millions . 
my first purchase with amazon that i will be returning . 
had it been the same material with an inside seam ,  this may have lasted longer . 
i am going back to premium hair dryers . 
i have tried a lot of natural products to help me loose weight . 
gave the product to a friend and they seemed to like it . 
i was very disappointed in this ,  as i was looking forward to using it . 
fecal odor will be much more noticeable if you are transitioning from a fine clumping litter to the breeze . 
i wish these  improvements  actually improved this toy ,  instead of making it more frustrating !  . 
if i buy another one of these at least i have spare parts . 
i did not like the flavor of this drink at all . 
this charger is reliable for about num_num months . 
but for everyone else ,  stick with the original ,  or the apple flavor . at least ,  for your dog s sake . 
the screen would go black and i would have to take the case off just to end the call . 
i don t know if there is any trick to them or not . 
the alien artifacts are believed to be parts of a super weapon . 
maybe i got a lemon ,  but it should have lasted longer . 
kellogg s crunchy nut is basically corn flakes coated with sugar and microscopically sized nut pieces . 
and you feel like you are just moving water around . 
scoring any kind of combo is trial and error and unfair . 
did not come out good from the microwave . 
the second pair broke about num_num months later . 
now ,  i don t have any issues with the build quality . 
they have to be able to stand on their own without all the sugars ,  honey and creams . 
beats nothing but that is about all it beats . 
even in normal daylight it miss autofocus like a moron . 
they are of heavier cotton and the stitching in the area of the ribbed ankle is noticeably tighter . 
fortunately i had another one that just happened to fit . also ,  the latch is a little flimsy . 
counts down from num_extend then goes back up to num_extend counts down ,  back to num_extend ect ,  a million times . 
compared to splenda ,  it has a more noticeable  bite  . 
do not purchase this item !  !  i was hesitant to initially purchase because it s price was pretty high . 
at the end of a few hours i gave up on this game . 
the two pieces just slip together with nothing holding them together . 
if the baffle were sold separately ,  i would buy some more of those . 
apparently you have to clear the history just about daily to keep this from happening . 
lets face it ,  the ds is a new ,  innovative system . 
may be an easy fix ,  i don t know . 
so much for the  lifetime warranty against defects and breakage .   . 
the top peeled off and left the screen sticky and annoying . 
you don t get much control over the camera either . 
the product appears to be a quality item so i must assume my application skills are lacking . 
was excited to try this but sadly was disappointed . 
i usually have to switch back to the phone . 
i bo t this b cuz i m quite fond of square num_num the final fantasy series . 
when i saw this ,  i thought it would be rather appealing to dogs . 
the models and everything in the game are so bad it looks like a dreamcast port . 
i don t take long car trips using gps often so i didn t want to spend much . 
i wish i could say that this lotion made my skin smoother and more firm . 
the concept is so simple that i would have been better off improvising at home . 
it was like spritzing vanilla scented water in my hair more than conditioning . 
the product gets one star unplugged gets num_extend
that seemed easier . they promised a replacement by the first week of january . 
after num_num turn  by me  ,  i realised how fragile this toy is . 
i ordered an xtreme hoping for longer life and good performance . 
i ve been a big fan of vargo products . 
amazon gave me a full refund on this product . 
there is securely tight and very tight and there is katinkas tight . 
it provides both chemical ,  mechanical ,  and an automatic biowheel for biological filtration . 
it did not really hold much and kept toppling over . 
my stylus started having all sorts of problems after putting this protection on . 
when i bit down to form it ,  i noticed that my back teeth were not covered by this . 
as you can see by the older reviews this was an amazing product . 
my character was casting this ,  hitting for that ,  and ugh it was just a mess . 
almost instantly the entire right side of the screen failed . 
some dogs do seem to hear it and are repelled slightly . 
i already wore it or it would be going back . 
at least not by the amount i was expecting . 
i followed their sizing and i can barely breath with this thing on . 
or maybe the factory didn t coat it with a protective clear coating or something . 
really ?  because i m looking at it and there s no stamp . 
in other words if a parent is not present the marbles will get lost under the surrounding furniture . 
i ordered these to help alleviate plantar faciitis . 
i also have celiac friends and like to provide them gluten free snacks . 
anyone shorter than i would need a ladder to reach them . 
they are $ more than the journeyman belt ,  but well worth the cost in mho . 
i didn t realize it was missing until after i d left the restaurant . 
i called back tech support ,  after num_num min . 
the only thing he continued to play with was the balls throwing them around the house  . 
you are about to protect humans as lower caste from demonic high caste  i like being good guy  . 
i decided to measure the opening and to my surprise it was over an inch smaller than the description . 
it simply washed right out after one wash . 
the power button or on off button very sensitive and in the worst spot . 
i am surprised that this product has not been recalled . 
would not recommend this product to anyone over num_extend am num_extend
the arms on both sides of my head really felt like they were squeezing my head . 
to find a nursing bra in my size is difficult ,  and i will have to keep searching !  . 
this arrived and the colors were much darker than they looked online . 
it stopped for a while ,  but continued a few days later and still hasn t stopped . 
there are no hdr settings to take a good picture . 
although all of our friends wear these it just wasn t for him . 
however as someone who used to own multiple pairs of num_extend years ago i was sorely disappointed . 
i garantee they sent a really old bottle . 
winnie lite s slightly smaller wheels and the brake design and brake warranty are superior in my opinion . 
we have enjoyed the smaller green candy frogs in the past but these were not nearly as good . 
the second half of the episode demonstrated how much one couple s cat hated this litter box . 
you need to log into the  marketplace  and pay for those last few withheld levels . 
there is nothing i like about this product . 
i received a cheap version of the knife . 
the problem is that i can t get a smaller size ,  or she ll choke . 
i would give this zero stars if possible . 
i want results . my last digital broke while on a canoeing trip since i got it wet . 
perhaps i thought that it would make the time honored remedy of lemon and ginger easier . 
this game is not playable for me eventhough it may be promising . 
we ate one brownie each and threw the rest out . 
it is so ugly that i had to scrape the top layer off with a razor blade . 
i liked the pc and gbc versions ,  but this one has gone a completly different way . 
if you would feel bad about throwing away $ be warned !  . 
following the kit s instructions for vinyl flooring ,  i started puttingscrews into the joists . 
the second time the grinder made meat mush . 
sent me the wrong flavor so i m not overly thrilled with the product . 
sam s room is for bulk items from said store and other smaller storage . 
i think thid product smells funny and it just dries on top of my skin . 
it s lightly carbonated ,  which i like but too sweet for my taste  think strawberry candy  . 
if the phone falls ,  the case comes right off . 
and it smells really bad after a while ,  does not control smell well . 
i ordered and paid for next day air because i needed it this weekend . 
i am sure they would have been nice had i got them . 
it might be a different ,  more positive experience for someone else ,  but this has been ours . 
the product i received wasn t what was pictured . 
had to wait until monday to fix it !  buy sony instead . 
so i was excited to try these cashews as cashews are my favorite nut . 
it smelled like a cheap mask made by pantene . 
i love chocolate and decided to one day google  healthiest chocolate  and stumbled across vitalicious products . 
you ll be spending about $ more than if you ve bought num_extend but you ll surely be happy . 
the hardshell is very flimsy and obviously is very easy to break . 
i went to delonghi s web site and do not see the mixer listed anymore . 
it just makes it look like a smart phone from num_extend
as soon as i opened the door ,  my eyes started burning and i saw a little smoke . 
i bought this phone as a replacement phone for a friend who couldn t afford to replace his damaged one . 
that s enough of a reason to return it . 
took one taste and i threw it out . 
they draw very well and keep together great . 
i soak it and wipe it and it still comes out yucky . 
while beats is just awesome ,  everything else was just a slight upgrade improvement over the old incredible num_extend phone . 
although gives a little more give in length pulls cover so tightly making it look horrible . 
does not charge and blue light does not even turn on . 
very bad don t waste you time didn t do a thing for me at all but waste my money . 
the second email claimed  it takes time to update android versions . 
i took pictures ,  but ,  there isn t any way to load them on this site . 
the order was filled by the retailer  red rocket hobby shop  . 
i look good for one day !  if that s worth $ then go for it !  . 
the charging circuit for the plus does not work ,  however i can charge my iphone through the plus . 
i have hashimoto s ,  and not a single symptom has improved . 
do not buy this grinder for use with an espresso machine or french press . 
but if you are a gamer who enjoys online game . 
this is a good organic product for the price ,  but i didn t like the taste . 
the little mermaid for the gb is a very average game . 
xl was way too roomy in the bottom . 
i see other reviewers below have had similar bad experiences . i ll be sticking with bosch ,  etc .  ,  in the future . 
to me ,  the weight and size and function are most important . 
and when he does play with them ,  he doesn t chew on the treat rings . 
i mean this game reminded me of those god awful sega cd games . 
it seems to vary and some folks reported no odor . 
it s very pretty but with the borderline slippery surface and very thin mat i would not recommend it . 
they feel great on ,  they protect my knuckles and breath well but my palms blister after a half day . 
i used matrix gold heat spray which normally makes my hair so silky soft and smooth . 
you only see signs of life when you go into towns or dungeons . 
but he was not happy . i switched back to swheat scoop . 
the return shipment would have been more trouble than the price of the cable ,  so i didn t bother . 
i tested this against my num_num year pair and they are about half as thick . 
the flavor is good ,  but not better than the various canned soups you buy at the grocery store . 
i will update this review after i try changing the batteries . 
if it was just the picture on the website ,  i might think it was just my computer screen . 
the face protection creates an unnecessary gap between the screen and your ears . 
i don t like this tea compared to other yogi teas . 
and for just about every stage you re timed on them . 
my four year old girl is very excited about it ,  though . 
still ,  the fact that the game is  shiny  just can t warrant it a buy . 
pioneer works well with double din head unit . 
i dare not to eat it and had throw it away . 
i won t bother to return this because it just doesn t make sense with the shipping costs . 
it could have been a meal to eat out . 
it take sooo long to load !  it loads the loading !  i can t play it without finding a glitch . 
very disappointed in the quality of this game board . 
now dont just say my review is horrible because you like the game . 
i don t get how one out of three times i actually recieved what i ordered ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  . 
memeory cards will become more and more versatile into the future and soon be used in countless devices . 
i tried this for several months and did not have any positive results . 
fits as expected ,  true to size ,  same hoodie found at local discount store . 
he had other gifts and was fine but really wanted this to work . 
mmmm .  .  . switched to my cheapest $ from walmart pair and i could still make out the section . 
i am not an idiot that doesn t read instructions . 
i am not buying any ea games ever again until they remove securom and the limited installs . 
you can do as well with cheaper double sided tape from staples . 
if you eat gluten ,  it damages your intestinal num_extend
it s still okay i guess but the flow isn t as strong . 
after about half an hour ,  the tape is so wet that it s hard to hold . 
her husband was ready to deport her to stinkville . 
tried both the stove top and microwave directions ,  and got the same poor results . 
stardock releases all of their games % drm free and has been widely praised for it . 
i absolutely love that one and have used it nonstop at work all week . 
i bought it based on the high ratings and good reviews . 
it s compact and doesn t weigh too much which makes it great for travel . 
they taste artificially flavored and are not very appealing . 
nuts will become power while still also having pieces that are too large to use . 
last but not least ,  the cord tangled horribly . 
i have to take multiple pills twice a day ,  so have tried a variety of these things . 
the plus is we can buy replacement covers ,  but if they are that weak ,  it will get pricey fast . 
there s no getting around the physics of it . 
the color of this product does not match my skin tone . 
if water can get out .  .  .  .  . bugs can crawl in . i used one container with a screw lid that worked . 
this one has the beater and hook painted white . 
it is a constant fight to get mine to catch . 
will be contacting the seller for replacement strap or new set up . 
my entire tongue and mouth felt horrible ,  just before going completely numb . 
alpha testing is in house testing prior to beta testing . 
i mean the game just jumps to places with no explanation or reason . 
what could be better ?  as it turns out :  the construction . 
i purchased the beeman num_extend from amazon and it was delivered to my home today . 
i believe the reason for the kidney failure was too much bad bacteria and it destroyed her kidneys . 
tried for three hours to set up this print server . 
i ve only used these when they were included with the purchase of a new littermaid litter box . 
it s a terrible case and a waste of money !  . 
big mistake ,  these are very uncomfortable and they feel much bigger on my head . 
their support is also very slow and unresponsive . 
as i said completely worthless ,  save your money and get something ,  anything ,  other than this . 
it s a great game ,  but why does the num_extend nes super mario bros . 
handle s size is to fit maybe num_num year old s hand . 
the only saving grace visually is the art ,  which is quite nice . 
the next time i was shooting at num_extend inch targets at num_num yards rested on a bag . 
don t be like me and wait until it s too late to return it . 
and i have to really hammer on them to trigger . 
so you get an rma and ship the replacement back  your dime  and get another replacement .  .  . that does not fit . 
since it didn t have a great record on the reviews ,  i read all the reviews before purchasing . 
i noticed a hole ,  so the oven must have made that . 
its the worst tuna i ve ever had and super watery and not like any tuna i ve had before . 
but it s a food item and they don t allow it . 
what i ordered was chinese douchi fermented black beans produced by koon chun hing kee . 
we have a basset hound who just loves to bark and howl . 
quality is being sacrificed ,  and the public is being fleeced . 
i wanted to exchange it ,  but no answer !  . 
i ve been in a hospital bed for num_num weeks and one of my worst problems is my backside . 
you ll see the executions in a type of video sequences . 
num_extend graphics that make it look like the worlds are made of paper ,  and num_extend the glitches . 
and the two per lid side air vents ?  more detailed areas yet to be cleaned . 
it s thick and streaky and cakey and i never was able to make it look right . 
with its glass deck and large blue numbers ,  this is a very pretty scale . 
the droid wipes the floor with the num_extend camera . 
i would not recommend this product to anyone at all . 
seriously ,  if you are num_num feet tall and skinny ,  then these are for you . 
they re waste of money and they do not do anything . 
the screen was dented when it came ,  so back it went . 
they will eat anything that doesn t eat them first ,  so imagine my surprise that they wouldn t go near this . 
and we decided it was not a taste we were going to get used to . 
an ac adapter is included for those moments one is not near a computer . 
if your cat is more flighty it might work ,  but for our rather confident cat ,  it was a failure . 
honestly i dont know what the hype with bare minerals is . 
i bought this lotion after a friend recommended it . 
i ve had the phone dial out repeatedly ,  even when i did not touch the screen . 
this game was a huge disappointment to say the least . 
its hard to describe ,  but the field of vision is just lousy . 
plus ,  as other reviews reported ,  it does not fold down very far for nursing . 
it s basic serum mixed with a little bit of argan oil and a rat poison preservative . 
if you want your house to smell like you are deep in the forest then this is for you . 
over the years these things have been sold . 
it feels really greasy too ,  and in humid weather ,  i really hate using it . 
as for the taste ,  it was too sweet for my taste and not nearly spicy enough . 
also ,  it was not smooth at all at incorporating the dough . 
which is the whole purpose of spending hundreds of dollars on this thing in the first place . 
this coupled with the spotty voice recognition makes voice dialing an option i never num_extend
it s the only flavor i would buy again . 
my hair is pretty fine ,  so getting volume in the crown is a chore . 
if you have trouble clicking the screen rather than the top or need a tripod mount ,  go for it . 
something is wrong with the design cause beard trimming with these guys was not fun . 
if i connected it straight to the receiver ,  i got % on my channel meters . 
it s a shame because i do love the smell . 
it cycled water over a rounded surface ,  so the noise of the stream bothered them at first . 
we ve purchased several lego kits ,  and this by far is the most difficult to put together . 
sure the num_extend envorinment was nice ,  but the game play is much much more important . 
the crossbow is even sketchier ,  it misfires alt he time and is highly inaccurate . 
at least i can use the game as a coaster . 
they have their own room and they haven t touched it . 
i m not sure how this can be advertised as a belkin product . 
i ve moved everything from the phone memory to the sc card that is allowed . 
i bought this to hold my phone in the car . 
it can do it s job but this thing is super shady . 
now first off installing and connecting the adapter to your num_extend   .  .  .  takes way to much time . 
it does the job in the mean time . 
this shaver is very durable ,  nice looking and built well overall . 
i ve tried everything i can get my hands on to kill out this nest . 
and like most cats ,  they aren t too proud to groom each other s .  .  . ah .  .  . delicates . 
the colors on the product were really dull too . 
i decided that it was the small unmixed chunks of powder that made the drink so terribly unpalatable . 
the power cord was destroyed by jostling around during shipping . 
that s why i was excited to read the reviews on this product . 
you will be unable to play this on most systems . 
it is the same thing as every other sims game but you are in different places . 
reminds me of a harry potter movie . a few other complaints . 
she acts like she doesnt even smell anything at all when i spray it . 
they work great for a few months then short out and don t work any more . 
i wish i got the original sit n spin . 
this kettle makes a mess with every pour . 
i could still use it but i felt that i should get a new one . 
i used it ,  and the first time i used it ,  it wouldn t work !  . 
so slow my daughter isn t interested in it . 
it s hard to open and susceptible to spills . 
they squish flat even lifting my num_extend num_extend which is not a heavy car . 
i don t have an accurate count but suspect we cut less than ten potatoes before it failed . 
stay away from this companies microprocessor controlled chargers .  .  . they are junk ! notice that the price jumps around on amazon . 
my friend held her nose and drank her half cup but i could not force mine down . 
we picked tag up recently to replace this one . 
wish they would make a thicker book like they do with there phonics . 
i came across this qcell battery and it s a lifesaver . 
unfortunately it didn t came broken or anything ,  so i don t feel like returning it . 
buy the snap circuit stuff instead and the kids have fun for hours . 
here is a machine shop in michigan that will weld the front sight on for about $ more  . 
this is the first slr lens i ever used . 
the new unit has improved wireless security ,  but had the same problem plus the much talked  frequent disconnect  . 
the mfr bitterly reports that compusa ripped off his idea and built their own . 
make sure you like this before you buy a num_num pack . 
and second ,  some of the mice don t rattle at all . 
i wish i had read other users  reviews before hanging this . 
i would have rather have my old ,  original ,  corrupted droid x back . 
if i move the thermometer ,  the needle bounces around like a ball . 
please note that i am not a fan of flavored coffee so perhaps my expectations were just too high . 
a classmate wore undergarments with pink stitching and you could definitely see . 
cloudiness of the lenses was partially removed to about % better than it was . 
cheaper too !  this is overpriced big time ,  for what you are actually getting !  . 
tried it with black berry and rose thorns from my yard and easily pushed them right through . 
i liked all the other instant soups from mcdougall s i tried ,  but not this one . 
i finally had a chance to use it . 
i bought these because my wife has no idea what blood type she is . 
are you going to clip it to a telephone pole ?  it s laughably huge . 
i went through three filter cartridges in a week after adding this . 
however ,  some of these ingredients are controversial and may not protect that well . 
but then two days later it was drained again . 
these are the cheapest ,  worst cat toys i ve ever seen . 
having had other headsweats hats that fit me perfectly ,  i called the headsweats headquarters to inquire . 
also ,  the sizes run small ,  so keep that in mind when ordering . 
all stick after being used for a while . 
i have used thisfor a few weeks and see no difference . 
we stayed at a farmhouse in the woods with a giant yard this weekend . 
iphone on port num_extend android smartphone on port num_extend
this kit is a joke its so thin and weak . 
secondly i believe i m at fault by not reading the reviews before i purchased this product . 
my leonberger destroyed this kong in about three minutes . 
i bought this shaver back in august when it came out . 
the ball does not move very fast ,  and it seems a bit hard to locate . 
i make amazing banana bread !  i threw it out . 
they did come with a a nice little cloth to wipe the screen . 
they would do this over and over without playing the game . 
all i received back in reply was to change the apn . 
i guess you pay extra because it s elmo . 
i had read that some people may experience this and unfortunately i was one of them . 
this is usually used to get rid of major bugs using a small amount of  usually  employees . 
absolutely junk will not charge or hold charge . 
if you do plan to buy from this seller you may want to order one size larger . 
the cards are funny but even this losses its appeal after playing a couple of times . 
if i ran the smart configuration utility and hit apply ,  then everything would be fine until i restarted aol . 
this is the same reply they ve been sending to users for months . 
since this sale i have become a sportsmans guide regular . 
you cannot email them without creating an account . 
because they tend to fall out ,  i don t get as good of a sleep in them . 
mobile service providers claim that this type of antenna does not work ,  and i have to agree with them . 
either way ,  just be sure you know the problem your cat is facing before buying this product . 
guybrush threepwood in particular was num_num without being annoying . 
lens has very slow startup time and takes long to retract back . 
it makes a mess of my eyebrows and i end up having to redo them in a darker color . 
these are probably the worst sounding pair of headphones i ve ever used . 
i like l oreal products ,  but my skin began to show fine wrinkles after just a week . 
seems i can t figure out how to navigate an icy path from one door to the other . 
the first num_num are really just half the length of the latter num_extend
i don t want that in my body if i can help it . 
and i must say i care much because i knew what the fault could throw this console . 
would have liked this product if it wasn t so thick and was able to hold the cold . 
for the price this cost i would expect way better results like actually noticeable ones . 
it might work better for thick wood arrows than my thin composite arrows . 
i thought i might use it for the fish tank but i can t even do that . 
i was constantly having to worry about it and wiping it off . 
i would not recommend it to any buyer . 
it stays at % after charging for a day !  also gets very warm . 
so if you have a somewhat larger head i would not suggest these headphones . 
has an email address ,  wrote for suggestions twice ,  also no response . 
% longer battery life ,  very important in digital num_extend
it does have a cool squeak but i wouldn t recommend it because the felt is poorly fastened . 
our num_num year old likes it ,  but she has a very hard time doing it by herself . 
just how i would ve wanted it . if you aren t prone to dropping your phone ,  this case is perfect . 
anyway ,  i don t like it for that reason . 
as suggested by some other reviewers ,  i ordered the shoes size larger than i had in the past . 
i put this on my face and it felt alright for the first hour . 
you waste precious ammo and health packs before you realise that you can take multiple paths . 
when num_num people could play at the same time ! as for simpsons skateboarding , a big thumbs down !  !  . 
do not bet your life on these or even you comfort . 
i loved my first pair of these shoes . 
it s more  natural  than many of its competitors ,  it contains peppermint oil ,  cinnamon ,  blah ,  blah . 
i really wanted a toy steering wheel that was an infant toy . 
oh ,  and it s also made a place where they don t make peanut products . 
i had thought as it had said that it was built to be sturdy  ,  but its not . 
they have made a wonderful ,  irreplaceable breakfast bar ,  or snack for the car . 
but my son got ahold of it today . 
i have some that i consider pretty close to perfect . 
oh well i might buy a different shade next time ?  . 
i am sure this is a hit or miss product depending on your dog . 
my toddler received it for christmas and has only played with it twice num_num months later . 
the product arrivedwithout an inner seal and an outside screw on lid without a seal . 
the game starts off promising enough :  you fly around metropolis ,  and the city is gigantic . 
the tpu case was applying slight pressure on my phone buttons . 
my dad purchased this same bluetooth from the sprint store and paid close to $
there was a voice screaming in my head . 
it was way too oily for my dry skin . 
i have used way cheap irons at $ that performed better than this . 
the graphics look even worse online ,  and the whole system is not well designed . 
i read the description of the item and they did not send as described . 
unless you inject some extra opportunities to count your mice during the game ,  there s never any counting past  two  . 
after that all i could hear was static and nobody could hear me . 
one of them tore first time dog went through . 
i returned mine ,  as it just didn t fit well for my uke or mandolin . 
it appears the pump is no longer working well ,  probably due to a broken seal somewhere . 
i gave this game away since buying it because it was just collecting dust on my shelves . 
i am a fan of suikoden series i ,  ii ,  and iii but iv is a completely different game . 
this game is as boring as the television shows it was aped after . 
if the sides had adhered the same way the majority of it did ,  it would have been much better . 
i have to admit that i am probably jaded . 
it leaves a flat feeling in the mouth . 
i found this model on the web with good reviews about it . 
i purchased this stuff along with two other brands comprised of the same exact formula . 
we had to return this and get another present for the child . 
as i write this i have invested num_extend hrs . 
lulu ,  wakka and kimhari make their cameo appearances but contribute nothing to the story . 
i still dont get why shaving has to be so expensive . 
man ,  i was really wanting to play this game for a long time . 
they performed great until i tried to use the fm radio feature which was virtually worthless on both units . 
it was then i realized what was missing ,  it is the bergamot flavor . 
the smell was offensive to my nose ,  too perfumy . 
i would suggest if you purchase it make sure your dog is on the smaller side of it s recommendations . 
i was replacing a grinder that had given me many years of service with one issue ,  static . 
for the price of this speaker i would ve expected better . 
when you play ,  it takes num_num sec after you press the button for the action to respond . 
not sure but for what they cost one year is about all you going to get out of them . 
omega paw is hard to clean ,  and with litter robot you don t have to worry about that !  . 
when i found these i thought they were pillow pets just a little smaller version . 
i supposed i could bleach it ,  but i did better by purchasing the sistema mug . 
this is a real pain when it loses its network settings every time i reboot . 
texture is kind like slimy quinoa ,  but with an very bitter flavor profile . 
checked it against my american standard ,  mim strat and squier and it would not fit any of them . 
they didn t just pop right on ,  you had to really work them on . 
so far i am liking majority of the motions hair line products . 
i tried both lenses at the same time ,  and ended up sending the canon back . 
my one year old medium sized dog destuffed this toy in under three minutes .

i own this pan along with a huge set of this cookware . 
i figured the proof was in the tasting . 
i tried num_num different sets of batteries and made sure they were in correctly . 
let me just say that battery that came with are not compatible with iphone . 
we set this up this morning when our grandsons came over ,  and they were so excited . 
unfortunately ,  the writers expected us to know as well . 
i was looking for a basic timer with dial . 
i think the game is okay ,  but the second one is much better . blood rayneblood rayne num_extend
it is easily the slowest toaster i have ever used . 
their center bottom seam gets hairline cracks ,  then fails to vacumn . 
scientists say high fructose corn syrup is addictive as cocaine . 
nice that it s white ,  not black  who on earth likes a black kitchen ,  yecchhh  . 
i didn t think it s worth the trouble for the few dollars i paid so . 
i ignored the comment ,  but she was right ! it s not spoiled . 
it was a bit more shimmery than i had hoped . 
i have a love hate relationship with cereal ,  actually with all breakfast foods in general . 
western conference teams made alot of moves during the offseason and we can t play with the new teams . 
i have windows xp ,  but the installation program for the num_extend froze my computer . 
it gives one green light to show its working . 
i have contacted pcmicrostore about a refund or replacement through amazon ,  and i m waiting for their response . 
i didn t understand the problem ,  and at first blamed the receiver . 
somethime sound will play crystal clear ,  othertimes there s horrible distortion . 
it adds quite a bit of thickness to the iphone . 
but ,  wheels are plastic and slippery so that there is little grab on grass  only slightly better on carpet  . 
i also plan on contacting duralex as others have . 
i used the squeegee to get all the air bubbles out and that worked fabulously . 
i wear a small  size num_extend in most things . 
these are weak batteries and for bike lights don t use them . 
it is heavy and a bit of a chore to unravel and put away . 
i wouldn t touch this game until they ve released at least num_num patches . 
using that ,  netflix runs great on my num_extend with this cable ,  at least when the cable is working . 
however ,  it seemed like it had one too many scents trying to over power each other . 
but it looks pretty funky on me .  .  .  . not sexy at all . 
the box says supported os :  linux . so i bought it . 
it doesn t matter if you have three mouths or one ,  six arms or two . 
didn t expect to get a mat with small holes all throw the mat . 
the voice of this toy is so incredibly annoying . 
can t recommend at all !  !  !  !  :   used peanut butter as bait and nothing . 
please feed your dog twice per day . i do not feel this is a very good food for your dog . 
also not as cute as i thought it would be . 
i will send it to the salvation army . 
if that s good graphics ,  i ll pass on good graphics ,  thank you very much . 
it s a deep green plant . however at some point now decided to start cutting this with cheap rice flour . 
first one died at precisely the num_extend day of the num_num day warranty . 
i have the mens model but wanted a second one for a friend so i ordered this . 
it also created an unflattering shape to my breasts with a lack of support in the right areas . 
you have to really press hard to get a good amount of black on your lid . 
in doing so ,  two of the protective plastic circles again fell off as did one thin small wire clip . 
even if the product works somewhat ok ,  wait till you try to get spare parts from krups . 
made the screen look a little more hazier than i would have liked also . 
do some research and know what to expect as far as bacteria goes . 
the sparkly stuff on them cut her ankles and came off after the first wearing . 
i heard great things about this and wanted to see if it would work for me too . 
it was cheap ,  but i would expect to last a little longer . 
my $ slicer from the discount store did a much better job . 
i had just played the game num_num minutes before ,  turning it off to go make a phone call . 
very sad for the price and feel of these slippers . 
but most importantly ,  had extra lives for as long as you could drop coins into it . 
i will never order any philosophy products again . 
one earpiece just quit working all of a sudden . 
imagine now if those wire are behind a table . 
the cost of shipping and handling was $ bucks !  yep ,  the dirty rats had emplaced an electronic pickpocket . 
i would not recommend this collar if your dog has a bad barking problem . 
maybe do to me not reading exactly where it was being shipped from . 
they always turned the exact same color  same shade ,  etc  no matter what i ate . 
i didn t notice a difference in my skin at all . 
i found out that really don t get along with things with vetiver . 
however i think you ll find most skin care people do not recommend them . 
would not purchase again and would stick with single piece adapters . 
however after only num_num rounds down the barrel at the range ,  it was ready to fall out . 
it never seemed to make much of a difference . 
i have tried over num_num kinds of screen shields ranging from cheap ones to very expensive ones . 
the switch is cheap and difficult to work . 
interesting they rave about products from the same supplier . 
you can build literally only what is shown on the box and nothing more . 
i tried it as a wet shaver and i tried it with shaving cream but still got poor results . 
additionally ,  the button placement and button feel and action are not up to modern day standards . 
cleaner fluid did not clean my vinyl floor . 
the spring latch is easy and quick to open ,  close . 
from all the great reviews ,  i was expecting a unique product . 
the problem with this particular skirt was that it fit like a num_extend not even zip it . 
completely unusable . think i ll stick with items sold by  bling  and  amazon curated collection  . 
it s not pleasing like the thick ,  hot chocolate found in madrid . 
luckily i was able to trade it in for a new phone . 
the light was defective ,  a short somewhere within the switch mechanism . 
in all fairness getting the stain and smell out should probably take a lot of effort . 
called amazon and they immediately took the credited my credit card for the amount i paid for it . 
not recommended for those who grew up with the dippable kind of oreo cookies  that being most of us  . 
the smell ,  a combination of machine oil and plastic ,  is vile and possibly unhealthy . 
california ,  and it will not receive anything at all too . 
as soon as i tugged at them to see how strong they were ,  they ripped into holes . 
the stream seemed to go roughly num_num feet . 
it still smells and looks the same overall . 
it can be interesting in a certain sort of obsessive way for a while . 
i have two burmese cats who hate to be brushed . 
i never could quite get this protector to go onto the phone the way i wanted it to . 
i would give it num_num stars if i could . 
after five months the lights went out and it stopped working altogether . 
i ve used the mobile pro before and had good results as well as good ergonomics . 
bob s red mill usually makes such great products !  this flour has a very distinct unpleasant taste . 
the first one i got wouldn t hold zero and frequently turned off under recoil . 
there are regular ,  round ,  colored morsels representing the vegetable part of the mix . 
one of my cats pees against the sides and apparently the rim collects urine and leaks . 
i am surprised it didn t explode and kill me this thing is so awful . 
total choking hazard !  !  !  !  buyer beware !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  i only wish i could give this num_num stars . 
i ll probably buy again but if i do and there s no seal it will be the last time . 
well we know why ,  it doesn t function properly . 
i love the idea behind this ,  but it did not hold up well at all . 
it is made of two pieces of thin cheap plastic ,  riveted together ,  with no tension adjustment . 
it should pass intact into the large intestine but these don t seem to do that reliably . 
i ve had this less than a week and hardly used it .  .  .  . and now it s dead . 
this item that i have received is very poor quality . 
it also tastes like it smells which makes it completely undrinkable for me . 
they did not play with this for even num_num minutes . 
the commercial on tv is so cute but a big waste of money . 
this toy is okay ,  but i ve found the pet buddies version to be more durable . pet buddies num_extend plushy tube . 
people are just stupid ,  and sony knows this ,  so they are cashing in on the stupidity . 
that might sound adequate ,  but check the sizes of your towels . 
but zo is not the only ingredient in babo so there are few issues with babo formula . 
although i am pleased with the material i cannot wear thes pants because they are too tight . 
i really liked jedi academy but this game is not that great . 
i would not recommend this game to anyone . 
it only worked after about a dozen uses and then worked no more . 
this device is very uncomfortable ,  it actually hurts . 
it also seems to spontaneously bark and cry and wag its tale . 
i wanted to play this game ,  but the seller .  .  . hernando games and owner c . l . 
further ,  this needs watch batteries which will cost you more down the road to replace . 
any slight movement on my part made my ipod turn on or off . 
no good for a great white hot chocolate . 
when the thing stays together in one piece ,  it s effective . 
it needs a lighter roast to meld the flavors better . 
the toy we received didn t look like the plush toy in the photo . 
it was sort of a remake of num_extend from the original wolfenstein num_extend
i ended up having to youtube some so i could show my daughter how to do them . 
my fault ,  but i would not buy again or recommend . 
i have cable but wanted something to help with an antenna when and if i have cable problems . 
i own several other brushes and none have been this bad . 
and nothing about the construction of it would say it was sturdier than the original . 
n o t .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . unscented by no means ! it came dripping wet in the package too . 
if you are only the occasionally snorkeler while on vacation i suggest renting . 
i don t have pale skin ,  it s slightly tan . 
should also work for num_extend but that i don t own . 
i was disappointed and so was my kitty . 
why does it do this ?  i have no idea . 
this time all the cheese that came out had this grayish stuff on it that looked like grease . 
my cat was more interested in just having the ball to play with on the ground ,  haha . 
i was embarrassed to find out the helicopter did not work when the birthday recipient opened it up . 
really ?  well ,  why then does this stuff make me sick ?  . 
i have printed approxmately num_num or so picture in total . 
these things are all on the dollhouse itself . 
i thought this went into the litter box but the ferrets must ingest it . 
you would be better off with something else . 
i had to pay $ to return by ups . 
and i tried to use more and more flour ,  let it dry first . 
with all the reviews i thought this was going to be amazing . 
i put the razor away with a renewed respect . however ,  a few weeks later i needed to shave again . 
that is usually what i have with my tea and i have it twice a day . 
i really wanted to like this stuff after reading all the good reviews on it . 
but when you try to listen to num_extend or regular cds while walking ,  it skips alot . 
i recently had spinal surgery and need assistance with ordinary tasks such as sitting down on a toilet . 
after applying it other times it was short lived . 
dawgs usa really needs to reconsider this business decision . i would have tried the next size up . 
although their very last stateside generation of palmos devices was a notoriously shabby one in terms of build quality . 
unfortunately ,  i was one of those idiots who bought gamecube over num_extend
we received them on the num_extend of february and one died on the num_extend of march . 
superior . this is a very very basic heater ,  and it may turn you off of waxing due to the quality . 
kraft now makes organic mac and cheese and it s delicious ,  i m eating some right now . 
the amazon bag is larger and the sides are more rigid which makes it deeper . 
many questions were too vague ,  so the answers didn t go together . 
these panties were not only too little ,  but the material was too thin . 
i got an num_num and it actually works . 
add some adhesive velchro to the back of the case . 
if you want to brew two pots in a row ,  this will not work . 
it s more of a flashlight than a lamp . 
the part send does not support num_extend colt . 
it does not look like the picture either . 
the covers do not adjust well and they are difficult to seal once acetone is in place . 
these will be my emergency backup headphones i guess ,  but i doubt i ll use them . 
i have some young seedlings i ve been trying to protect from being dug up by armadillos and dogs . 
it takes a long time to figure out what is going on in the mirror . 
i took it to a bike shop and ended up just buying a different kind . 
i ordered this watch with several items that came in one box . 
i ve already baked at least half a dozen cakes in it ,  and not one has stuck . 
sometimes it even seemed to make me more oily . 
received this the day before i went out of town . 
this is why i give it num_num stars . 
i thought i d try this based on some lovely reviews ,  but sadly this wasn t for me . 
these gloves offer almost no wrist support ,  and i had to start using wraps to protect my wrists . 
someone was not packing based on weight that day . 
wow !  !  !  that will appeal to masses   if your a num_num year old girl   . 
was going to send it back and ran out of time . 
in fact ,  not only can toys be a hazard to animals ,  but so can many common household items . 
i watched the videos on youtube and had a few questions about everything this tape could do for me . 
this watch feels like it could break any moment ,  very fragile . 
i was hoping to like these ,  but they hurt way too much . 
i normally love revlon lip glosses but this particular one was just too pasty looking on me . 
it s possible that i just was shipped a bad unit . 
if you are buying this for an fnx num_num don t cheap out like i did and by this one . 
so one fifth of the box were just num_num different cards types . 
that is to say ,  jc fulfills every ending ,  and the world is shaped by that . 
on day one ,  he was gnawing it down and exposing the bristles for the first time . 
simply put ,  world s best cat litter stands head and shoulders above precious cat . 
when i first opened the container ,  the stench practically hit me in the face . 
also ,  the silicone picked up dirt ,  lint ,  hair ,  etc . 
i ll stick with my ardell brow powder from now on . 
i paid $ too much as used is under $ these days . 
i feel silly that i wasted my money on these . 
the main charger in the front held my phone at a great angle . 
there appear to be no official studies or research tests done on primal defense from independent labs . 
i used this thinking i wasn t going to see results over night ,  even though that s the claim . 
as of now ,  let me begin by stating that this mitten is extremely over priced . 
installation is not simple and the average diyer may have some issues . 
can t understand why you would send out something like this knowing young children would be doing these . 
i like to choose one that has a good sweet smell to it . 
after that though we had seen a lot of the questions and the game is very simple . 
basically you solve a mystery  the exciting part  . 
 still didn t do much to stop the sensor from turning the device on every few seconds . 
even though it has declination adjustment it s not dependable enough for legitimate use . 
the most important aspects of this unit ,  not so good . 
if you are not interested in vcd then add another star . 
it s only a measly num_num inches long . i can t comment on the accuracy ,  as i can t even mount it . 
however ,  the rate at which difficulty goes up is not matched by the money . 
naturally i already threw away the box and receipt so that s $ down the drain . 
oh nevermind ,  i used it once but it isn t a great jump rope at all . 
i bought this grinder after owning a $ blade grinder for some time . 
the micro usb doesn t fit snugly into my phone either; it s quite wiggly in fact . 
for me they do not provide good support and i will be replacing them after only about num_num months . 
i ordered these on the grounds that i needed a taller size . 
this happened to me several times . one problem that you will first notice with this game are the load screens . 
i will probably have to epoxy the brush to the body to keep it in place . 
i hope more purchasers will write additional reviews to let us know about the card damage problem . 
the main problem with this coffee is its aftertaste . 
it is sad to see that the u . s . 
the coverlets have adhesive completely around the sterile pad making it possible to really protect a wound from germs . 
for me ,  it is a bit weak and has an aftertaste . 
i study tea brewing with a tea master and so i am constantly trying different kettles . 
if i go slow enough ,  it ll cut the hairs . 
the blacks and reds are muted and dull . 
the majority of the background for ffvii is a muddy brown that looks sort of like mulch . 
if you are a plus sized woman ,  these are for you . 
infact ,  the power inverter cannot fill air into a new tyre . 
absolutely nothing like the picture they have of it on their light model . 
when the scrolls are finished the players then try to guess which one is their scroll . 
bought it num_num years ago and i did seldom use it .  .  . waist of money .  .  . tried to sell it ,  nobody want it . 
the original ghost recon for pc is hands down my favorite squad based num_extend shooter . 
i personally couldn t ever take the game s story seriously simply because of the character names . 
i m a wallet stuffer and i bought a wonderful one from macy s online store . 
i totally believe in open architecture for electronic devices . 
we have owned this for around three years and finally can t take it anymore . 
there is also a hint of onion flavor with some citric acid to give them a slightly sour taste . 
the kabuki was like dragging sandpaper across my face and smelled the worst of the lot . 
i returned these because they did not provide enough support for me . 
this foil cutter requires more effort  a stronger squeeze  than it really ought to ,  and too much turning . 
the lemon was mild ,  and i assume the sweetener was honey . 
buying this product was a waste of money . 
red ninja is a perfect example that has mechanics that are broken beyond reason or repair . 
the colorful environments ,  stimulating music ,  and inventive character design kept me interested even into recent years . 
for talking ,  i have to use the jawbone . 
i can t keep them white even with bleach and they are very thick . 
i spend most of my time on the playstation num_extend
the $ price was plain robbery !  it is dollar store quality . 
our it vendor ordered this for me num_num years ago  yes ,  the camera has been out that long . 
these  dryer balls  are just a way to bank on that old home remedy . 
after a few months ,  cable quit charging my wife s phone . 
my parents bought this for my son for christmas . 
stream is strong but not as fizzy as i would like . 
a couple needed help with their cat not using the litter box . 
my friends kept asking me to repeat myself . 
tried it a half a dozen times to no avail . 
i am not a moroccan fan of anything . 
there is nothing good about transformers the video game . 
i had no major issues with the quality of materials or workmanship . 
people who say  all platformers have camera problems !   have no idea what they re talking about . 
they are well worth the investment ,  but shipping is a problem here for amazon . 
i have used the mixer intermittently since then . 
i m using as directed ,  so i feel it s not that effective . 
it worked to replace our totally broken cord ,  but it got damaged quickly . 
the photo online gives the polish a smooth ,  glassy look . 
maybe i have spoiled her with rawhides that are easier for her to get . 
maybe it s just this one ,  but i wouldn t take a chance ! there are other vendors available . 
however ,  once i ordered from iherb . com it came with icepack and worked perfectly . 
it s not worth the $ bucks she paid for it . 
the camera is just as obtuse as everything else . 
over the years i have seen a bigger and bigger variety of personal lubricants on the market . 
people on the other side can not hear a word . 
i had to glue the rubber ends on as they constantly came off . 
alas performance did not measure up to its looks . 
for example ,  it emits a tone when you exceed num_num mph . 
the graphics are not very visually pleasing but the lighting affects were very nice . 
put the bulb in a flashlight to make sure the bulb was okay . 
most of the seventh generation items are recycled and if liquid or powder are earth friendly . 
sometimes it would work for a while ,  sometimes it would stop and start or garble the audio . 
you don t need a cooler ,  unless you can t put your num_num in an open area . 
i bought this kettle for a quick cup of hot chocolate the first kettle leaked from spout . 
however the curved long design at the end makes an even shave under the nose impossible . 
this is the worst headset i have ever owned . 
and now i have to go find another one .  .  . arrrghhh . 
i don t think the product is useful in any way . 
my straps were worn out and pinched my shoulders after about a year of steady use . 
i was so upset after my little girl opened this . 
i spent more time taking it out of the box ,  and putting it together . 
i would definately not recommend buying this ,  especially with the abundance of hard drive num_extend players avalable . 
killing kids and kids dressing up like you when you enter towns if you are num_extend
this is not red ,  nor is it close to red . 
i d have already ordered another pair but i m getting a little gunshy of buying stuff through the mail . 
unfortunately ,  neither one of them like it !  it has a really strong smell . 
unfortunately i will have to buy the expensive nutrilite but at least i know that works . 
my $ food processor can handle whole wheat bread better than this machine can . 
i put a disc in and a grinding noise would happen then it shot the tray back out . 
it does work with the black iphone num_num however . 
i got to use this num_num times and the stitching on the shoulder strap came apart . 
i was all pumped up about dreamcast s first baseball game . 
the game only comes with num_num sheets of cover page which runs out very quickly . 
spearmint is among my least favorite flavors ,  beating out only peppermint . 
i used eyelid primer and stay matte powder and it still transferred . 
in fact ,  they make me look bigger for some reason . 
the cuff isn t wide ,  but it s not tight against my leg either . 
i bought this for my kitten who feels the need to chew on everything and everybody . 
while the concept on this product is great ,  it didn t turn out to be what i expected . 
this case is not a tight fit and is loose on the sides . 
i returned them as soon as i tried one pair . 
but the the few times he has used it did not seem to work . 
when my eyes watered it came right off . 
i purchased one of these for myself and then another for my husband to use at work . 
therefore the cat has to use a dirty litter box unless it is emptied after every single use . 
so ,  as i said ,  i recently bought some more . 
i was eager to try the nivea num_extend skin firming body lotion due to past experiences with nivea products . 
their response was ,  thank you for the information ,  we ll make note of it . 
got back from the lake and the jetski is water spotted everywhere . 
i used bio spot for cats and for dogs ,  they didn t work at all . 
it would also much rather have breast milk from real life boobs ,  rather than this stuff . 
i would use the warranty if these weren t so new . its unfortunate because otherwise these are nice binoculars . 
i did not enjoy the taste all that much and regretted ordering a box of them . 
i installed the case and thought we had a winner .  .  . she loved it . 
this product did not work for me as a growth aid . 
i ordered my size and wide ,  but they were not wide at all . 
this is the best over the calf product i have tried for work use . 
it s the fourth cuisinart product i ve had that has done this . 
you spin the spinner and pick up a matching acorn . 
despite a cult following ,  the mech customization video game has lost its touch time and time again . 
i ve had one before ,  but a little bigger than this one . 
i did try a smaller size and it worked the same . 
it isn t really easy to brush and it is very rough and the roots of it look terrible . 
my dog tore this up and ate through it within the week . 
the hard plastic parts that attach to the soft cover are not strong enough . 
but it s still better than parts num_num and num_extend
well they look like starburst ,  but are much sweeter . 
schrade china review dropped a major bomb on that claim of the steel . 
when i contacted the seller about the problem ,  their response was to use the belt loops instead . 
when i researched large litter boxes this always came up . 
you can hear people through it but couldn t talk through it . 
i was disappointed because i expected better from motorola . 
i bought this hoping that a more expensive brand would make my hair softer and shiner . 
advertised to work with vista ,  but only works wired ,  or in g mode . 
maybe i had a lemon ,  it worked for about an hour ,  then it froze in the menu . 
i m sure they re selling that on here separately as well . 
i ve observed lots of mixed feelings for this game . 
i could not get this product to install correctly . 
my unit has never even moved off my desk since its purchase . 
only the lights on the hot tub work ,  and the toilet makes a flushing sound . 
the pellets were whole and compact with very little dust in the package . 
maybe i will remember and use on my hands after i wash dishes . 
there are not num_num job classes you can make your own however . 
this can cause a great deal of confusion . 
he doesn t just take one ,  turn it off ,  then see another  opportunity  and take another . 
it goes on greasy and i couldn t see a major difference with it on . 
this is the first honey i have ever tried that i didn t like . 
the perfume was so inexpensive that i thought to try it out . 
also it would not allow me to track its progress . 
metamucil clear and natural contains inulin ,  a natural veg . 
even the box  supposedly from apple  shows the phone slanted . 
plus you get one piece of grit on it and it will scratch your screen . 
etc . items in the game are all made by players ,  which is utterly ridiculous . 
i thought my one year old would be super into this ,  he loves sticking things into slots . 
i purchased num_num of these thinking i would add them behind my lcd and led wall mounted tv s . 
finally ,  my son doesn t really  play  with the case . 
it looked like someone had taken a knife and sliced right down the middle of the belt . 
the handle on this stick for this product also broke within num_num weeks ,  but my cats play hard . 
it is sweet enough for me because don t like sticky sweet tea . 
the snap closure works nicely ,  but the belt loop lacks any type of tactical disconnect . 
my num_num year old thinks it s neat ,  but doesn t understand how limited the learning possibilities are for him . 
i am extremely disappointed in the quality of this item . 
she gave me her happy purr when we returned to her regular stainless steel water dish . 
it is just a flimsy piece of steel stuck in an oxo handle . 
when combined with vitamin c and sodium bicarbonate  baking soda  ,  it forms benzene ,  a dangerous carcinogen . 
i would never go back to the thule or yakima stuff . 
once they arrived  after my son s party  we kept them in a treasure box for kids to play with . 
i am disappointed with how dark and how red the color is . 
the sound was fine ,  but the product quality was unimpressive . 
better look for a better product than this . 
it s relatively easy to get together the first time . 
i didn t really like these ,  they were kinda dull ,  and i got two and one was really dim . 
it s made from the more heat resistant ,  silicate compound that pyrex previously used . 
this will also be my review for every subsequent smackdown !  game . 
this toy lost our cats attention rather quickly . 
gee ,  i don t know why that didn t occur to me before we purchased them !  . 
note :  i was down to % and charged it while the phone was still powered on . 
the smell is really not that bad ,  but its not pleasant either . 
the record button is too close to the channel changer . 
seemed like it was glued with nail glue . 
if i did press the button i got a full pot . 
i am still around num_num lbs in weight and num_num ft plus tall . 
it snaps the dog s head to the side . 
we plan to add a num_num inch memory foam pad on top for its next use .   .  .  .   . 
i m just not sure what to do now . 
i am returning it to amazon and have learned a lesson about dealing with  unknown  companies . 
it is made of cheap plastic ,  and is not the most durable . 
i have fine long hair ,  that is fairly thick . 
the tournament is interesting ,  but once the ladder is climbed to the top ,  that s it . 
if you use this router for heavy traffic it will disconnect you constantly ,  both wired and wireless . 
nope ,  it s officially dead . i am very disappointed in this product . 
it takes a long time to get used to using the wheel and the foot pedals . 
that was the icing on the cake for us . 
maybe after five minutes ,  it will blossom into life ,  but my hopes aren t very high . 
my cable company give me this crappy router for free . 
you can drop your phone into place there is a button that holds your phone into place nicely . 
it was very loud ended up placing the receiver outside on the porch . 
is it something i like having in my kitchen ?  not really . 
i would never carry an animal in this crate again . 
this was a very cute toy .  . it lasted all of four days . 
fortunately i had used this kind of product before but my son who phone this was for had not . 
the cheaper stuff  porcelana  with hydroquinone worked far better for me . 
i ll have to keep looking for good ,  easy thai food . 
but that s not all you get out of the num_extend
shoes look beautiful . one problem ,  there is a bump inside the shoe ,  most pronounced in the right one . 
these binoculars definitely didnt help because they frustrated me constantly . 
this machine would work better with a roller type brush with firmer bristles . 
good looking ,  but rather inconvenient design that takes longer to access the cards . 
i read the negative reviews and thought they couldn t be that bad . 
i love the way these shoes make my feet and back feel . 
the company needs to do one thing with there product . 
i avoid it !  kellog ,  please don t use gmo for our kids . 
with those i had to take them out every once in a while and wipe the sweat off . 
i m back to using my cuisinart and braun blade grinders .  .  . and back to much better coffee . 
i will only order on amazon because this a no hassle website !  thank you amazon !  !  . 
the game runs level based ,  like usual ,  and gives you two options for players ,  ghost or niobe . 
i m a huge chocolate lover so i couldn t resist trying these . 
the combat chatter is fun ,  but you don t get to hear enemy in your cockpit in real life . 
old enough to remember  japanese junk   ?  .  .  . welcome to chinese junk . 
even after several washings ,  there are large black tufts of the pant material all over the house . 
mine worked ok the first year but not for all the trouble and expense to maintain . 
i worked in a kitchen for eight months . 
what a tremendous mess !  my cases ,  my equipment ,  and myself are covered in it when i m done . 
you also have all sorts of seafood and insect life . 
i wonder how much was paid for what are obviously fictional reviews . 
i have  rice bag  and this is quite ugly in my taste and quite stiff too . 
the only problem with this headset is that people you are talking to will have trouble hearing you . 
after reading all the reviews on these ,  i bought them . 
i threw away my old aluminum steamer because i am tying to eliminate all aluminum from my cookware . 
i bought these shoes for my water aerobics class . 
the machine does a great job cleaning but it s not been worth all the hassle . 
i just counted i have num_num outdoor fixed blade knives this one is my lest favorite . 
more blah ,  bland than i am used to in a decaf . 
i regret buying these ,  they re too thin and alternately too loose or too tight within the same pack . 
until today ,  the original ks ultra light ,  was a trusted product from a trusted site . 
we pay the price for corporate greed in more ways than one . 
it s fun ,  but after you have killed the same type of villian thousands of times ,  it s not fun . 
it is a decent design and is not a bad item and worth the price . 
a year passed ,  and for the most part ,  the toy sat in the toy box . 
i was so impressed i was attempting to order what i thought would be a similar driver . 
after i took off my sweats i still seen some residue on my clothing from this . 
i got a new pup and the washable pads stayed in place . 
i hate throwing out something i paid good money for . 
indicated that the bone was not for any dog with permanent teeth . 
i don t love the taste of it however . 
our family has liked every other flavored we have tried  bbq is the best  . 
i am surprised at all of the good reviews which i used when i selected these . 
personally ,  i would rather have a quiet fan . 
i do not feel anything with this line when fishes bite . 
either the signal is far too weak ,  or the modulation is insufficient . 
there is no comparison . the miu thermometer simply worked as thermometer should and the digital thing couldn t hold a reading . 
how good is the storyline ?  i ll tell you a bit and you judge for yourself . 
i finally went to the silver superstore on line . 
the flavors were not very distinct or fruity . 
however , the enclosed usb cable provided to recharge the batteries is not usable . 
the boxes were very cheap and looked like it wouldn t last . 
i have a large mutt who is a fairly fussy eater . 
shame on fisher price on not maintaining them ,  and having such a short service life for their products . 
i kept the paper in case amazon needs to contact me and take a look at it . 
however ,  i started to have headaches start creeping up within a few days . 
nothing came out; the onion was  too tough  for the wimpy grating slots . 
just like i figured ,  they don t stay around neck when i m working out . 
the point is to destroy other ships ,  preferably trading ships ,  and taking their cargo . 
most people don t expect great accuracy from a bb . 
i have thin ,  light hair ,  and would not recommend this product . 
they are too tight on top ,  so they hurt . 
if you are not a  one size fits all  type ,  beware . 
more examples outlining the differences between the two phones . 
its does not abborb the water as announced . 
it really makes your skin glow ,  but unfortunately for me it made my skin break out . 
one dog will not touch this at all and the other will eat half a portion . 
you can t have alexander the great spreading religious tolerance in the num_extend bc . 
he does not have wings and he does not make any noise or say any phrases . 
and it s not just a little loose ,  it literally slides off of my foot when i try to walk . 
every one has a different idea of what is good . 
i spend very little time at home and i never wear slippers outside . 
first ,  don t bother applying a snug fitting case . 
save yourself the trouble and buy a different wireless router . 
they look like in time they would break off . 
with the device ,  no connection at all . so ,  i returned the product to amazon . 
this is the first bluetooth headset that i bought . 
i usually buyclairol natural instincts ,  but i had a coupon for this garnier product . 
it s definitely more annoying ,  both to parents and children ,  than it is fun . 
this seems to work ok . finally ,  i paired with my apple imac ,  a desktop computer . 
it worked fine thru summer thunderstorm and tornado alerts in central florida . 
trust me sega fans ,  i do notice them . 
i could only get through half and bag and the whole lot went into the garbage . 
every scene looks washed out and out of focus . 
this tells me it is way too harsh for me . 
i received it on time ,  but it doesnt work . 
instead ,  it came with a small square strong magnet . 
luckily ,  the child receiving this as a christmas gift loved it . 
coffee ,  tea ,  and other hot drinks can be pretty subjective . 
i put them in the freezer overnight and .  .  . well .  .  . nothing . 
the second edition board had pictures of characters on each space . 
num_extend and my new mac mini running num_extend
i use the patch last fall on the tube for my road bike . 
second ,  eat at least % of what you weigh in kcal . 
the blade is too short to effectively cut anything but very small ,  dry items . 
as i began to pour it my mixing tin ,  it only got worse . 
i find it cumbersome to keep the lid open while scooping . 
this did not work on my bathroom sink . 
a cellular repair shop told me it was a hardware problem and that the wifi antenna had gone bad . 
i was getting poor accuracy and was frustrated . 
hello :  mac ,  samsung ,  communitcate !  !  my previous phone ,  the se num_extend synched its contact list flawlessly to my mac . 
since the first one was so new ,  i just returned it and got another . 
a clone copy of the two other games from last num_extend
no where on the battery or on the box i find the name  sony  . 
i got this box about num_num days ago and opened it last week . 
the ones i got are more like steaks ,  than small fish . 
i had one of these for my sprint htc evo and it worked great . 
get a better one .  .  . and try going to store and trying it out first . 
i would have been better served to buy a large bag of cotton balls for half the price . 
in every cut scene i watch ,  i cringe at the modeling done on niko ,  the main character s face . 
as a sorting toy ,  this isn t one to get . 
literally more than half the tube was empty . 
i was so thrilled to have a source for bulk crushed peppers . 
that is why it pays to do some research . 
we ll work with it but i ll be buying from somewhere else for sure in the future . 
the player is still sleeping in my closet . 
we did have this cake one week ago for a adult party . 
that is really really so irritating to me . 
i ordered a num_extend my normal us size . 
this brush seems to have less boar bristles then my brushes i bought in the num_extend
i got this item fast ,  i was highly impressed at how easy it was to install . 
for the price they are now asking you could find much better speakers for a little more cash . 
so having read other reviews ,  i probably should have known better than to take my chances with s . t . a . l . k . e . r . anyway . 
just don t do anything to intense with it ,  and you should be fine . 
i checked and the hole was clear of grounds . 
the tank hangs on the side of the pot all lopsided and really looks as tacky as all getout . 
it threw so many enemies at you that you were busy mashing buttons to stay alive . 
and to go a bit off topic and be honest i m not thrilled with amazon s return policy . 
this size was wrong and it was too difficult to get over my bijon s head . 
i needed to turn the car off and get needle nose pliers to get it out . 
i cannot imagine ,  however ,  that cat food could taste much worse than this stuff did . 
but the rope inside is too thick and makes it impossible for the dog to retrieve the treats . 
this sampler  with free shipping  is probably your best bet . 
the entire unit is a single molded piece ,  so nothing is adjustable . 
she chewed a num_extend inch piece off of the circular side . 
there was no change so i will be trying collagen with vitamin c . 
so for comparisons sake did not want to jazz this up with it . 
this has little if any creative play possibilites . 
i m not fond of their mascara but their lipstick  semi permanent kind  is affordable and decent . 
much smaller then it appears in the picture and bleeds colors everywhere . 
if i had checked the warranty beforehand ,  i never would have bought this . 
these are ok ,  but difficult to apply correctly . 
five minutes later i started getting messy  dots  . 
in general double edge razors are not well designed . 
will only keep you play for num_extend and that was it because there is not that many options . 
it s really easy at first but as you blow through the enemies ,  it makes them harder . 
the white plastic box has cheap tabs to secure its closure . 
store because it claimed to reduce the under eye puffiness and dark circles . 
the idea of it sounded great but it s not . 
it falls apart if you so much as bump it and she enjoys moving toys from room to room . 
this is a lousy accessory that breaks almost as soon as you buy it . 
but it s not one of the enjoyable dishes . 
the watch itself is perfect ,  but the strap is useless . 
i was hoping to save some money and decided to try this one . 
unless i ventilate the room like crazy ,  i end up feeling nauseas ,  with a headache . 
i tried replacing the soil and gravel that it was excavating . 
however ,  i could never get it set so that i got a proper feed . 
like the other mouse ,  it tried to free itself . 
when i bought these speakers i was very ,  very pleased with the quality of sound and the sleak design . 
really thought that it would not be gmo ,  like so many other of their great products . 
but among the three flavors i tried ,  the watermelon strawberry was my least favorite . 
however the hooks were too small ,  and not flexible . 
that is ,  before we had to remove the stuffing and squeaker from his mouth . 
but the trade off just isn t worth it in my opinion . 
as is pointed out in a number of reviews these are incredibly poorly made . 
they don t seem to be exceptionally well cushioned . 
phone said it was charging but computer was never able to connect . 
i am very disappointed at the low flow rate . 
not a bad case just not well made . 
received this nail grinder and was immediately taken aback by how loud the thing was as was my dog . 
this was a big waste of money for me ,  . 
as almost an aside ,  i started with a hack saw ,  and realized that the pin is very soft . 
short of assuming it s a manufacturing defect ,  it seems that this headset just isn t what it could be . 
i like champion double dry much better ,  shape wise . this one is not good for running . 
it s like whatever coating was on the back to repel is gone and now attracts everything . 
there is potential for injury to your kitties using this . 
flimsy ,  loose ,  cheap ,  ugly and not worth a dime . 
if it were not a gift ,  i would have taken it back . 
while the design is good ,  the screen allows small splatters to go through the mesh . 
do not give lavender oil to boys it will cause a hormone imbalance and will cause breast enlargement . 
not sure how safe it is to swallow peaces of blue plastic ,  but i took the toy away . 
it just seems to fall flat and be pretty uninteresting to play . 
got a new one from boscov s and it was only $ is slim and stylish and works great . 
the packaging is so poor that the cans arive dented as did the replacement shipment . 
otherwise ,  ill conceived . one thing this gauge would be really good for :  a design school case study . 
no one has any clue what ,  if any ,  adulterants are added . 
the only thing i fail to see is the what all the fuss was about . does it shave ?  sure . 
instead ,  it just sort of spurted and dribbled . 
this is the only one that cuts in and out and makes screeching noises . 
the brushed metal obscures fingerprints yet it s relatively easy to clean . 
the bristles are not in the right position to tease your hair ,  very disappointed in this product . 
i still use that with my home made hatchery . 
soybean meal is a poor quality protein filler . 
in the land of fable ,  jamaica apparently lies just off the coast . 
he runs and catches pretty hard on this ,  the spring on the end is still functional . 
reading the ingredients list ,  i was surprised to see just how  unnatural  this stuff really is . 
i ve tried a few mio flavors ,  and this is my least favorite . 
if you have extremely sensitive skin and can find no other sunscreen ,  you might want to try this product . 
i used it and saw that it draws fleas to your pet and then sterilizes them ,  not kill them . 
if you re not asleep now ,  you will be once you ve played this thing . 
as a brush ,  it simply does not work on his hair . 
there is no flavor in this coffee that bears any resemblance to creme brulee . 
and the tag reader worked fine on every one as well . 
i ve uploaded some photos of my kit . the apparent quality of all the items is very poor . 
as others have said ,  the black matte finish wears off rather easily ,  exposing the white plastic underneath . 
when i first found the set ,  i couldn t afford them . 
i did drop my phone a few times and the case did protect it . 
the  yes  and  no  options are at the bottom of screen . 
everything rattles around inside of this case providing no real protection . 
my cat was not happy !  we have a larger cat and this is way to small for him . 
the instructions say to use a dime size dollop on wet or dry hair . 
it appears to work as well as can be expected . 
this product is a total waste of money . 
so ,  i will stick with herbal essense . buy this product lottabody at your own risk . 
it barely latches and offers little protection to anything except the lantern globe . 
to be blunt ,  this game sucks balls !  the weapons are awful and the graphics are ok . 
on the num_extend day  really ,  i m not kidding  it developed a whistle on the lowest setting . 
however ,  the fragrance is spicy and kind of gross ,  so i don t recommend it for either gender . 
after about num_num days the head that plugs into the cigarette lighter actually broke apart . 
it s way off !  said the specific gravity was num_extend when it was actually a extreme low num_extend
i can t believe it took a little over a year ,  but it no longer has any suction . 
but they don t pull at the hairs so that is not it . 
there was no gooey texture ,  as promised ,  and even after adding the remaining powder ,  there was still no goo . 
i will not order biosilk from this particular vendor again . 
but then you plug in your headphones ,  and the volume drops way down . 
i knew my back would give me problems wearing a shoe like that so i returned them . 
they also made me feel a bit light headed . 
also ,  the band around my chest was too big . 
the ratchet resistance on this holder just doesn t seem to be there at all . 
i am tired of seeing organic snacks with sugar as highest number in nutrition description . 
in other words ,  despite the epic beauty of the music ,  it s just bland and pointless to me . 
but frankly you might be better off just saving your own candy wrappers and creating your own kit . 
the small booklet has num_num double pages of clear and simple instructions . 
as soon as i walked out the store , the reception went static beyond belief . 
the problem with it is its just plain cheap . 
will return if it s not too much of a hassle . 
it looks really nice in the photos ,  but in real life it is rather cheap . 
i have to contact the company during business hours to work something out ,  hopefully a replacement balloon that works . 
added it to my wishlist and received it for christmas  shipped from amazon  . 
the taste is ok but i don t think they taste like s mores . 
this game was released about num_num and developed over the num_num years prior to that . 
i had a device that gave a low battery indication ,  so i got one of these batteries to replace . 
i couldn t tell that this product did anything to change my biological processes . 
it can not record on even fuji disks . 
don t know what happened but now it s in the trash . 
it has a very oily taste to it . 
if that were the rule ,  you would see almost no positive reviews for these new maxtor drives . 
i felt bad for giving this to my daughter . 
it made me wheeze and sneeze; not for me mike !  !  . 
there is even some good character development ,  not a lot for the npcs ,  but still some . 
half the flag was already worn off when i got it . 
shame on ubisoft for allowing this garbage out on store shelves !  . 
i didnt buy this game this year however i borrowed it . 
i didn t think that was a bad price until i received the bags and felt how cheap they are . 
don t believe me ?  go ahead and waste your money and see for yourself afterwards . 
there is a war going on  .  .  . and i m not talking about the ongoing iraq struggle . 
it worked flawlessly for num_num days  about num_num year ,  num_num months  . 
this game was okay i get tired of the samething over and over again . 
the graphics are bright vibrant colours ,  which are quite fun . 
i ve been detailing and cleaning my vehicles for the past num_num years . 
i always do a good cleaning on it when i grind that much . 
this item was probably not genuine samsung but more likely a knockoff . 
the last email i sent was num_num days ago and i have received no response . 
they taste good though ,  and maybe it s just a side effect on me . 
i was expecting these to be the same ,  but maybe with a little different taste . 
storage is a definite problem with this oven . 
it was a great game when i first bought it . 
thought these would be like shoo  n see targets with high visibility after being shot . 
sturdy ,  impact absorbant ,  and it makes the phone look pretty cool . the otterbox sucks . 
it will launch classic applications ,  but there are many issues with older fonts . 
dont even bother spending ur dollar on it lmao you will never use it ,  its so hideous . 
my family and i are super smash bros . 
i didn t want to waste anymore time with this . 
i am very frusterated because i really want to love this product . 
it started with squeals ,  giggling ,  riotous laughter and a big blue tub . 
if any way to return please let me know i ll put it to five stars . 
this product has ruined at least num_num perfect home manicures i did . 
the pieces were so small that it was hard to identified the items . 
 this same size cost $ on sephora s website  . 
if you start to having leaking issues claim your warranty !  !  !  !  don t let it go . 
i use this spray on top of the brushing so it gets rid of his bad breath instantly . 
the flavor is the same ,  but the texture is now unpalatable . 
there isn t much to tuck in and they won t stay tucked for any length of time . 
it might be fun to drive around the cars but they are always turning upside down ,  etc . 
it would make it much appealing to use . 
if i lost it ,  i d buy something else next time . 
you get what you pay for in this instance . 
and no ,  i do not have extra sensitive num_extend
ever heard of quality control ?  two thumbs down . 
throughout the day ,  the odor kept becoming stronger and stronger . 
however ,  the cable far outweighs the phone itself which makes the phone hard to use . 
i was expecting a lot more from these . 
even my mother who knows nothing about photography and lenses noticed it . 
my daughter had been hounding me for this for months so i purchased it for her for xmas . 
unnecessary equipment for ipod touch num_extend unless your fingers are gigantic . 
you have to press really hard to hear a heartbeat . 
the steamfast works good but a good working product is only good if replacement parts can be easily found . 
i found another that is just as effective and safe and goes on smoother because it contains olive oil . 
had to return them ,  don t think i will try another size . 
in short ,  stick with leadfoot or dtrsc and you will be at least $ better off . jc . 
everything works fine on that box ,  too ,  except for the wireless part . 
the product that was sent to me was wrong ,  didn t even look like the picture at all . 
so ,  i figured i could still consume what was left in the bag itself  which was % left inside . 
no doubt this pillow serves it s purpose ,  but i just could not get used to it . 
for some reason ,  the handle was wrapped separately from the pot . 
the programming work done by titus is stunning indeed . 
i will have to hook my online up to try it someday when i have time . 
i m unsure if i ll even bother putting it back out . 
the channel provided for the cover is very small and is evidently application specific . 
if the bunny hops ,  the player gets to keep it . 
this shaver is a dual power ,  with option to use either batteries or adapter . 
or an espresso cup which has num_num mg . 
players will also portal block you which will force you into one of their other ambushes . 
we had purchased this toy gumball machine for my son s birthday . 
i wouldn t buy this if you want a quality one . 
i thought i would end up breaking the little hard plastic tabs . 
i bought num_num packs for me and my sister to have . 
maybe it s because my insomnia had a different cause than the other people who wrote reviews ?  . 
this is a harsh scrub that i don t think anyone should use on their face . 
this will do nicely until they are old enough to be able to deal with china . 
i bought tons of card sets and this pen . 
i still do have problems with att ,  but not as many . gps :  broken . 
the litter continued to be tracked through the house despite keeping this carpet clean . 
i purchased this for my one year old dog . 
he won t even pick it up ,  let alone play with it . 
in my opinion in your house is more fun to play than this . 
slow and annoying . you can t pick the gender of your petz . you can also have your petz run around the desktop . 
each time ,  the algae comes back in a few days . 
this is not a bad product but it did not agree with me personally . 
seems like the pieces don t fit together as tightly as they perhaps should . 
i have a very high tolerance for pain but this broke all barriers . 
i don t think any of it tasted good at all . 
yes ,  they are cheap and yes ,  there are several in the pack . 
even if i blow hard into it ,  and when i change the depth setting on it . 
that s just disgusting and perverse and if mr . 
it s all academic though ,  since this blade will occupy my junk drawer until needed for a nasty job . 
forget weaker stations . fm is better with more reasonable sensitivity and selectivity . 
it seems to do it on its own . 
bad decision . i knew there was a problem when i opened the bag and the coffee smelled burnt . 
i don t wear tiny underwear ,  but there s enough fabric in these for two pair ,  going on three . 
i don t think there s anything special about argan oil over any other oil  for effects on the hair  . 
another complaint i have in this area is the flying around in your airplane . 
doesn t really do what it is supposed to . 
not as much of a bubble and i expected . 
on the other hand ,  the pouch it came in was neat and my puppies love to play with it !  !  . 
bad taste it has ,  but i can usually get around most supplements that are not tasteful . 
multiply this stressful effort times num_num pumps and i can finally get num_extend
i changed my cleanser ,  toner ,  moisturizer ,  exfoliant ,  serum ,  etc . 
it s greasy ,  oily ,  and if it worked ,  i d deal with it ,  but it does nothing . 
just a bit messy but do the job . 
the crepe was brown in the center and raw on the outside . now ,  i ve used this for deep dish pizza . 
the zooming mechanism is noisy and appears cheap . 
molybdenum is expensive and is getting more scarce . 
however ,  it is not shock as shock absorbing as i need . 
i used this product once and it did not do as promised . 
my num_num month old cat doesn t understand this toy . 
she thought she could put clothes in the baby changer and was disappointed when she wasn t able to . 
and strange enough ,  the other different color caps from this maker did fit fine . 
i highly recommend lexar for reliability ,  speed ,  and lower power consumption . 
i was unable to make that go away . 
sometimes the cover comes out while keeping and removing from jeans pockets . 
the ballerina stands on a long silver spring ,  which looks very odd . 
but it doesn t even say if it s determinate or indeterminate ,  much less other important details like disease resistance . 
however .  .  . the enemy rarely has just one type of unit ,  in fact it usually has a pretty well rounded force . 
basically i could memorize the dictionary before i memorize goku s kamehameha . of course ,  the game will get num_extend stars . 
my son loved the game the first num_num times he played it ,  but he has already lost interest . 
this is a useless ,  $ piece of garbage and logitech should be ashamed . 
i noticed on the griffin technology website that range is not on the faq . 
even if it cost a buck or two more ,  nobody would notice . 
the only ones who did eat it was my three num_num months old kittens . 
not any brighter than the set that was in there .  .  . just the cheapo kragen brand . 
this camera disappoints on a number of levels . 
just a frustrating thing . the biggest gripe i have with this game is just the simple menu navigation . 
anyway ,  i m putting up with it for now but expect to be buying another one in about a year . 
u apply the rubber casing then the plastic casing . 
it is not innovative ,  in my mind ,  and not interesting . 
it is an awesome series and in some ways i like it much better than num_extend
i had it for a month when it just died on me . 
it is comfortable under the breast area as well . 
mine tore at one of the seams the same day i received it . 
received this item yesterday .  .  .  .  .  .  . i must have received a bootleg version of the product . 
iv tried hanging it ,  placing on my bed   witch defeats the porpoise of wilrless  on the dresser . 
bought this for mom ,  but upon seeing it in its plastic sleeve ,  i knew she won t like it . 
one by one ,  all of the discs went bad within a num_num months period . 
the product might have been fine to use if the color worked for you ,  but it didn t for me . 
trust me ,  you won t be sorry you waited . 
and do not screw it too tight or you will never get it apart again ,  esp . 
never ever ever let this splash onto your skin . 
seat is usually way too tight or too baggy  as is the fit  ,  inseam is always way too long . 
it is very comfortable ,  just not sized right . 
this is crazy !  a total waist of money . 
but i own other cosmetics that are the same price that do not contain these harmful chemicals . 
not true !  this made a terrible mushy mess . 
it is the noodles in a soup form of cheese . 
i ve had other handhelds in the past with much better reception . 
the engine hood has a very small clip lock to keep it shut . 
the num_extend is a keeper ,  this netgear ,  no . 
it was fun the two times that we played ,  but on the third time ,  the motor wouldn t start . 
i get tired and bored of the same old dark environments every other minute . 
i have purchased riding boots from ariat for many friends . 
but the hooks aren t nearly long enough to hook over the top and have the net submerged . 
this appears to be a common issue with all sony s current vertical headphones . 
the case also makes it hard to press the volume button . 
i m sticking to my l oreal telescopic mascara in carbon black . 
if you are a playstation num_num owner i d recomend socom :  us navy seals over rainbow six . 
i am running a num_extend num_num which is well within the system requirements . 
this is a great product for my laptop and i use one all the time . 
the seam dividing the lace top from the satiny bottom falls at a very strange place ,  too high . 
i bought these to remove some of the wrinkles in my jeans but they did nothing for the wrinkles . 
by this i mean ,  your roleplaying doesn t change the story too significantly . 
not sure it has done any good for me . 
it made my screen look cloudy and dirty the minute i put it on . 
my oldest wore this costume num_extend years old  . 
i didn t like it very much at all ,  so got a hard plastic case which was much better . 
but these seem all too much like their cheaper competitors :  basically just bits of plastic film . 
if the unit was working as designed i would have great concern for the longevity of the battery holders . 
we got a calming collar for blue and found that helped more . 
this device lacks robustness needed for the job as advertized . 
i always read reviews before buying a product but i didn t have time . 
i could leave it out for days before they touch it . 
if you re looking for a  floor duster  buy it . 
even the crystals are lighter in comparison to the other product that i was drinking . 
unreal tournament num_num is a misnomer because there s absolutely no tournament involved . 
link looks and talks like a complete loser . 
my expectations were low but this plastic case looks like it came out of a vending machine . 
no exp ,  cool items ,  secret endings ,  or anything interesting like that . 
beware of all the positive num_num star reviews allegedly written by the manufacturer and their allegedly paid associates . 
never been so disappointed in a seidio product . 
i m just kidding with the title of this review . 
i will no longer buy this product due to the toxic ingredients . 
do not wear it on a belt ,  keep this sheath away from public eyes  : dstandard china made cheap product . 
first of all ,  it s not possible to record one program while watching another . 
as for ingredients ,  it seemed to have all the vitamins associated with energy boost ,  though it also contained caffeine . 
both still work like new ,  although the coiled wire protecting the cord has rusted a bit . 
the screen guard had lots of scratches as if it was taken out of the box many times . 
i love it ,  but it deserves the following spanking . 
for me that was the straw that broke the camel s back . 
my guess is that the internal wires are not connected at the right spots in the plugs . 
this is my fault for not having read the reviews before buying this thing . 
with hindsight ,  scooping litter once or twice a day isn t so bad . 
tried to give no stars ,  but i guess you can t . 
i don t think that this product caused more acne; i blame the heat and humidity . 
it s made long on the bottom and keeps rolling up under my breasts . 
that s about the only good thing i can say about it . it tracks . 
i purchases this as i liked how low profile it seemed . 
but when i tried to dislodge the grounds from the bottom with a light tap ,  the carafe shattered . 
as much as i love burt s products ,  this one might should be skipped . 
cute toy but our bulldog crushed the squeakers up on the inside quickly without even tearing the outside . 
but when attempting to scoop up clumped urine ,  it falls apart so easily . 
we called kitchen aid and they said it s out of warranty and cannot be repaired . 
i heard some dogs eat them like treats . 
it s amazing how much whiter they make your teeth after only a few days . 
this has led to unpleasant side effects such as her throwing up ,  passing gas ,  having diarrhea ,  etc . 
i was anxious to try this item because i hoped the ginger would help quell my morning sickness . 
i had this case on iphone num_extend for nearly a year . 
how hard is it to make the game easier . 
i could have bought them num_num circular ones for the same price !  . 
i ve played video games my whole life and i would rather play pong than this waste of space . 
should have known there s no such thing as a  bargain .   . 
i should have went with that product instead of  settling  based on price . 
some of pink tops cracks during first use . 
the characters are about as boring as they come . 
i get a blue screen in vista ,  or xp about num_num minutes of configuring . 
i have a westie and a cockerpoo ,  in other words not big dogs . 
problem is ,  i had to try dozens of times before a combo would execute . 
we had this toy for approximately one afternoon before my num_extend
pgr tried to do both with allowing you to pull off moves ,  but did it poorly . 
however ,  neither windows update nor the usrobotics site have drivers for it . 
i suspect it may entertain a child under num_extend but that s about it . 
this morning i woke up and for some odd reason my scalp was itching . 
i have never had a problem with acne and bought this to minimize my pores . 
this worked well for the application but the batteries just kept on dieing in the remote . 
seriously ,  this game is not nearly as entertaining as double dragon on the super nintendo . 
these belts do not fit this model !  !  !  even after bringing this to amazon s attention ,  this  suggestion  still remains . 
don t buy this game unless you have a lot money to waste . 
the game crashes tot he desktop every now and then . 
although i love the nana s brownie mint ,  and peanut butter flavor cookies ,  i found the ginger cookie disappointing . 
but ,  like another reviewer ,  my face started to break out ,  especially along my hairline . 
 my tap water is totally soft ,  but comes out of the tap at ph of about num_extend
where peach can hover an luigi jumps all high . 
the connection between the rotors and the powerful motor are all flimsy plastic and break easily . 
i kept the knife but dumped the bf . 
this was a stupid purchase on my part and just not worth it at all . 
i sleep during the day so i put it on prior to going to sleep  no odor ,  no sweating  . 
unlike many other mmo s you just can t walk over to where you please like in a real persistent world . 
and i tried so very very hard to like it . 
it smells like i ve been hiding in a nursing home for weeks if i put this on my skin . 
as i walked closer ,  two rabbits jumped from the echinacea and hopped across the yard . 
i do like the liquid version in the pump . 
on no setting could i get rid of . 
at least they don t slide down into my shoe . 
i just applied this product as directed for the first time on a clean ,  washed face . 
a study found that preterm infants fed dha had better developmental outcomes ,  but not the toddlers . 
the shave is comparable in closeness to a gillette good news !  disposable . durability :  num_num star . 
not one thing stated on the tube happened to my skin . 
one would think it would not being cast iron . 
it always happens that his house is the last you look at . 
my friend gave me this kitchenaid a year ago and it doesn t chop anything in consistant pieces . 
i am coming from a hard tail seat which on my mountain bike . 
as it turns out ,  they are sugar and sesame . 
this game gets real boaring after awhile so this is an okay game . 
a tens unit set to burst can give you an amazing massage for cheaper than this is . 
naked has the lightest taste and some like the subtle flavor . 
it s a good attempt that needs to be reworked . 
in fact ,  it made the stain yellow and it smelled like a bottle of rubbing alcohol . 
unless you re an expert ,  steer clear of the num_num radeon pro agp num_num mb . 
see product images . final opinion :  a waste of money unless you have some way to support it . 
i will admit that the unit did work before it failed . 
but i wanted to give a shout out to grady s online customer service . 
the shutter stays open for so long that unless you are completely motionless ,  your pictures are blurred . 
the wooden  gray  inserts on the side are not fixed in place . 
pick up the original deus ex if you like games of the genre; let this  sleeper hit  continue sleeping . p . s . 
it provided decent support for my num_extend girls and it was fairly comfortable ,  but something was just off . 
i spent the good part of the evening trying everything to get this sucker to work . 
of course it doesn t help either that both the armors suck . 
i could tell that this would turn into serious pain and irritation during a long run . 
some wouldn t even pay attention to me when i held it out . 
every city has   insert name  crab  ,    insert name  worm  ,    insert name  fly  that all look the same . 
first and foremost let s cover taste :  it tastes just fine . 
i wish i had just bought more games for his leapster . 
which is a problem when you re using a cafetiere that requires a decent amount of ground coffee . 
the best of other white beans i ve had cook up wonderfully creamy and flavorful . 
however ,  it was a good simulation of cultural development . 
my old hg thermometer has the typical printing on the glass . 
this happened even after i upgraded the firmware  :   . 
halo is a much better game !  i started with azurik ,  and it ws fun . 
 oh ,  no !   don t buy  em ,  no matter how pretty they are . 
i keep thinking of green army duffle bags but let s face it . 
when i touched her skin ,  tiny flakes of glasses got attached to my skin too . 
but upon applying the case the plastic piece doesn t fit and keeps falling off . 
i tried to look for drivers and there are none to speak of . 
on the product description page ,  it looked like aa batteries were shown in the image . 
for that it gets an extra star . i d give this four stars at num_extend and five at num_extend
i didn t expect much and that is what i got . 
the lids on a couple of the compartments will no longer stay closed . 
tried getting large i weight num_num lbs  but still too short ,  pinch toes and fall down . 
it looked sturdy and looked like its made of high quality foam . 
update :  i just didn t like how the phone sat in the base . 
wow ,  my hair is dark brown now ,  and forget the dimensions ,  i ll need to do the highlighting asap . 
unfortunately ,  i had to return the product as it was defective . 
this case looks really nice on my white iphone num_extend but thats about it . 
most irritatingly ,  though ,  is that it doesn t have a set knob ,  even for the analog hands . 
thank goodness the postal worker found a tissue type envelope to send the product back . 
a couple of months ago i started having restart problems with the filter . 
if you like changing your bands often ,  look elsewhere . 
i then have num_num days to send the other one back . 
still ,  there a few details that need to be mentioned . 
i usually use num_extend tourmaline straightenerbecause it is highly recommended by stylists for its protective properties . 
these i didn t care for because of the texture . 
i can say ,  i saw them on sale locally ,  too . 
this was my first time ordering anything from here . 
the description was incorrect and the product did not match my device . 
so i have fine thick straight hair that has recently become dry on the ends . 
i was also expecting a much quicker response from this unit . 
i did not like the way it smelled on me . 
the purple dress is basically light purple with a darker purple top ,  and white trim . 
on about my fourth use of the krups machine ,  the blade cracked ,  which makes the process even more laborious . 
this seems to happen to me a lot . 
the fabric is loose ,  however the elastic leg bands are tight and uncomfortable . the chamois is also sized weird . 
now i know why i received only one of these instead of the   pack of num_extend as described . 
i took num_num bites and couldn t eat anymore . 
it helps some but it s not the magic bullet the oil i bought from them before was . 
i just purchased a glass top stove and bought this because of the protective bottom . 
i can not recommend these for flat bar bikes . 
wow k walked num_num miles in the short time ?  not likely . 
i am not happy with it but cannot return it after washing it . 
this waffle maker is definitely not for morning waffles . 
got if for wifes car ,  she has an iphone num_extend
after one tumble on ceramic tile the timer still worked but the alarm was broken so it s mostly useless . 
you must also buy patio blocks or some sort of weighted devices to keep it in place . 
no go !  if you dont know what i m talking about ,  read more reviews about routers on amazon . 
unless you are specifically looking to fill your trash bin ,  don t buy this item . 
nada ,  zip ,  nothing !  i am now going to purchase a buffer and see if that helps . 
i took the plunge and used some holiday cash that i had and bought these earbuds . 
i m not sure why it tastes so bad . 
they do not stay on the bathtub walls ,  just slide right off . 
i cannot specifically say this was the culprit . 
another negative is that it took a very long time to brew a pot . 
this model is very limited to what you can see on the display . 
i recently sold it at a yard sale . 
i started doing a little research and found that wheat products are very allergenic to dogs . 
which is fine if thats what you want ,  but i wanted tortillas . 
and letting it steep for longer didn t help either . 
cato gets excited when you put a collar on him  expecting a walk  ,  and this collar was no exception . 
i bought this collection about a year and a half ago and am left with the two spoons . 
because of the weakness of this game ,  the only positive is that the game is so short . 
i bough this back on march num_extend num_extend
i know energizer makes some great products but i would not recommend their rechargeable batteries . 
the tackiness of the plastic strips probably got affected because they don t seem to stick very well . 
i suggest you rent the game before you see if you can look past all these cons . 
only used warm cycles and never put into dryer ,  only hung out to dry . 
this toy is not only hazaderous ,  but it is a hunk of junk . 
i doubt i will order this again since i ve found other mascaras that perform better . 
i bought this for myself and my mom because it was cheap . 
this latter has nothing to do with my ability to configure the unit . 
disappointing for my son and a hassle for me . 
this case was discolored very quick just from normal use . 
unfortunately this one strength is not enough to bring this game to life it still is fair . 
i just don t feel this is worth the buy at $ shipping  every time you need a replacement . 
they ve changed the design ,  the shoe is more pointed and it is just too tight in the front . 
not too loose that the phone shakes around . 
at num_num bucks it s not a bad deal . 
it is not a bad quality but unfortunately the colors are not right . 
i am an it professional with num_num years experience . 
etc  and this did nothing but make my hair feel like it was three days past a wash . 
after using it for a few weeks ,  there was no difference in my skin tone ,  texture ,  or anything . 
one handle broke less than ten days after we got it . 
after megaman num_extend however ,  capcom has been getting sloppy with the series . 
they continued playing in and on it every day . 
he runs away from this because of the odor . 
however ,  i can tell you i didn t like the taste . 
i noticed ,  however ,  that their latest products are absolutely unreliable and poorly built . quickcam orbit is the latest example . 
this was not nintendo brand as the listing states ,  amazon should have quality control on this stuff . 
i think for that reason it is way over priced . 
i will not purchase another one of these but look for something more durable . 
the linksys routers would not talk to each other or assign ip addresses properly . 
for anyone with high frequency hearing loss this timer is useless . 
this is the first time i haven t liked a microwave popcorn flavor . 
when you tilt your camera down ,  it moves . 
i was surprised because quite frankly all the other linksys hardware i have work great . 
sunshine polishing cloth is the absolute best i have ever used . 
so i expected something really good from melitta s hazelnut flavored . 
the smaller head gets into areas a larger head cannot . i will go back to the traditional head . 
the spoon would be grated and could leave bits of plastic or wood behind . 
if food has spoiled ,  no they will not eat it . 
get something stronger ,  you definitely get what you pay for . 
i wish i could say that these are awesome but i couldn t even get them on . 
i thought this would be similar to morrocco methods zen detox . 
my energy level was about the same while using the product as without it . 
there is a very odd smell to this food ,  it almost smells as if it is bad . 
i would not recommend it to anyone as everything stuck in it !  . 
my main disappointment and concern with this stuff is strictly limited to the hummers not liking it . 
it reads quicker than the taylor ,  has a calibration function and it looks like it is built to last . 
im sure this was due to the stress of the mail . 
it just hurt as hell !  !  !  !  after num_num hours of agonizing pain i gave up . 
despite almost universal praise in the games press ,  this is a terrible ,  terrible game . 
i did not like the taste of this at all . 
comes in as num_extend goes to internal server as num_extend
the cracks grew until it finally reached the edge so now the entire corner just flaps around . 
i don t understand how such a basic failure in quality control can be allowed to happen . 
i ,  too ,  received nine months old stock with the vacuum seal broken . 
i had lots of problem with this digital camera . 
dont  waste your money in such weak product . 
lovely little earrings ,  with the emphasis on little . 
i m not as impressed as i thought i would be . 
this toothpaste is gooey and oozes out the tube . 
one look at this piece of sheeeet in the trash it wentdo not buy . 
when i hooked them up ,  they only produced a shrill whine . 
the story is lame ,  the controls are different from past resident evil games . 
what was disappointing is that there is no usb charging cable included . 
i have given meaningful beauty products a try . 
this item did not work right out of the retail box . 
this coal tar shampoo didn t do anything for it . 
make sure you are almost a pro at working with marcel handles before purchasing this iron . 
but if you have a great rep they will start dressing like you . 
i was thankful for that ! and i ve got to say ,  the wolf concept was awesome . 
also the bracelets are cheap plastic and way to big to fit on a child s wrist . 
i was disappointed in this game and will just stick to board game clue from now on !  . 
larger birds ,  such as cardinals ,  are too large for the small perch . 
i read the other reviews stating that this perfume was too faint ,  and that you couldn t smell the fragrance . 
these might be ok if higher humidity levels didn t knock them down . 
the motorola reads incoming text messages to me . 
and it died by the end of the week . 
the original battery works for num_num to num_num hours under extreme use . 
my new connections don t get hot at all . 
i usually use a deep ,  shallow bowl for the batter ,  so that there is less waste . 
i don t like the mount on my helmet ,  which ,  despite the three prong grip ,  is subject to slipping off . 
noise cancelation is terrible ,  volume week ,  and sound is tinny . 
the hard bumps all over the outside seam weird . 
dont waste your money on something you dont even get to use one time without it falling apart . 
also if you like solving awkward puzzles ,  this game is for you . 
and the picture of the kitties on it is so cute . 
yes ,  they are gluten and egg free but they re also somewhat tasteless other than sweet . 
i really don t think i ve ever tasted anything worse . 
parabens are estrogen receptors ,  which allow carcinogens ,  etc . 
i m praying this works or it ll be a loooong time until they grow out from the nail bed . 
the hose is sooooo flimsy !  my kid s toy vac has a better one . 
it held up for about num_num months of daily use . 
and it s not very good at the actual lubricating or quieting of the drive . 
i just ended up having to carry my bike lock in a bag . 
i also cant froth for the life of it . 
the pictures are also really hard and overly detailed . 
and it is hard to get them synced . 
the instruction book is very hard to understand . 
i am african american with type num_num hair . 
look in the mirror and see absolutley no difference whatsoever . dont waste your time or money . 
additionally the computers on my network would periodically not recognize each other ,  corrected by rebooting the router . 
makes my hair sticky when it s humid outside . 
i was shocked to read the ingredient list ,  which includes msg . 
this is very well made but it is harder to get on . 
even on crushed snow on the ground i was slipping . 
i can t imagine why this company has a good reputation . 
i think my fellow  nam vets will appreciate this feedback :  do not use the  rain forest  setting . 
it took much longer than num_num minute to dry . 
having to replay loooong segments time after time killed the fun . 
at least that s more than i got out of railroad tycoon num_extend i guess . a huge disappointment . 
like straight from a drug store in china or something . 
don t buy a case to start with like i did . 
it swell up my left feet . i don t like it that much . takako masuda . 
when i powered on the camera ,  took say num_num pictures ,  it would record num_num and lose the last image . 
it would have appeared that i could have broken it . 
the product did come by the date that it said ,  but that date kept changing . 
well ,  it worked fine at first for a cheap dvd player ,  but after about num_num months it stopped working . 
i needed this shirt for a project ,  and the deadline is fast approaching . 
i just ejected this game partway through and put it in my goodwill pile . 
the hose says it s rated to num_extend psi . 
i used the handgun for two practice sessions and one match and the sights worked great . 
lightweight and attractive ,  but these shoes do lack a bit in arch support . 
it didn t ,  it can t ,  and it never will . 
idk ,  these brans probably deserve num_num out of num_extend
bought this inially for my husband and he didn t like it at all . 
when i use this product the next day i break out just a ton . 
purchased because my daughter has a dora doll and wanted boots . 
i put the headset in my piece and bent the second piece . 
and no ,  the product isn t intuitive so you don t need a manual . 
the product is decent and works well ,  the smell is just off putting . 
but i would not suggest running ap without password to anyone . 
it s a great idea ,  but i at least got a serious lemon . 
so needless to say ,  when brawl came out ,  i snapped it up . 
i felt like she is lifting a rock and i was concern that her jaw might hurt . 
i bought the item . i receive num_num black and num_num white . i will not buy more from this supplier . 
i still let her use it ,  but only under supervision . 
the ring i was sent was a lighter metal and not as good quality as the bower brand . 
once you perform the objective required ,  you can just quit the match and go on to the next objective . 
not planning on buying another seagate any time soon . 
citi electronics lied  just another california bases electronics retailer selling chinese junk  . 
after i received the product i realized it was not made from the root . 
as i also mentioned previously ,  sonicstage has a life of its own . 
sadly ,  it just didn t work at all for me . 
this was still nice and cool a few hours in to a num_extend degree day . 
seriously ,  not sure how this company is even still in business . 
it came in a bag and not a box . 
wanted to send it back but roommate threw away box . 
save time ,  money and aggravation and buy some other tube for your hybrid bike . 
it then took a tour of fedex in america . 
in addition ,  the circumference of the core that is cut out by the device is extremely small . 
when i use to play it ,  i would easily get bored after finishing the first level . 
so i understand their pain with this knife . 
also ,  the blade is not very sharp out of the box . 
normally i just thread my facial hair but i wanted something that would last longer . 
i will stick with my loreal telescopic or maybelline the falsies . 
looked like a good value but didn t cut it . 
sadly ,  this is another product manufactured outside the usa and it s become junk !  . 
we returned the pillow and gave ace back his old one . 
this is a better moisturizer than the lifting moisture cream ,  but i still will not be purchasing this again . 
i was initially happy when the shoes arrived . 
the good ingredients ,  like shea butter and jojoba oil ,  come way towards the end . 
the only product i was using in that area of my face was the eye lifting serum . 
if you like flavored coffee ,  this is okay . 
it s quite annoying and i would not recommend it to a friend . 
i bought it for my son for christmas and already have to buy a new one . 
will not be buying again but thank heaven for amazon that always makes it right without any hassles . 
i will say that the sound and graphics are all decent ,  which is to be expected from square . 
it is going to go to a food shelf . 
fortunately ,  after taking a few charcoal supplements and drinking lots of water it started to feel a bit better . 
we tried mixing them with water and nothing . 
pretty cheap cases ,  but depending on what you are using them for ,  they ll work . 
once bitten ,  she s not twice shy ,  and continues to eat them . 
it only really fits much smaller dinosaurs in it ,  or a few medium sized ones if you are lucky . 
honestly ,  the artwork in this book is a disaster . 
i use it to hack away briars and poison ivy on the fence line sometimes . 
will never be using this product again and definitely not pleased . 
nothing groundbreaking . characters and dialogs :  this is a biggie . 
the  snip it  rows of lace were at my ankles . 
i learned this after i bought the product . 
our son ,  now one year old ,  has liked the leap pad since we got it several months ago . 
most of the chips ,  so far ,  are very broken . 
so i figured this newer model would be even better . 
however ,  it will most likely somewhat degrade the quality of your picture . 
no worries though :  it won t stay attached very long . there is nothing good about this product . 
i take a handful of supplements at a time always and they slide right down but not this sucker . 
with just one use from my son s friend ,  it broke . 
i purchased a different model of bravado nursing bra which i liked quite a lot . 
this would be okay for yoga or walking ,  but i want to run and do high intensity aerobics . 
i ve done a review for it before now too . 
callers complain about lots of noise on my end . 
just get the barilla pasta from the super market instead .  . this one is gummy and tough .  .  . like an overcooked pasta . 
better just to get one of those stippled bones or ribbed plastic rings . 
during the session the smell manages to transform . 
these suck !  i tried them on my mountain bike cause my feet were slipping right off my old pedals . 
it would constantly fail upon reawakening from sleep mode . 
exact same stuff as feline pine but nowhere near their exorbitant price . 
the combination of its muddy tan color and its smell turned them off . 
the phone was the verizon lte version of the galaxy nexus . good :  the price is nice . 
the cable works just great when not installed on this thing and makes a solid connection every time . 
using white vinegar produced equal or better results and is much cheaper . 
finally decided that he would probably be happiest in an only cat home . 
the sound quality when using this adapter is baaad . 
i think i ll keep looking for a better eco option . 
it seems to boost the signal up a bit . 
i choose num_num star because this paper is worthless . 
i think the child mainly plays with the lever and doesn t even look at the pictures . 
the game isn t out ,  no you don t own it ,  you didn t win it in a contest . 
worked for a few more months after drying it out and then quit . 
instead ,  the game is mediocre ,  and the people who could have gotten hooked ,  don t . 
liquid vitamins are the only way to go because they are so absorbable . 
browsing some of the forums ,  i see similar complaints . 
also ,  when i would fry the rosette ,  the tip of the other arm would usually touch the hot oil . 
if you get num_num wrong ,  the whole lot restarts and you have to do them again . 
my cats will chase it but then again they ll chase a piece of tin foil . 
when i first started the training mission ,  i got a look at the gameplay itself . 
if you want to get the job done don t waste your money . 
there are a couple styles ,  but they all pretty much look alike . 
the product concept was great ,  but materials were poor . 
further more ,  even though i enjoy an easy ,  fairly quick game ,  auf takes both of those to extremes . 
the price increase was $ and now it s almost $
i picked up this lens primarily to shoot at night ,  or in darker areas with my num_extend
msg is something i try to avoid if at all possible because isn t healthy and often gives me headaches . 
the color issue isn t that bad ,  but this just is not functional . 
there should have been something to hold it so it won t come loose . 
this could be very dangerous for dogs that are prone to swallowing objects . 
used it once more for an hour ,  had a lot of fun . 
i ordered a size num_num in these and a pack of fruit of the loom . 
it s tiresome after num_num minutes of killing people and monsters without any suspense . 
i forced myself to go through the whole bottle since i paid so much for it . 
i can t believe it has so many great reviews . 
while using rage broad heads we have shot a total of num_num deer in the past num_num years . 
i almost dropped my nikon quite a few times . 
bags and rolls are great ,  but all the canister products and botle and jar seals are worthless . 
if you use the vacuum i guess the bags are fine . 
when scrolling through the main menu ,  as well as application menu ,  there is a noticeable lag . 
if you do ,  i am not sure how long it lasts . 
it took me three emails to get an answer from the company about returning it . 
my kids do like this system ,  and they do play with it frequently . 
i do like the bag .  . but i have my reservations about it being  authentic  . 
this one lasted num_num months and i just bought myself a dyson to replace it . 
the silicone does not fit as right as i thought it would . 
if you play this game you ll see what i mean . 
i also am hypothyroid on num_num grains of armour . 
i waited years for a sequel to manhunt only to be let down on many levels . 
we sometimes have to press it a few times to even get the lights to come on . 
it went back to amazon the day i received it . 
there are better games out there that suck you into the action better . 
they displayed all the individual bigger pieces instead . 
the vendor handled the problem promptly and satisfactorily . 
the storyline is about how jax and sonya have to go after kano , or some kind of bullcrap like that . 
and they are way too easy to break . 
if it said anywhere in the description that these are rothco i wouldnt have ordered . 
i do not let my child play with it unattended or walk with the stick . 
the first day of having it ,  it was perfect . 
plus i do not like supporting companies who are at least partially scam . 
in my experience it is not all that . 
i can t tell you if i even had worms ,  but if i did ,  i would still have them . 
this product caused my relaxed hair to be overly dried after the first use . 
this time a different rep took my call . 
i may return it for a better one . update :  this is a worthless knife . 
i got this for my verizon iphone num_num and while the case looks great ,  its useless . 
i purchased this because of the brand krups but it turned out to be one of those not so great items . 
i live in the sacramento valley ,  so my idea of a hard freeze is about num_num degrees . 
the fibers of this towel don t agree with my skin or my hair . 
glad i got it on a lightening deal . 
the two sides of the actual white pad easily slide and get bunched up . 
i thought this would make a nice addition or replacement for that fan . 
the graphics are very pleasing and the creatures themselves are the best part of the game . 
it doesn t seem to be the same stuff . 
i emptied the food out thinking it was clogged ,  but it s not . 
this is the weakest ,  most tasteless chai i ve consumed thus far . 
lg makes a far better unit and is cheaper ,  longer lasting battery too . 
it took my dog about num_num seconds to flip the bowl over and get all of the food out . 
everyone raved about the smell in the reviews . 
this product was small and hard to hold . 
i have never given such a low review to any product i have ever purchased . 
and the belt loops broke after num_num months of use . 
i am not happy with this company !  slowest shipping ever . 
i wasn t looking to split logs but essentially cut down firewood into small pieces to start a fire . 
at the current price of $ i d say to pass on this . 
this is the first dv camcorder i ve bought . 
i am completely perplexed !  !  !  ! we have loved kamik boots forever . 
thankfully ,  she didn t swallow it and i was right there to take it away . 
i ordered these a while ago for work lunches . 
requires lots of batteries and my kids only like the dance function . 
you get very little in each bottle and it applies very cake like . 
if your a die hard yu yu hakusho fan you probably already have a copy . 
they are definitely not for use in a garden bed . 
overall this is a bummer ,  and i love the regular vice city . 
we are kind of happy she doesn t like it for this reason . 
the square handle makes the unit awkward and sometimes painful to num_extend
don t be cheap when buying a scale ,  the powder charge is the single most important part of reloading . 
i normally use crosman destroyers and they are super accurate out of my num_extend
for less than sixteen months this kettle worked like a charm . 
it smells like one of those candy necklaces we used to buy when we were kids . 
this cream is awful and i do not like its consistency or the way it smells . 
they don t even hold firm when you secure the belt head . 
i was rather surprised at the size of the `rock  ,  it is tiny . 
just because other people say it s good doesn t make it so . 
i m going back to my normal campbell chicken noodle soups . 
feels like you have hairspray in your hair for days .  .  . after several washings . 
and my kids outgrew it very fast ,  it has a short lige span in childrens ages in my opinion . 
yuck !  !  i ve been using these for years ,  but this last batch makes my water taste bitter and undrinkable . 
you can t blow up anything like you can in goldeneyeso compared to goldeneye ,  id skip this game . 
the weight of these are horrible ,  and they won t cut through anything easily . 
i had to grab hot nail to make the hole more grade . 
i don t like popww as much as popsot . 
personally ,  i find being called the equivalent of a smartphone num_extend very patronizing . 
it took them about two months to do this . 
i have not yet ridden my bike with the new tube . 
i now have brown roots and the rest of my hair is black . 
it s up to you if you want to spend $ to give it a try . 
i don t want to get into vivid details . 
so out of one recipe ,  half weren t usable . 
i wanted so badly for this product to work . 
upon examination somehow the ink they used on the bottle was running and getting into the bottle . 
however ,  it is a bit os a dissapointment if you are expecting anything more from it . 
i have since replaced it with a larger kvm with more features . 
i will not be buying another midland weather radio . 
installed the driver but could not get it to work under windows num_extend
but they do ,  so i won t be buying more . 
let this be a lesson to all those who are cheapskates  or recovering cheapskates ,  in my case  . 
had this lemon about a year and it broke . 
it was also hard to apply and didn t stick to my hair . 
i love park products ,  but i think a mountain biker tested these levers . 
once that subsided they worked as expected ,  nothing sensational and frankly i couldn t wait to wash them off . 
however ,  simply to the point ,  the game ends up being is a  gathering card  game . 
it won t work for that if it s going to peel off any smooth surface when dry . 
then again ,  it won t take you long to get through the game either . 
the gunk itself formed a hard substance in the palm of my hand that defies breakage . 
my new lens will not work with my canon new num_extend
suction darts jam the easiest ,  don t use those with this gun ,  there isn t a good work around . 
 which is across the room  both do the same thing with a variety of different peripherals . 
range said to be num_num feet but in reality it appears to be more like num_num feet . 
so we have a half case of it sitting around collecting dust . 
a  no treatment  group of num_num cats received no lysine during the course of the study . 
well ,  it just so happened that time changed back an hour right after i purchased the watch . 
prior to this we had owned a motorized press that was terrible . 
the day i got it i played it for num_num hours !  i had so much fun . 
but lame bluetooth connection and low volume is just gave this stupid thing away . 
a little nervous about using more than a teaspoon at a time ,  actually . 
it s a far better brush ,  bigger and better designed . 
it may be better for people with dry skin . 
a bit too small and complicated for a year and a half boy . 
it sucks because it really helped light up my case . 
i can t believe people would ever pay more than $ on this thing . 
i have tried worse products than this . the fragrance is very fake smelling and extreme . 
i ordered slacks in the same size at the same time as this order ,  and they fit fine . 
in addition ,  the bell on the elevator does not work well . 
don t order this if expecting to be full cover nails to just glue ,  paint and wear . 
called the company asking about return policy  had free shipping  . 
also the human and alien voices are fun to hear . 
i called them and got an immediate refund and was able to order this product again . 
the sb card took two minutes to install . 
no option to be alerted if you enter the wrong number in a cell . 
 not in a good way .   this product felt very strange on my feet . 
if they could be calibrated or consistent in their inaccuracy it would be ok . 
fully charged i get almost an hour before a noticeable drop off in power . 
this is horribly designed and a terrible vacuum . 
the bone is exactly as described ,  so it is just the dogs prefer something else . 
this is a cute idea ,  but really ,  is quite pitiful . 
the adapter will just add more weight to your phone . 
stay away unless you get a cash back guarantee . 
i am in total agreement with the previous reviewer and would like to add that this thing leaks . 
spring is so strong that it kept pulling the screws out of the door or rv body . 
the length was right and the thickness was fantastic . 
yes it sits on top of the jar and doesn t fall in but that s about all it does . 
that part of the gameplay is similar to previous games . 
this supposedly brand new battery came out of the package with a pink liquid indicator . 
i bought this game the day it came . 
i set a separate ssid and my devices could not see the num_extend radio or connect to it . 
it does grip the iphone well ,  and you can orient it up and down or sideways . 
look at the nutritional information ,  i don tcare if you are in a rush ,  don t have time to cook ,  whatever . 
they are all thiner than paper ,  and don t even hold their shape . 
to date metroid prime hunters is the best graphics on the ds . 
if you don t ,  you will crash in time . 
i would have to agree with gamespot . com ,  this game will only appeal to true arcade fans . 
patience pays and we finally assembled the cage . 
my daughter put all the horses in a barn yard house she has and never looked at them again !  . 
my refunded was posted to my account in just num_num days . 
so if it is so % natural why can t you injest it ?  the label also says .  .  . not for internal use . 
i received a pad that is designed to be used by itself . 
it worked pretty good when i bought it a couple of years ago . 
however ,  to fully appreciate that ,  even in today s standard ,  go with the pc . 
for others ,  it s likely the flavor is too strong to be pleasant . 
my guess .  .  . made in china for close to nothing and sold for ten times more . 
this was really a great chair while my son was on stage num_num and num_num foods . 
i came on this site and asked for a refund . 
it caused instant hot flashes that lasted the entire time i used this product . 
we bought this as a mother s day gift ,  and it worked well about num_num times . 
the weight is just not what i expected of  sweatpants  that i am used to . 
why are mobile devices classed as smartphones assembled without memory card slots . i wanted to love it . 
that s why it gets the two stars i gave it . 
this is my fourth cuisinart coffee maker to fail . 
even though i paid very little ,  they were not worth the money . 
if ever a game deserved an  m  rating  or worse  ,  this one does . 
it has a confirmed serious memory leak problem . 
do not get for cats and it is better suited for small horses . 
we hung the jacket in the garage and it stunk up the garage . 
you need the bottom pan filled with boiling water in order to cook with the upper double boiler section . 
they weren t very tart ,  and tasted slightly salty to me . 
unfortunately ,  i did not do enough research and bought this nr  no refrigeration  version . 
external inputs  all of them !   become unselectable when the guide+ system takes over . 
i can t wait to start using it tomorrow . 
dog has been taking this for over a week and still does this disgusting behavior . 
i found that they were actually more difficult to use than the silicone scrapers i already have . 
another problem is that it s very similar to the resistance ,  but the resistance is way better . 
i have tried these and had absolutely zero response from the recommended dose . 
i find fleas dead in their fur and fleas acting like they re dying on the pet bed . 
as far as expansions go ,  the race for the galaxy expansions are not overly good . 
it would be better if the green cover would stay on . 
but it does charge up real quick i live in two homes . diffently needs to be waterproof . 
this is the second vsmile we ve gotten this year . 
i love trackballs ,  and tried this one because my hand fit it well . 
i would upgrade my rating to two stars but amazon will not allow that . 
so the attack and repel modes didn t work without a second unit . 
i couldn t believe how lousy it was ,  i had read some other reviews and they seemed positive . 
this one clumps up ,  and yes ,  i do know how to cure my nails and have the necessary tools . 
paba free; it must spell out on the face of the num_extend
the graphics are bad ,  the fighters are boring ,  and i think this game doesn t have fatalities !  . 
they remind me of bore cleaner patch semi compressed . save your money . 
there are games where you hop in vehicles and do things . 
there really was nothing impressive about the product . 
it can remove any regular make up however ,  you have to rub it out for waterproof make up . 
this is conventional ,  not a gmo but certainly not organic . 
i guess you get what you pay for . 
everything garmin makes is proprietary so that nothing else will work on a garmin . 
this may be useful for some people but definitely not for me . 
ive been hearing rave reviews about the carol s daughter line for years . 
the lack of brushing will cause build up of bacteria over time and that will get in bloodstrean . 
then i saw it on amazon .  .  . for a fraction of the retail price . 
one down side ,  bottles can and will fell off due to the fact of the design . 
this stuff must taste horrible because i can not get my cats to take this stuff . 
however all this is totally negated by the crappy ramp construction . 
it seems like a very expensive price for what you get . 
i couldnt get the ends curled or even wavey so the nice flowy looking curls i have . 
since i suffer from fibrocystic breasts ,  i decided to take a small amount num_extend mg a day num_extend tablet  . 
it is quite bothersome while sleeping ,  the tag that is . 
i had great hopes for this product ,  considering the great reviews i read . 
there was nothing like this in super metroid . 
the box it was shipped in wasn t wet . 
this device comes with a remote  which is awesome  . 
i was a little put off because it was complicated ,  and wasn t  dripless  as promised . 
filled with yucks aplenty ,  grim fandango is like participating directly in a wacky animated film . 
i thought that the cleanser was not to blame so i kept using it . 
dreamcast has something to prove to both the people who have bought it and to psx addicts . 
but take my advice ,  leave this one on the shelf . 
all in all ,  i m really dissapointed in this game . 
this pad was supposed to be num_num inches thick . 
as they commented ,   it was like our own nest  . 
upon entering the mission you immediately get a lengthy raido message about the mission objective again . 
its hard to know where the shots are coming from ,  and where the enemy is . 
is it the number ?  is it the shape ?  maybe this time it s going to be the animal . 
this is easily one of the least stable games i ve ever played . 
the case is so small it does not fit the iphone or our vibrant . 
the original canon battery lasted four years and many recharge cycles . 
we set this trap out there thinking we would catch the mouse and not hurt the squirrel . 
i ended up running down to walmart and buying a more appropriate scoop . 
mine had little pieces of green beans ,  sweet potatoes ,  carrots .  .  . i love thai food .  .  . but this is nothing like thai food . 
but my puppy cannot get the treats out of it . 
i enjoy many types of tea ,  the more flavorful the better . 
would i recommended ?  no probably not ,  sorry just being honest . 
i don t mind paying a lot of money for a dog harness if it is worth it . 
i ve ordered a le sportsac frame bag and that will replace this as soon as it arrives . 
my children num_extend and num_extend recieved this as a present . 
i even attached a signal amplifier to it ,  and it didn t seem to help much . 
i measured liquid and i measured dry to check it out . 
it tastes like a yogurt smoothie that was left out in the sun a little too long . 
while in the darkworld you are always being damaged unless surrounded by these light crystals . 
in the pics this mask looks like there is mesh covering the eye and mouth holes . 
it costs a little more ,  but save yourself the headache and just get one . 
i have always loved the palm but go through them like bic lighters so i tried the hp . 
this box of crayons is actually several smaller boxes of the exact same colors . 
i bought this arm blaster because i used to have one growing up and i loved it . 
there s a tab on the plastic hopper that pushes a lever which adjusts the fineness of the grind . 
i am not impressed with tiffen filters i got in this set . 
also it may be okay for a cat ,  but even a small dog really does not fit in it . 
this is the worst coffee pot i have ever owned . 
as others have remarked ,  they run very large ,  so order one size smaller than you normally wear . 
i rolled the dice and lost ,  now got to go through purchasing all over again . 
at least with lipstick it is an even color . so i cannot recommend this product . 
else i don t feel like carrying it with me when i ought to . 
i would say ,  for the product itself ,  it does what it says . 
the motor on this machine is too weak to suck up the water and dirt after scrubbing . 
this is the worst grill i have ever owned . 
it also has more compartments to separate what i need to take with me for my camera . 
no wedding band looks this inexpensive ,  even from k mart . 
i switched to using the hakuba cases which in my opinion is so much better . 
our car gets lots of use and starts smelling stuffy . 
i can t give this a fair review as i refuse to use it . 
that provides a rock solid hold on the trigger ,  and two other forms of backup if you want it . 
no one needs their products ,  they are unfit for consumption by animals and humans . 
i ended up buying a futuro arm band which is much better made and cost only $ more . 
i have a lot of muscle knots in my back ,  and this has done very little to alleviate them . 
that about sums it up . i definately would not buy this game . 
as soon as he puts his phone in the holster it slides right out . 
it is actually num_num mega bits ,  which is equal to num_num mega bytes . 
when you try to use them they won t unfold without a lot of extra ,  unnecessary work . 
buy it from anyone who will not give your credit card number to ronco . 
but bought num_extend that is just beautiful ,  this was made in china ,  you amazon don t need to represent this product anymore . 
this was not a problem with the ide settings or dma . 
if you use the phone ,  it drops its charge time dramatically . 
if she didn t get better i was going to take her to the vet . 
it appears that i will still be brewing dunkin donuts coffee at home . 
i bought this in addition to my ninja . 
it would be great if it was just bigger . 
there are three main problems with this product . 
doesn t color gray very well ,  even salonist said so when cutting my hair . 
there was no coffee flavor to the bar other than bitterness . 
at least then i ll know there are enough and that they are thick enough . 
this item arrived in a plastic sandwich bag . 
the door popped open with such frequency that i didn t use the timer after a few tries . 
they got so frustrated that it hasn t been touched again . 
i ve reactivated my old optimus v and will stick with that one . what s wrong with the motorola num_extend
try amy s instead if you re not gluten intolerant . 
who knows ,  but ,  it was not what i expected . 
it also says don t allow them to ingest pieces larger then rice or something like that . 
i added sour cream and some water to counter the dryness and bad taste ,  but it did not help . 
these things didn t do anything to prevent peek through !   awful . 
however ,  as a first time customer i would expect some assistance and support . 
up until now ,  that has worked well for me . 
too bad i wasted the money on it . problems : hard to put together ,  once its put together it falls apart . 
when i opened my mailbox i found the package box was damaged and opened . 
and no matter how hard i tried ,  i couldn t get past how badly it was made . 
while it heats well ,  it s just way too hard to use . 
given that i bought it last week ,  i m returning it . 
my braun num_num suddenly began making a loud noise after about six months . 
i did not see and increase at all . 
it makes it very difficult to get the laptop in and out . 
only sometimes ,  and only if you are lucky . 
it also has a smell when plugged in like something is melting . 
the sounds are not very natural and the smells are well .  .  . smelly . 
the price is cheap but so is the product . 
it s hot ,  and sweet ,  with an overwhelming taste of garlic . 
the plastic build does not hold up under use and repairs are more than the camera is worth . 
this product is very small and is very cheaply made . 
recipient did not find the case any easier to use than a pocket is . 
i had high hopes ,  and they were shot down . 
did not last long and did not do what they are intended to do . 
after one or two wears and washes ,  the neckline stretched and got disfigured and floppy . 
the same goes for sound ,  which is minimal ,  and music ,  which is poor if even existent . 
do not buy this game does not work with windows vista . 
consider the gateway dvd recorder ,  which is cheaper and has a much ,  much better user interface . 
which ,  as you can guess ,  screws up the tuning everytime . 
i really like my panasonic digital voice record ,  as far as recording and playback go . 
the  adjustable height  only adds about two inches . 
im starting to think jawbone is the better buy . 
the construction is heavier and  clunkier  than it needs to be to perform its job properly . 
it is also so wide that it rubs on my thighs . 
no one can touch my hear with this stuff without washing it after . 
this is all the time i want to waste talking about this . 
i don t recommend wasting cash on this one . 
the legs are slim but not skinny and the waist ,  while sitting on the hips . 
obviously they didn t coat the hardware  screws and such  ,  as these rust first . 
it did not slick down my edges and it also left a residue on my hair . 
if you are new to pokemon ,  definitely don t start with this game . 
it also helps get rid of all head aches and sinus problems . 
when i received these i read the directions on the package . 
however ,  it works well for my mom ,  who has normal skin . 
i bought these shoes based on the reviews posted . 
the other thing is that they cook your ears . 
subtract some for the box and foam packing material ,  and it s still pretty close to num_num pounds . 
same battle music is repeated over and over throughout the entire game . 
if you have a shallow crown this may work for you . 
she was disappointed ,  as she said it wasn t very powerful . 
my puppy was choking on the yellow cover . 
crazy taxi is one of sega s more successful franchises ,  yet it s one of it s weakest . 
this game i don t think lived up to the legend of zelda standard . 
i only used the gps for about num_num minutes and then turned it off . 
it also broke me out in this little red bumps . 
i have tried to clean the roller but it did not help . don t buy junk ,  folks !  . 
the metal scraper loop that expels the ice cream is unbelievably flimsy and very tenuously attached on both ends . 
i guess taking the easy way out is just not that great . 
the formula is too watery to really stay in place . 
we used to have a smaller bodum and that glass carafe seemed stronger and thicker . 
this conditioner is a terrible deal ,  i m sorry to say . 
unfortunately ,  it cannot carry the high current required to operate and charge most higher end smartphones . 
even though it can t be lined up perfectly ,  the coring part still works fairly well . 
firmware update did nothing and tech support is a joke . 
the inferiority is obvious on a good hdtv screen . 
i can t get the lid to go on this shaker . 
second the trays are expensive and messy to change . 
leaked on first use ,  i had to patch the pvc . 
trendnet has a better product for half the cost . 
these lashes did blend into my lashes after i trimmed the longest part of the outer edges off slightly . 
i guess i just don t like earbuds in general . 
it says unscented but the ingredients in it gave it a strange musty smell . 
if the straps had been made to go between the footbed and sole it may be better . 
the mines of moria are particularly notorious for crashing a lot ,  but crashes happen elsewhere as well . 
this item is too small for large amounts of pasta . 
i searched online for an explanation and could not find any . 
i am mystified by the number of really mediocre games that get high ratings on amazon . 
highly disappointed as i thought ecotools were good quality . 
water it down ,  take out the complexity and puzzles . 
the swiffer allows easy switch out of pads and it is cheaper than buying pads for the mysticmop . 
they are pretty the same way waxed fruit is and just as inedible . 
you can do this even on those zits that are past the early stages . 
in no way did they feel as good ,  posture correcting ,  pain relieving of my back ,  bunions ,  other problems . 
i had high hopes for this product ,  but it didn t do anything good to my hair . 
if there were any reviews like this one ,  i sure missed them . 
one more thing .  .  . this computer is made of metal . 
ever since then ,  i ve witnessed the downfall of sonic the hedgehog . 
at least they re not over the actual touch screen . 
i got some on my eyelashes and it would not come off . 
stripping it off doesn t work all the way either . 
and i m not some teenage kid who plays so many games that only the very latest graphics will do . 
i received lock on only one station depending on where i stood in the room ,  for a few seconds . 
link  the real one  was supposed to be in it . 
i am a victime of the keurig company . 
this is terrible !  i am upset and disappointed ! i ordered a pair of num_num jeans using a size . 
this is one of the pitfalls of buying online . 
we duct taped it back on and he gnawed through the duct tape . 
i usually kept the spout open so i wouldnt hear the whistle . 
this day lotion isn t horrible ,  but i don t much like it . 
this game also has some of the worst dialogue i ve ever heard . 
should of known better and bought a more quality slip for more money . 
i don t know why they don t tell you the size of it . 
but at $ and the issues with the app ,  i can t recommend it for general use . 
i find the story hard ,  and boring ,  as well as the rest of the game . 
getting the head clean is a real chore as it can t be disassembled . 
i do have to say though it is the most comfortable headphones i have ever owned . 
adding water makes it foam for a minute . 
unfortuneatley this product didn t work on my pug . 
i ve tried to put everything on them hoping they would heal . 
i have really bad lower back pains and my posture  hips  are slightly misaligned . 
still looking for a good meow mix replacement . 
and ,  for a fairly new product technology ,  it s comparable to the other major manufacture of this kind ,  the powermat . 
besides that its made with heavy duty metal ,  should hold up just fine . 
i don t really use any of them except for the foundation brush . 
my cats have never been picky eaters ,  but none of them were particularly thrilled with this food . 
although these protectors appear to be durable they really aren t . 
i gave to my son in hopes that it will help him . 
i disassembled the unit which was easy enough ,  but reassembling after fixing the issue was not . 
but the way it broke makes it bad news in any kitchen . 
this game is a waste of the wwe license . 
she could hook it and pull it free on her second try . 
they only reason i give it num_num stars is that it is comfortable around my head . 
hopefully it was just the one pair that was weird . 
when i tried to break them into smaller pieces ,  the treats crumbled into bits . 
maybe my shoulders aren t  squared  enough for it . 
i am so disappointed that this happened after paying for the product . 
boy was i surprised with the poor quality when they showed up . 
before use you need to remove a  factory coating  and then season it . 
i have two major problems with this num_extend
i have samsung galaxy num_extend t mobile num_extend
my mother purchased this for my daughter for christmas . 
cat feces can be very toxic to other animals . 
the plastic does go back to original form but worries after time as it may snap off . 
i got this originally to have a microusb cable to carry around in my pocket to charge my phone . 
they are great flavors and nice way to eat that fruit . 
i need to play on the hardest setting ,  and it is still easy . 
my suggestion ,  though ,  would be to invest in a lego set instead . 
however ,  if purchasing please be aware that helmets deteriorate over time . 
eventually it starts to lose its cutting ability and can no longer open effectively . 
i was so disappointed when i read the label on this product . 
but luckily that was the only one out of the three that busted . 
i don t think this is a good solution . 
net result :  back to trimming the old fashioned way . 
my advise is if you re considering doing the same thing ,  don t . 
oh but that sound quality was second to none  sniff ,  sniff  . 
its cute and it s wood that s where it ends . 
i used one packet in a large cup and added hot water . 
i wish i knew why it s leaking air ,  but maybe it s the entire product . 
i may get just a plain bag with no  appendages  ,  like hair ,  arms ,  or noses . 
the opening screens are amazing and graphics during the game are great . 
i live in a tornado zone ,  so putting together a survival kit has kept me busy . 
these speakers are by far the worst sounding speakers i ever owned . 
my daughter loves pretend food but these are so small ,  i m concerned they will be forgotten during playtime . 
next thing i know ,  both my dogs ,  being dogs ,  are eating the frayed pieces of laminate . 
the lack of directionality from these speakers is an attribute when there are a wide range of seating options . 
i was disappointed in it the moment she opened it and it was turned on . 
i did keep it though ,  so we ll see . 
was smaller than i anticipated and they do not fly . 
it always sounded a little loose and moved easily . 
i bought this and tried three different plugs and it doesn t work properly . 
unfortunately ,  it makes the gps harder to read ,  especially if the light is not ideal . 
the look and feel is good ,  but not the fit . 
i used it for a month ,  and reduced the number weekly applications once my face started freaking out . 
and this is where you will run out of room . the replacement drive is overpriced . 
i was so looking forward to receiving this wallet . 
bad for the environment ,  wasteful ,  and bad for the wallet . 
it says it is very quiet and has no vibration . 
i am not sure who is writing the reviews .  .  . but this is like water .  .  . does nothing .  .  . does not work . 
apparently it  might  also only contain about half that ,  in my case ,  num_num bags . 
i am in love ,  love ,  love with this watch . 
i was not sure if this is the right one so i ordered the travel pack . 
i just needed it for my counter top deep fryer . 
the wrench kept slipping off and started gouging the nut of the pedal . 
it was possible to insert the post and use the feeder ,  but it looks a bit cockeyed . 
maybe this item is defective ,  or maybe it s just generally poorly made . 
almost num_num weeks have gone by and nothing . 
the cost nearly is the same and the others have actual useful blades . 
however ,  during my second time using it the hinge broke on mine ,  as well . 
i like their body wash and body lotion ,  but cannot use this product again . 
after a few months of use i barely got it to last longer than num_num hours . do yourself a favor . 
there really needs to be a warning on the box for this stuff . 
rolling the literbox wasn t as good in practice as it first sounded either . 
my hair lasted frizz free until i washed it again . 
i think it came out like that ,  because the package was fine . 
this product gives my dog diarrhea so i would not recommend this product . 
every time i touch it my hand it would reek of this treat . 
when i blow dried my hair it wouldn t dry at all . 
i m trying them one more time then that s it . 
i bought a size up and those were still just as impossible to get on . 
the ugly ,  i will not trust these to be left on unattended because they get so hot . 
the fix was to pull the stem at the num_extend position and press it back in ,  firmly . 
the rainbow just does not behave like it is pictured in the product photo . 
this does not it a num_num kia lx sorento . 
it s a lot smaller than i anticipated and the quality is mediocre at best . 
the regular breads were great .  .  . so it s not me or the machine . 
i have no idea what pillow was in that video ,  but it s not the pillow they sent me . 
it only took one glance at this feeder to realize it has a major design flaw . 
i would like to also add that no size num_num foot could ever fit comfortably in these socks . 
spend the money ,  get the otterbox commuter instead . 
it is not natural looking like the blue blacks i ve used in the past . 
this wedge is too thick to be comfortable for sleeping . 
it looked so good on tv ,  but it didn t clean any better than windex . 
i should have paid more attention before i bought . 
moved too easily to be of good use . 
we replaced our num_extend and num_extend with fiestaware ,  and couldn t be happier . 
i seriously question this as i have never seen this product in the store . 
this gave the impression that it was a genuine samsung case . 
be careful with these people . the second one i received is not the one shown . 
i tried this product in hope it would slow him down a bit and stop this . 
i like the way it holds my phone ,  but it slides all over the dashboard . 
at least they shd have mentioned it in the instructions . this to me is a major product defect . 
for one thing ,  these run about a half an inch to an inch too large around the waste . 
i am very disappointed i didn t realize sooner . 
my num_num cats like to scratch near the top of the wave while laying in the curved part . 
fortunately ,  after i delete a few pictures ,  i could move on . 
messy ! a few of the spices themselves started getting stuck in the base and were very hard to pull out . 
i have a very handy husband who can fix anything but this was not one of them . 
this is not a reliable product ,  and was not worth the premium price i paid for it . 
the num_num original fit will behave pretty much like all other levis that are not shrink to fit jeans . 
this model ,  the pieces come apart very easily ,  almost too easily . 
now it will not engage and allow the heating elements to function . 
it s a cheap knock off made in chinanot the us . 
the landscape is changing in the gaming market . 
they need to be able to use all their strength and agility to climb these rather small steps . 
it could be absolutely any antenna in there . 
it has a high amount of antioxidants which protect from cancer ,  ageing and inflammation . 
if you don t oil them ,  you will not be able to get the eggs out in one piece . 
i ho e i will be abli to figyre this gane out . 
the second one worked perfectly for about four weeks before it developed the same problem with the volume . 
like wearing a rag atop your head . bill too long . 
grenade explosions also sound weak as do machine gun fire . 
may be ics will change this ,  but i doubt it . 
i purchased the itrip hoping to use it in my car . 
the shirt that this one replaced lasted me several years . 
the formula seems much healthier than nutella ,  but some parts were too salty . 
i ,  like many other reviewers of this product ,  also own one of the mr . 
i guess others are lucky; this never worked for my wife and i; wasted money . 
i unscrewed this and noticed the fuse looked bad . 
both broke within a day of first use . 
i see the pic and it showing that there were num_num of them . 
i just wasn t impressed at all in either case . 
the graphics such even for the sega genesis . 
gave it to my nephew and he didn t like it either . 
however ,  it can be secured on lawn with the provided pins . 
i ve been taking this product for about num_num days and i have not noticed any changes . 
it s made by old wisconsin and is very ,  very good . 
a weak cell signal is a common problem with concrete and metal buildings shielding those signals out . 
i can t think of a food that is worse than this . 
this items is supposed to be used for safe inhalation of steam for your sinuses . 
also there is a maximum level that your character can go and after that nothing more . 
i tried giving it to my girlfriend and her baby had the same reaction . 
this soap will lighten your skin and leaves your skin feeling extremely dry . 
we now have a policy that palm num_extend and num_extend are discouraged . 
environmentalconcerns are unlikely to weigh heavily ,  if at all ,  in this profitability equation . 
i was disappointed by the smell of this oil . 
i m laughing at myself right now for being silly enough to order this . 
i would not recommend these pads at all . 
next ,  the safety seal in the lid started seating improperly and allowing steam to escape . 
if it was only a quick  wrap  ,  there wouldn t be any gel in the knuckles . 
this sneaker did not  wear well  at all . 
it wasn t worth returning it ,  so i just threw it away . 
may give it one more chance a little later . 
this game could do alot better than it really did . 
this set comes with num_num packages of moon dough . 
i measured him and everything before purchasing and followed the instructions to a t . 
we hoped that it stopped working because the battery died ,  but no such luck . 
i m not usually that sensitive so i was surprised . 
i had to run a tap though most of the treaded holes . 
she seemed to know a little more ,  but not much . 
after reading the reviews i was anxious to get this product . 
if it were a chocolate or vanilla flavor the whey would have been fine . 
just imagine what kind of image will be conveyed to people when you carry this bag on your shoulder . 
i prefer my coffee to have some sweetness and cream . 
well ,  we tried this and had mixed results . 
this scratching post and others like it are horrible . 
i have a num_extend letterbox toshiba tv  not high definition  . 
it is big ,  blurry ,  and images of num_num eyes are not aligned  returned this one  . 
after a day of fiddling with it ,  the wheels randomly began to spin . 
the problem is not the power is the design . 
i got this game when it first came out ,  it was quite buggy . 
really annoying ,  as this case is hard and is a bit of a struggle to open everytime . 
the amount of glare it picks up is ridiculous . 
these are to big for my big head . 
this model picks up the dirt and hair sure enough but the problems are annoying . 
i am not a happy camper with this battery charger . 
that keyboard is intuitive and makes typing very quick and easy . 
i ve bought lots of celestial seasonings products and have for years . 
in fact i just threw out a bottle i had in the refrigerator . 
the deeper the color or the more i consumed ,  the worse the experience . 
you d think with all these natural ,  real ingredients ,  it would taste real . 
it s nice that they are both sugar and gluten free ,  but unfortunately ,  they are also taste free . 
but the mic works and it is little money . 
example :  a destroyed ship has parts blowing up around the ship model . 
also the rubber part started peeling off also . 
he also thought the length was too short . 
i loved the concept of having a teddy bear as my cover . 
but like everyone else who commented on this game ,  that s about it . 
i like everthing about this purse except it durability . 
we ve charged them num_num times with the same result . 
on one ,  the silicon rubber was already so bad they would not stay up . 
it finally got a hole and so we decided to replace it . 
i read reviews that his brush was too hard but in my case it was too soft . 
and the game is greedy when it comes to giving you extra life . 
within five minutes ,  i could feel the  energy  being released .  .  . vroom ,  vroom . 
it was subtle ,  and you won t recognize many of the themes ,  but they added real atmosphere . 
at first ,  i was happy with the zire and recommended it for those who only want the basics . 
took forever to iron hair and there was no temp setting . 
since it s pretty much a small log of toffee ,  this isn t ideal . 
cannot say how the corkscrew is because i never got one . 
for what they are ,  these are good headphones at a good price  because they are being discontinued soon  . 
it could just be my skin ,  but it does not sit well on my face . 
this holster ,  while beautiful leather and craftmanship ,  is not it . 
i overdosed on somethin in rainbow light and it made me sick . 
i had read elsewhere that this tasted like a starbux product . 
the blades on this machine ,  however ,  are about as sharp as a butter knife . 
we were very excited and thought it would be great fun . 
it may good for a family of num_extend but not for a family of num_extend
besides ,  they sell it for cheaper direct than by going through any middlemen . 
real filtered water is num_extend the design bites on top of that . 
i did also purchase ov s chocolate milk ,  my son loves it . 
i would not recommend this to anyone ,  unless you like crappy graphics and sophisticated controls . 
the game also attempts a kind of combat that is clunky and unsophisticated; it adds nothing to the game . 
i had been looking for some new nancy drew games to play ,  and decided to get this one . 
i play mostly sports games ,  and this one is one of the worst that i ve played . 
lol my nieces and their friends have had tons of fun sitting in it ,  goofing around with it . 
even with the mouse patch ,  aiming is a supreme pain in the butt . 
what a waste of money and it is too dangerous to donate . 
i hate this stuff !  it didn t do anything to help my acne . 
for those who want the original lets hope nintendo makes a better num_extend one ,  or settle for this . 
after num_num minutes of game play my character walked about num_num miles through thick fog and junk graphics . 
the older ones didn t like it because the are used to better quality and could not play simple tunes . 
i didn t find it worked any better than washing my face any other way . 
the polarization process works ,  although not as good as high end versions . 
we left home on april num_extend and returned on august num_extend
having a bowel movement is the only thing these pills have done which i not why i purchased them . 
this did not come with a cd ,  so there were no instructions and no driver software . 
i would never get his again this is harder then it looks . 
that is another rip off . update :  after getting the second one ,  we are now pissed off at this product . 
it is also bulky and gets in the way of either dashboard controls or turn signals . 
and ,  they fit in the same pc card slot on most laptops made in the last decade . 
i do think it s also stylish without trying to look  designerish  . 
the unit will connect to my pc and they talk but no music is listed in the server . 
so ,  i ordered a new case because this isn t going to work for me long term . 
i read the reviews from owners who said the pump was loud but many others said it was not . 
num_extend were difficult to get on and adjusted ,  but so are these . 
i guess i will have to keep looking !  . 
i m usually a fan of lee products ,  being cheap and effective ,  however they crossed the line with this one . 
i put it on my electric stove top and it does not remove easy at all . 
i m not a big fan of  push a button ,  hear some noise  toys . 
but none of these settings is available if you want to use the self num_extend
the name kianna is from a bratz doll . 
but this game seems to have no identity . 
i bought this for my num_num year old for christmas and he loved it . 
these went into the garbage after one use . 
another option is sudoku mania ,  which is better and less expensive . 
they definitely were detailed and quick accurate ,  but they definitely lacked the sound quality i expected . 
it seemed to sit on top of my skin without really sinking in . 
i never had this happen with the android  , guess i was lucky . 
the movie s great but the game is terrible . 
the teeth probably should be made of metal . 
if you really want one of these ,  you can find mine in my trash can ,  and it s free . 
the website picture suggests that this is a clear case . 
i don t know if it ever does anything besides stop  beating  when the battery is dead . 
they didn t finish this game and released it anyway . 
i have a son with sensory problems and he loved the way this felt on his feet and hands . 
i will say that i didn t find them gritty or overly sweet . 
easy to set up ,  and the automatic shut off is awesome . 
unlike my old one it does not empty without digging out the grounds . 
the suction cup on it was the . sticky type and it would suction to about anything . 
i m going to wait and see what schwinn does . 
this waterbottle drenched my rats in num_num ounces of water because it leaksdo not buy this !  do not buy !  . 
this is a great idea ,  but it broke on thanksgiving  first use  . 
at the end of january ,  the inside blades quit turning . 
i have a lot of redness on my face ,  so i thought i would try this concealer . 
it really barely is picking up anything anymore . 
either that or my multi taps b ,  c and d ports are messed up . 
this was within a couple weeks of getting it . 
however ,  both tend to run a bit big . there are two pockets . 
when you shoot num_num bullets with a gun ,  mabye num_extend your girl looks at the roof . 
the units seem to not auto attack buildings and sometimes even enemy troops . 
overall this product works on my num_extend itouch and num_num and num_extend ipod . 
it cuts great after you get it lined up perfectly ,  but if you don t ,  it just snags the paper . 
it just seems no matter how much or little i can t get a good taste out of it . 
i hope that jarrow renames this so as not to confuse the consumer . 
i should have just let the money go and dropped this camera a long time ago . 
the other one i bought is much better ,  and it was cheaper too . 
as much as possible ,  i try to buy from amazon products only to avoid headaches . 
favorites aren t as easy at the blackberry numbers . 
i don t have deep wrinkles so i should have seen some difference . 
i would have liked it had it been usable . 
some searching turned up nothing useful for these errors . 
i found the chocolate to be quite bitter . 
it leaks along the tiny wrinkles and spreads out like an amazonian river . 
my pharmacist stopped me from making this mistake and i am so grateful to him for it !  . 
it s good enough just to drive around springfield and forget the missions . 
however ,  this year amazon . com ll sent me the wrong shade . 
it fell out of my ear every time . 
sometimes you have reddish chunks that are more tender and soft but the darker chunks are generally very dry . 
if the item is coming i haven t seen it . 
it takes up too much counter space .  .  .  . enough said !  !  !  !  . 
if i could give this one star ,  i would . 
i will give it until the num_extend before i really complain . 
that being a fairly important issue ,  i decided to devote a whole review to it . 
strangely ,  its  fans seem to really like it . 
the only thing that worked was the volume control . 
i went in to prisoner of azkaban expecting more of the same . 
there are num_num buckles including the bottom one . 
i would prefer it didn t make a mess all over my counter . 
maybe if i m persistent and keep spraying this stuff  in heavier amounts  i will have some luck . 
now i have a bunch of tapes that are bad . 
so that s why num_num stars and not num_extend
they run about saying  oh poo  and other similiar phrases . 
it s too large and heavy for someone who has trouble clearing leaves by other means . 
it is pretty useless for children to use in the kitchen ,  and really cheap plastic . 
i found my exquisite cup of chai by chance . 
i have a sun conure and he made short work of both of these . 
does anyone out there make toys to last with puppies ?  . 
i would not buy this and i can t believe they are still allowed to sell this . 
i chose this supplement because of all the wonderful ingredients ,  and i think that is all still great . 
we received this toy as a christmas present for our two year old who loves anything space . 
note that i didn t ever fiddle with the ends during normal use . 
this one batch made me wonder how bad the quality control is for these green cow products . 
it is very light and i can t use it . 
the combat is dull and not particularly tactical ,  and the graphics are pretty dated . 
to this day ,  the greatest football game ever made was tecmo bowl . 
my experience is that peanut butter has several things going for it . 
basically go straight ahead ,  picking off the enemies num_num at a time is a predictable manner . 
i have another case that works much better than this one . 
i hope ,  meanwhile ,  that now foods will take my feedback under due consideration . 
so it is a pretty watch but not easy to read ,  program and lack of light . 
and if you are thinking this reviewer must prefer espresso ,  not really . 
if we get it fixed ,  it might end up being something good . 
i bought this for my son for christmas when he was num_num months old . 
cable quit charging my iphone after only num_num uses . 
it smells bad ,  and the brush is kind of gloppy . 
i would not recommend this coffee if you like a good flavor coffee . 
however it does not sit flat on my stove top . 
easily the most comfortable headphones i ve ever owned . 
bought this for a small fortune ,  it works as described by others . 
i wish adverts would stop lying to us already . 
this is a simply stupid way to begin the game . 
talk about fun huh ? which is about the same as can be said for multiplayer . 
i realized after climbing up a veritcal hill you could actually drive off into nothingness . 
and it didn t look that good to begin with . 
now i won t be able to charge my nexus num_num during my num_num hour car ride  :   . 
i bought this item num_num months ago trying to solve my mouse problem . 
so i have been a long time user and advocate of the windows platform . 
you can purchase them in bundles and they re inexpensive . 
matter of fact it plays exactly like them almost . 
when in actuality ,  it probably wasn t previously priced for more than what i paid for it . 
the on and off switch is very hard to press and is located under a small rubber cover . 
i gave this a few tries and ended up binning the rest . 
they are positioned closely together so it s very difficult to turn them . 
cheap case . it starting chipping shortly after i got it . 
it is a shame ,  nupro is otherwise a great product . 
the water got sweeter  but grainer  and the scent got stronger but coffee did not . 
if you pressed along any edges of the screen ,  you d get that rainbow effect that lcd s produce when deformed . 
ether is a potent anesthetic which was used on humans in early medical procedures . 
with my type of soil ,  which is fairly common ,  it was basically useless . 
when you pull off the darts ,  it looks like a cat sharpened its claws on his shirt . 
the system does not accommodate runny poop well . 
the handle broke off the first pot after num_num months . 
i couldn t get it to perform consistantly at all . 
shoved all the way in ,  the rabbit ears were basically ripping me a new one . 
as a sock for  performance  these things sucks . 
it was quite obvious to see the blue plastic that holds the spout was cracked . 
zero stars for good investment in a toy . 
i tried to calibrate it ,  but that didn t help . 
this game has great voice acting ,  graphics ,  and plot . 
i had to return mine ,  but i was sad about it . 
i got an ugly psychodelic pink one instead ! since i ordered it ,  the photo has been taken down . 
i have several other linksys switches so i decided to pick this one up . 
it lived in a bin and was taken our only for something he wanted to take a picture of . 
and since i have a ph . d .  ,  i m leaning toward it doesn t fit correctly . 
so im sending it back ,  i don t know what else to do . 
i just had to go buy another one that actually does . 
the razor worked well for a month cutting as close if not closer than a blade . 
num_extend years ago when the company was still young and fresh the products well made and lasted way longer . 
and then try buying some trail mix and jerky and see how well it does in a test situation . 
i should have looked more carefully at the size . 
customer service sent me a relay harness for free  in exchange for good review  . 
its cheap the wristlet is like a little thread and not sturdy at all . 
when they fail ,  it should be to an open circuit ,  not a short circuit . 
worked fine ,  then the next week ,   disc read error  ?  wth ?  !  !  . 
not the kind of  dirt  flavor that rhodiola and other herbs have ,  but a distinctive chemical odor . 
oh well i sent it back thinking it is defective and i will update as times comes . 
about thirty minutes after drinking it i noticed that i felt a little less grumpy . 
i love how durable the material is and it is stylish . 
i complained to philips and they sent me a new one free that did the same thing . 
i have only had it three months and there is rust colored staining beginning to show in two areas . 
i bought the bread machine with the highest rating ,  so had high expectations . 
if you want to change the magnification you need a set of channel locks . 
i m about halfway through the game s single player ,  but i m not impressed . 
i just don t recommend this to anyone !  beware !  !  !  . 
i d rather sound better and not have as good noise cancellation than have good noise cancellation but sound crappy . 
they made the return easy and actually paid the shipping !  . 
so forget about using it to turn something heavier than a silver dollar pancake . 
but within a week this lil frog didn t last . 
unfortunately ,  for my circumstances i found it difficult to get the wrench to grip the oil filter . 
i do have other powergen products that haven t caught fire that seem to work well . 
it was the best but this new stuff is made in china and is garbage . 
the nice thing about these trays is they are fairly easy to use . 
it gets two stars because ,  if you want a black disk pendant ,  it s nice . pity . 
it was too tight and i couldnt use the top button . 
i thought this would be an interesting alternative but it tastes terrible . 
i m sure the postmaster general would have frowned on sending mold thru the mail . 
the other cars all drive on rails ,  irrespective of where you are . 
i was hoping it was just a loose flex cable but it looks like i ll need another replacement . 
leapfrog you should make a list of products that children on spectrum can benefit from . 
i love pacifica perfumes ,  however this particular one is a bit too sweet for my taste . 
i loved lunar silver star story complete ,  and i loved eternal blue . 
leaves greasy ,  gritty residue on fingers after two or three chips . 
the cusion is not really work for my back pain . 
i paid num_extend as much for this one ,  and it s not as nice . 
nobody would smell this and think of cologne or aftershave; it s not even in that ballpark . 
they were working fine ,  stuff wasn t sticking ,  and they looked great . 
it really had very little story line and the graphics were poorly done as well as the puzzles . 
but ,  when i received it and inspected it ,  i really don t feel confident in it . 
he was over zealous as the everlasting chicken treat was delicious . 
that s not enough of a savings in time for me to justify the difference in quality and taste . 
i suppose this cup is perfect for anyone who can guarantee that it will never tip over . 
it works well with any amp i ve tried it on ,  and you can find tons of great sounds . 
neither my husband nor i could get it to stay straight . 
maybe it wouldn t affect everyone this way ,  but i suggest being cautious about purchasing these  cloths  for bathing . 
the braun today is not the same as it was a few years ago . 
i assumed the other bad reviews were just flukes ,  i guess not . 
i think an organic trail mix would be a better choice . 
seems the plastic is super cheap ,  and that the lid doesn t always go on just right . 
i was all excited after reading the reviews . 
great concept but at least for my dog ,  it wasn t useful . 
when i read the ingredients on the can ,  i was very disappointed . 
good chance that you will get a crappy one if you order this . 
i read a couple reviews; and ordered based on the description and the color . 
num_num hooks ?  i have never seen such a thing . 
did not improve reception  metro los amgeles high rise office building  . 
but ,  again ,  stay away from the soccer version . 
i can t give it more than num_num stars . 
its also pretty easy and not very challenging . 
i have three boys and we all play online games with our pc . 
i normally purchase from an other seller but stumbled across these that were a bit cheaper . 
this makes my skin feel oily ,  makes me extremely shiny ,  and has caused me to break out . 
so far i ve tried num_num of them :  id millennium ,  swiss navy ,  wet platinum ,  and gun oil . 
as for effectiveness :  yes it does work on cats . 
the original is superb in the smoothness of the fighting . 
i like the taste and texture ,  and the three shipments i ve received have all been fresh . 
what s in that blend anyway ?  not working out . 
the first step includes a screen shot from a program that is not necessary or included with the product . 
it is just enough for a slender or small fish to fit through . 
poor quality  ,  plastic cracked the first day on both covers . 
i recommend picking one of their other designs . 
even if the energizers were being sold for $ each ,  i don t think i d go there again . 
pleats should fall accordion style  peak ,  dip ,  peak  . 
the blueberries are hard little rocks with a strange texture that isn t very appetizing . 
the scent is fruity ,  almost floral ,  which does not fit the pressed olive avocado name . 
this one has lasted the shortest amount of time . 
there s software that does it better and cheaper . 
i bought two ,  one for upstairs and one for down . 
i m a black women who enjoys my hair natural . 
the character models were great ,  especially in the cutscenes ,  and the environments were pretty . 
purchased this because i thought it would work better than my cheap screen protectors . 
she had been like that all day ,  i think . 
that being said ,  i had no problems getting the dough to extrude . 
but if it requires more current you ll see all sorts of unpredictable behavior . 
i am used to using the irock  a battery version with only num_num stations  for long drives . 
if you miss something ,  you have to walk backwards to get to it . 
and your electric fans .  .  . and running water .  .  . they all make reception horrible . 
there ya go ,  shadow has been a best seller . 
this protector is a sticky one ,  not that smooth as the screen of the phone . 
it tastes like a root beer gone flat . 
did absolutely nothing to give me better service . 
i bought this for my neice but she didnt use it . 
balls changing direction in mid air just so the receiver can catch it . 
not very appetizing or satisfying and i personally wouldn t spend any money on this product . 
i was so excited to get this mixer . 
i am going to try the num_extend stuff see if more does better . 
i guess you really do get what you pay for . 
it featured written instructions as well as instructions given on the dvd which was included . 
like the title says ,  the cases look pretty cool ,  but they don t fit very tightly . 
i agree with one of the other comments made ,  you are following a story . 
this did not work ,  there was no signal pass through at all . 
it took forever for the website to get up and running with the spelling word lists . 
what i recieved was two pair with zippers . 
even memorex num_extend burns at num_extend on my burner . 
we re going to try to return it ,  but aren t optimistic . 
it s time that companies like this taking advantage of heedless customers with shoddy merchandise be stopped . 
the two dollar can openers that are advertised every other place work like the should workl . 
so sad they sent me a size num_num when i m a size num_extend
the buttons are small and poorly located ,  after num_num minutes your hands get sweaty and sore . 
that s where its creativity should be abounding ,  not sagging . go rent eternal darkness and thief instead . 
my dogs just pulled this off the second i walked out the door ,  they hated it . 
i am going to return it and buy a pioneer which can play multichannel audio . 
this brand  physicians care  should be ashamed of themselves for selling this at such a high price . 
this is the third week i have used this product . 
i figured it was a fluke ,  so i allowed my terrier to play with the remaining num_extend
what s wrong with it ?  the question is ,  where do i begin ? the ai is retarded . 
the problem is what you do after they self inflate . 
i changed to hand washing with a very gentle soap . 
the best example of rancidity is brown rice . 
i will never give them future business !  tom . 
it kept aiming down at the ground ,  wouldn t stay up in the air for more than a few seconds . 
my dogs sniff it and use the bathroomon them . 
i won t throw them away because one of my dog likes them . 
i keep it out ,  just in case she changes her mind ,  but so far it is a fail . 
you may be doing others a favor too . 
ok ,  i have to admit ,  the price of this item did not have my expectations unfairly high . 
when i popped the disc into my num_extend expecting to be awed this game fell severely short . 
so far ,  still holding the seal ,  but they are getting progressively worse ,  so it s just a matter of time . 
one end goes over the tip of the bottom limb as most stringers do . 
i m a few years removed from college and had to cram for licensing exams . 
the entire dinosaur is too small as well and i was worried he would actually swallow the darn thing . 
lets just say the excitement was shot lived . 
this swiss chocolate is produced by kraft foods global . 
maybe it was our fault and you re not suppose to use this at such high temperatures . 
i didn t even finish my bottle before throwing it away . 
this is physics to a whole new level folks . 
people have also said that there is static when they talk to me as well . 
i threw the rug out and the cat is next !  ;p . 
some may say  you just aren t patient .   balonie . 
needless to say ,  she only got the real deal from me . 
unfortunately ,  it completley broke within weeks of using it . 
their telephone service system is so bad that it makes calling aol to cancel seem like a pleasant experience . 
plus it is less likely i can screw it up and kill my fish . 
the belkin shield is a good choice for an unobtrusive ,  pretty basic case for the num_extend
also ,  the lids for the new ones are extremely stiff and very difficult to get on to the containers . 
i bought this for the toiletries basket at my wedding . 
not one of their products lasted me more than num_num years and caused me a lot of headache . 
very boring and no practice of free will . 
i found this product to be totally inadequate for its purpose . 
this product is of no use to me whatsoever . 
i had to send it back with $ for repairs . 
i didn t even think it was the vitamins until i read another reviewer here . 
i have to admit ,  i have actually used this soap . 
the rod broke in num_num places on my first trip and the fish was gone . 
i guess i should ve read the reviews on this before purchasing for christmas . 
it did shed a bit the first time i used it and the first time i washed it . 
i couldn t even eat this stuff ,  i had to return it . 
i purchased this for my grandbaby and it was very tart ,  she didn t like it at all . 
it doesn t seem to do any better for me then a sponge with a scrubber on it . 
no wonder it didn t hold down the machine . 
i wanted very much to not spend the extra money . 
the developers are banking on their tried and true zelda formula to bring in the big bucks . 
there s no confusion in how you want to attack an enemy either . 
these are very comfortable and i love the wider toebox .  .  . there is no pinching or rubbing . 
i ve searched the customer reviews and this problem is not isolated to me . 
my closet was full of it ,  imagine the lungs . 
this is definitely not a suitable game for kids . 
then it started getting problems once every num_num days . 
the first game our three year old thought it was cool ,  but he hasn t wanted to play it since . 
a great watch sold by a awful vendor . 
rpg fans should really turn away from this . 
i didn t like this beef jerky much ,  especially the texture . 
hand washed and used these about num_num times now and they are splitting and discolored . 
after a while my daughter said  all done mommy  . 
from the description ,  i was expecting to taste something like chrystal lite . 
both are big fans despite the difference in gender . 
the bacon maker got grease all over the microwave . 
i wish that simple timers were all really simple . 
the usb was supposed to be new but it was not . 
note to self :  don t buy five containers of an untried food product . 
well just as with the emjoi i am disappointed with the results i get on my underarm area . 
you may like it because of your num_extend
my hair is not overly damaged but this product actually made it feel damaged . 
get that motorola and don t bother with this junk . 
even at one foot away ,  the audio quality was very poor . 
from a mechanical standpoint ,  this makes no sense at all . 
so ,  if you have good signal outside your home but not inside ,  this unit will probably help . 
the odor control is mediocre at best . i do not recommend this litter nor will i be repurchasing this brand . 
further ,  the ball joint deforms and becomes extremely loose . 
i bake daily ,  and was looking for a way to keep my work area neater . 
however ,  the perlite always seems to find it s way to the top of the soil . 
the cheap plastic paddle broke on the first batch of strawberry ice cream . 
the material this case is made of feels like it is covered in baby powder . 
lots of stuff feels tacked on and has an inconsistent art style that doesn t match diablo s polish . 
for $ what can i say ,  i don t feel ripped off or anything . 
my salon bottles always had a strong ,  delightful ,  minty ,  tea tree scent that made me feel invigorated and happy . 
the weebles are very heavy ,  so if they are tossed they will hurt someone . 
the remote has most of the its weight in the top half . 
it would only charge one device at a time . 
also with the num_extend ramekin pair sold by amazon ,  too . 
i feel they are cheaply made and will not last for more than a month . 
it was added to trick you into buying it . 
i will give you my num_extend one for free just contact me . 
the first time i used ,  or tried to use ,  this radio in a real emergency was hurricane irene . 
i used it almost daily to hold hot water for tea . 
however ,  this decaf does not have the same qualities as their regular green tea . 
i should have known better after reading the other reviews !  . 
thats not what i want in a scary game . 
you will die constantly because of the unpredictable movements and bad camera . 
they have a nice realistic sparkle and have the appearance of being  the real thing  . 
bought my second through ebay in num_num or num_extend
since i went directly to their website ,  i was responsible for postage . 
there is very little solo content in this game . 
then you can disconnect it ,  turn it on and it becomes a tiny wireless hotspot . 
if you intend to use them to accomplish yard tasks during increment weather ,  move on . 
ever since the battery was received ,  it has never kept a good charge on my cellphone . 
i did that because i heard that it is more complex . 
this worked ok til it stopped working at about num_num months num_extend month out of warranty  . 
windsurfing ,  kayaking ,  canoeing ,  white water rafting and the rest ,  be careful . 
the fun only lasted for at most num_num minutes . 
i was promised it would work by the item description and it does not . 
this is most likely due to moto s motoblur overlay on top of froyo . 
since they changed the packaging of the spray ,  i can t help but notice that this sweet taste is gone . 
makes my hair break off due to the water content which dries it out . 
the back end has num_extend ardent tubeless at num_num psi . 
these will not fit behind a standard wall mounted tv as such i have returned them . 
that s an awful lot of steps when you re like me and saving every couple minutes . 
priced well ,  not too expensive ,  but i will not get this again because the count is not equatable . 
when i eat food ,  my tummy puffs up painfully shortly after eating and i get crippling migraines . 
this watch doesn t use standard pins to mount the band . 
i d rather take a pill and get it over with quickly . 
the thermospot feature of this pan was my primary reason for selecting it . 
this is definitely the tea for you !  the clove overwhelms any other spice that might be in this tea . 
one week later ,  no dead mice ,  but lots of droppings . 
i m sending mine back to amazon as defective and picking up a uag and will try that . 
diddy kong racing ,  simply put ,  is a game i have tried to love ,  and simply cannot do it . 
these fit fine but are not tight enough to offer the compression i was looking for . 
players are rated in num_num areas specific to their respective positions using a bar graph for each trait . 
will send it back and try to get refund . 
if you have several ,  they do  harmonize  but not because they recognize the others . 
these are huge in size so go at least a size down . 
these aren t even worth the plastic they are made with . 
expect to shoot in the num_num percents a majority of the time . 
the only thing i can do with them is use them as cleaning rags . 
i actually prefer a ginger cookie to be like this though . 
here is why :  i estimate these num_num cup versions actually make num_num cups . 
i have owned this blender for num_num years and have always been frustrated with it . 
finally ,  the dice were a frosted look with light grey printing . 
then you will actually get the product you ordered and it is worth every penny . 
i have a num_num yr old aussie who is very protective . 
that way i can use these important accessories . if i crush my phone ,  i have insurance . 
this is the only one he does not play with . 
i was lucky i kept the receipts for the num_extend my vcr ,  and my xbox . 
it tastes more like passion fruit with a splash of coconut water than the reverse . 
i wanted to carry num_num guns in a more compact package ,  so i looked for a double sided case . 
i was very careful to follow the directions extactly . 
this should eliminate most of the confusion . there s no excuse whatever for these problems . 
other than that i will have to give them away . 
you need to educate yourself before buying shoes . 
but i consider only for that they work . 
first this item is too small ,  difficult to read . 
i am not pleased with the new soft rubber control buttons . 
i think the conditioner actually uncurled my hair . 
how sad is that !  ?  what a terrible experience . 
not !  so i had them replaced ,  just to get the same thing happening . 
it may work for you but did nothing for me . 
these are brand new and to already look tarnished doesn t fill me with hope that they ll last . 
this product usually works great but for some reason . 
they have provided control and protected from damage . the smoothing edges creme is not my favorite . 
about num_num days ago i bought the total exprience package and installed it . 
the blender jar leaks and the motor is breaking down after less than a year . 
quite frankly this is the last game i will ever purchase from them . 
this must be taken in the context of the phone it was paired with . 
and the edlund s are made in the usa and cost about the same as oxos . 
the spray adhesive also added a stiffness to the hat that i was looking for . 
unfortunately the sound was good but the headset was extremely uncomfortable and broke within a week . 
i am going back to my older plantronics headset . 
milk chocolate covering is probably the worst i ve ever tried . 
i didn t find it to be too particularly sour . 
this game is not the awful piece of junk which you are reading about in other reviews . 
it was a bit confusing to get so many parts in the accessory kit . 
now i m going to give you my reasons for buying and not buying this game . 
 if you are obese ,  it is not recommended to take skinfold measurements . 
the best way to describe this color is sheer with a hint of pink . 
be very very careful about plunking $ on this . 
i can repare it with a little glue ,  the handle came off . 
it s a pain in the butt for me and the other siblings . 
you can be killed in a single shot . 
i even changed the batteries and it still sounded horrible . 
why bring those fumes into your home if you don t have to ?  . 
i m a professional trainer and i do not recommend any pinch that has plastic nubs on the ends . 
what a waste !  !  !  !  i will get the vintage num_extend from the dms website instead next time around . 
they were ordered as student survival rations for a friends child . 
never had a wide tooth comb wrecked this much havoc on my hair . 
the concept of this is great ,  size and color ,  shape . 
real quality product and real leather at a bargain price . 
the rear broke off about num_num weeks later . 
that soft band does nothing to help it fit closer to the head . 
their bodies resemble statues and they stare vacantly into space . the graphics were pretty poor . 
i had them on for two minutes and decided they were going back . 
a few suggestions were to focus at num_extend then zoom to what i want and shoot . 
also ,  there is no real exploring of this game unless you are at least the level of surrounding monsters . 
i will add that amazon is an excellent on line company to do business with . 
this game is the worst of the three . 
so i had to go back to raid spray  that does not fail  . 
returning . the design ,  however ,  is lovely ,  i think . gonna stick with vs ,  i guess . 
i love my cats ,  but am so embarrassed about the way they wreck our furniture . 
had this in my oven for months and didnt really notice a difference with it . 
wasn t having nearly as much fun as with usual video games . overall :  this game had more negatives than positives . 
after num_num or num_num levels ,  i felt i was just doing the same thing over and over num_extend
keep some in the refrigerator for just that purpose . 
i was anxious to use the zaggsparq num_num since i travel and drag along a couple of ios devices . 
the high pitched beep from the contech spray can be annoying and unsettling ,  especially set off at night . 
my hair felt fuller ,  but that s probably because there was still residue in my hair . 
the thing is cheaper at the circuit city website . 
i waited an hour and tried his nails . 
i don t know which wireless router to suggest since i m only used the num_num and the num_extend
nomads have a habit of losing their hard drive formatting . 
they apologized ,  and made it sound like they never had one do this before . 
i don t want there to be a sometimes . 
thankfully amazon is wonderful enough to make returning easy . 
i bought a case of both the native forest orgainc asian pears and their peaches . 
it tasted like black cherry ,  was bubbly ,  and had a little tart character . 
i m returning this mouse in favor of a microsoft  egg  shape mouse . 
it s been too hot ,  too muggy and too rainy to use it much ,  but i m pleased so far . 
it is almost like a tall diaper pail . 
so it apparently it relies on internal pressure to make all the seals tight . 
i don t really like leaving negative reviews ,  but this wasn t very good . 
it even looks like pepper ,  and smells somewhat like pepper . 
i am never buying anything made by hoover . 
followed tips from other reviewers but still couldn t get it to work . 
as you can see above ,  the gamers are satisfied . 
i hunted down the package but alas ,  the number had been defaced . 
the only gun i like is the hardest gun to get . the story line is bland . 
my son gets bored with it within num_num minutes . i ll be returning this . 
if you are accustomed to pack walking your dogs this leash will do nothing for you . 
unfortunately it is very thin ,  and the curve is a bit too flat making a rocking cut more difficult . 
their forums weren t helping or their email or phone support . 
all i can say is this is a waste of plastic . 
it may be a fantastic antifungal in other uses ,  but this is one in which it fails . 
i guess it s a good thing i live in a family with money . 
in fact ,  i am sure it is suppose to even taste a little bit more bitter than lighter roasts . 
they re not at the level of halo ,  splinter cell ,  or orta  or ghost recon ,  or tides of war ,  or . 
i used it once and this went right in the trash . 
half way through the bottle i started to have major breakage . 
a lot of it is pretty bad and while it hits the action notes ,  it just doesn t work . 
after messing around with the video settings i got it to run decent . 
it just doesn t hold much . read the dimensions carefully . 
on the other hand ,  you will always get your hands wet using mag float cleaner . 
the clamp part should be a little more tapered close to the handle . 
i used to wear this when i was num_extend
if your dog is even moderately rough with his toys on the other hand . 
they have a very nice look .  .  . just not comfortable . 
it lasts forever ,  just a little is enough and it was perfect for liquid foods . 
just like another poster here i loved theanine by itself . 
i m happy to have found a good use for them . 
it takes forever to heat up and melt cheeses in this as well . 
nothing worked exactly as it was supposed to . 
i ll stick with my clarks model levee bank pump ,  it fits correctly without this goofy heel issue . 
save your money and find another screen protector !  . 
the bristles are rough and come apart easily . 
this item was sold as a belkin gold cable . 
the box ,  itself ,  is about an inch and a half deep ,  so the slightest jostle mixes everything up . 
the clothing sucks so bad in this game . 
with my new antenna ,  the radio was doing a better job scaring me than helping me talk to people . 
i m glad i purchased them before the prices skyrocketed . 
many of the tasks are really simple and does not keep your attention so it gets boring really quickly . 
it is not a true num_extend camera; it uses software to obtain the num_extend advertised resolution . 
they are unbalanced ,  which is compounded by the perfectly round handles . 
these taste okay ,  but have a really ridiculous amount of sugar . 
to be fair ,  the case will protect your phone just fine . 
i know that nothing lasts forever ,  but i really expected a lot more from a brand with henckels s reputation . 
to be really useful you must  imo  have the full set available in several forms  see below  . 
the ground meat feeds into the tube at less than a snail s pace . 
i can t leave it on if i m in the same room because it drives me nuts . 
my sister is a num_extend so that s out of the question . 
the positive i took away from this was that i really like magnolia scenting . 
i emailed pet naturals twice asking about the propionic acid and never received a response . 
never had a screen protector scratch at all more a less so badly . 
my internet provider asked me to contact manufacturer for help . 
i got these to supplement the num_num devacurl clips i have . 
it took me a few days to  connect the dots  and i finally remembered the review i read . 
i went through half the bottle and then went to the vet . 
i treyd it my wife tried it and it does not work . 
wires are not long enough to accommodate it elsewhere . 
 i have a fifteen pound gut that needs to depart soon  . 
however ,  the fit is so loose that it comes right off the phone . 
my cat ate the first few cans i put down then refused to touch the stuff . 
not the white i wanted but platinum blondish . then i used this  lavender  to do streaks to frame my face . 
will have to wait and see how well it ll clean up with the silver cleaner . 
that s all there needs to be said about the hopper . the doser on this grinder is a nice feature . 
my taylor has been in aquarium service for num_extend years now and have only replaced the battery once . 
my skin feels oily versus moisturized and i really don t care for the sunscreen smell . 
i was rather pleased in the beginning with the case ,  the feel makes the ipod very comfortable . 
if you want something that helps lashes get fuller ,  longer and stronger buy rapidlash . 
i was hoping that they would take forever to chew and keep these pups quiet for a while . 
how this would fit any large revolver with a num_extend barrel is beyond me . obviously this thing is cheap . 
there are extra  underwires  on the sides of cups . 
i ve used the num_extend btu burner to fry fish in a wok ,  and it s more than powerful . 
first they say no ,  then yes ,  then guess what ,  no again . 
all i did was press a whole bunch of buttons . 
they look like used one and made of plastic . 
spyro uses fire ,  ice ,  elctric ,  and bubble elements . 
i ordered this product in early sept .  ,  gave it a good review in the beginning . this is not sterling silver . 
i am extremely disappointed to get such a bad product for this much money . 
i also loved the amount of space for the amount of bio media you can put in . 
shame on tidy cat and amazonfor offering a product to consumers that is dishonest and deceptive . 
i regret ever buying them cause now i have pants i will never wear . 
this is my second comment on this card . 
the front wheel bent after not even at least num_num uses . 
i had hope for better considering the ratings .  .  . oh well . 
i also bought another jw toy with this same purchase . 
the battery compartment is very deep and extremely snug . 
there are better cases for the money or a little bit more . 
so you can t go into radio shack and get a replacement . 
these armies can only be used on certain maps . 
i have four different ssscat cans that i place around the house . 
they are simply telling it like it is . 
take it from someone who has very sensitive facial skin . 
another nice fellow but i cannot understand his accent . 
maybe wash your car with them or feed them to animals ha ha ha .  . but they don t seem like food . 
when i saw this game i bought it without batting an eyelid . 
this cable appears to be of good quality . 
secondly ,  the pictures are boring and there s very little interactivity at all . 
it s possible that my facial breakout may not be acne . 
so when my brother told me about these ,  i got all shades of excited . 
another shorcoming of this unit is that there is no dc adaptor plug . 
the guys in marketing got me this time . 
it also didn t really feel like it fit my phone very well . 
turning the gears doesn t make the music turn on ,  or make the balls drop . 
i cleaned the surface of my dash ,  which is like the picture and coarse and it fell off . 
i have purchased num_num elbows and now num_num locks . 
i removed and reinserted the battery three separate times with the same result . 
spend your time hand cleaning them and you may not get rust . 
i really didnt expect these glasses to be high quality because they were very cheap . 
both units are on their way back to amazon . com as i write this review . 
and ,  the more they bend ,  the more flexible they become . 
yes ,  it holds the scope on there .  .  . sort of . 
i ve discovered that this game is intentionally incomplete . 
i threw it away after using it a couple of times . 
i didn t use except during the winter too which makes it even worse in my book . 
right out of the box there were many sighs of frustration . 
didn t work at all for my two feuding cats . 
it sounded like it had gotten sick if that makes any sense . 
it made the radio from bad to unusable . 
i tried fixing it but now my phone gets stuck . 
the sunscreen doesn t fully rub in ,  leaving a white film that makes my skin look ashen . 
my dough can still blow out during a high speed mix . 
this stuff taste horrible ,  i even got a little sick from taking it . 
i tried adding a bit of soy sauce ,  and a dash or two of chinese five spice . 
he couldn t walk yet ,  but he was already too tall to really play with this toy . 
after trying it ,  the laser was all but useless at the range . 
all i got was a coupon and there items are higher than amazon wants . 
i m a fifty year old woman and i have pretty good skin for my age . 
but of course ,  it s being priced like an aid kit of higher level . 
these pants shrunk quite a bit on the first wash !  concerned they will be to short soon . 
i tried increased doses of these with no results whatsoever . 
the small viewing area defeats any benefit of added magnification . 
when filled with cds ,  this binder would weigh a ton . 
if you wanted to create ships that looks like the ones in star trek ,  you could . 
i don t know what i m going to do about a remote . 
i tried num_extend and got hardly any flavor . 
i find the arm holes to be too big . 
if you have been playing games for num_num years ,  don t get this game . 
i did not get one good use of it . 
this also has a huge clumsy ac plug which is unnecessary and a waste of precious plug space . 
no big deal as its only num_num dollars but even so please don t waist your money . 
too many bad things are coming out of this pet food company . 
my daughter hates this toy ,  she cries every time it moves . 
even at that ,  a scratchiness is usually present along with the whistle . 
i think it was close to num_num of the num_num pieces that fell into this category . 
this was the first one of these i tried . 
save your money to buy nice moisturizers and serums for treating and controlling your skin issues . 
i was mislead there is not battery included with this just a silicone case . 
they do not cover the entire screen and the cutouts are in incorrect positions . 
unfortunately ,  shiny entertainment couldn t hack the matrix ,  and neither should you . hope the review helped . 
my num_num pit bull barely fit into a size xl . 
after a week ,  i got a terrible sinus infection . 
not only that ,  but the yellow color was so bright that it stained my clothes it touched . 
the pieces are all very small and hard to keep up with . 
i just hated this phone it was a piece of crap in my opinion . 
i know a lot of people like this product ,  which is why i got it . 
if the audio gizmo you want to use these with doesn t have good bass and treble controls ,  tough . 
 .  .  . read many of the reviews and ordered it . 
when an arbor will not fit into the bore ,  it doesn t matter what laser insert you try to use . 
i gave up and went to the bose headset ,  which works much better . 
of course ,  there s a battery indicator that should have alerted me to this so i could change the battery . 
i put this sugar in the raw in the glass . 
it is unhumane the way they are killed . 
if i wanted to drink fruit juice ,  i would drink fruit juice . 
they said i could pay them $ for a  refurbished  exact same model and send them my old camera . 
if you have a life of your own you won t enjoy this game . 
with two exceptions  very cheap $ ones  they were fairly worthless . 
let s get this out of the way first . 
if you are going to use this kit ,  do yourself a favor and use a lot of loctite . 
the product goes on thick like glue and crumbles wasting some of it . 
there is no way it would slow down her eating . 
i promptly packed and shipped back to them with tracking . 
i removed the screws ,  removed the bend and fix it up ,  but its of no use . 
right now trying to find a work around . 
on my num_num the trackball is farther away and i don t have the cursor jumping issue . 
i m amazed at the rapid response that amazon gave to my problem ! denille . 
barlean s has a good name and i hope they can correct this problem . 
i have yet to try slicing anything else because i m so discouraged . 
you have to buy the dromadary bag for this . 
we ve had what ,  one hundred years ?  ,  to make and perfect wrist watches . 
i think young girls would enjoy this game more than boys or adults . 
i also have not seen any real improvement in my skin at all . 
i m sure it was great but that is not the case anymore . 
way harder than a fluval num_num and at times those can be hard to prime . 
i never made it past the second level ,  which is a real shame . 
so ladies ,  for this type of investment ,  we can t afford hair that sheds and tangles . 
the bottom compartment was a complete no go and the main compartment diameter was still too small . 
if you don t need to warm up the bread or rolls ,  then it s too bad . 
the sterling silver still looks good after a few years and the emerald cz is also nice . 
i really wish it had lasted longer since i thought it was a fun toy for my dog . 
this is a review of this product : men in black ii :  alien escape  playstation num_num video game  . 
it s just a piece of plastic like screen scratch covernot highly mirrored as pix . 
pretty much the entirety of the nightmare that is  ghost and goblins  . 
it is really a great deal to get num_num cans shipped for this price though . 
worth less than the $  after redeeming my otherwise useful amazon dividend  i paid . 
he is not a chewer ,  thank goodness or i fear this mat would not last etc . aug . 
needless to say ,  we are using other batteries . 
the sm rep assured me that there was num_extend coverage in my area  determined by zip code  . 
my previous ones separated and food would get inside .  .  . pretty gross . 
when i finally got the package it was folded in half with tire marks all over it . 
got this in the mail and the seal was broken . 
hormonal birth control is not good for your body either ,  so i tried to go organic . 
the camera angles and the gun control that drake has is just terrible . 
i have had this mill for over a year . 
it looks cute and when one pulls it its eyes close and open . 
i didn t like the touch screen ,  so most of the features didn t do what i needed them to . 
since diva cup is reusable ,  instead is much more expensive in the long run . 
the party finds out about these rocks that augment your power and magic ability . 
lot s of memory ,  good screen ,  handy controls ,  good bundled software . but last week it didn t turn on . 
the rear sight fits the desert eagle mark xix just fine ,  the front sight does not . 
i don t expect shin megami tensei here or anything ,  but at least something respectable . 
looks good until it does fall apart but puts you through the ringer swinging all that thick dull weight . 
consider spending the extra money if you are looking for quality . 
the material was itchy ,  uncomfortable ,  and didn t seem to flow very well . 
see you all in wow my bloodfin peeps !  !  !  . 
i found no noticeable boost in energy levels after consuming this beverage . 
if any of the producers took a moment to see what their customers wanted  i . e . 
i would not buy these balls for practice balls or anything else . 
the lack of coverage of the most vulnerable areas of the droid makes this a  why bother  item . 
good on promax for producing a healthier version however . 
save your time and get a $ trident silicone case . 
we re changing two cats over from dry to canned cat food . 
i should have known better than to buy this . 
the signal processing takes place in the unit ,  not the pedal . 
amazon sells both ,  but you can get the chocolate mix on sale for about $ in a grocery store . 
i ordered a similar product about a week ago ,  and it works flawlessly . 
i bought this for my three cats; they were interested . 
i m not even certain that it s spill resistant . 
the short sword with the long blade s gun small gun part fell off . 
within one day of use one of the plastic screws fell out . 
they re just rip offs from previous final fantasy characters . 
a cheap $ generic cable will work just as well . 
in the picture of these insoles the blue top liner appears the have the metatarsal arch pad . 
i have a road bike with presta valves that needs num_num psi . 
save your money and take num_num focused regular deep breaths to the abdomen ,  that works . 
sony has a model with push button stations ,  and better reception . 
there was no dripping down the back of the throat or bad aftertaste . 
these are the first blue tooth anything i have purchased . 
on this one ,  the phaser i sat crooked ,  and the sound effects worked only intermittently . 
this bag looks exactly like the picture ,  so there is no deception . 
the only reason i kept it is because it was a gift for my girls birthdays . 
i had to leave it on the street because it became an useful piece of china junk . 
i would not recommend this unless your dogs are outside dogs . 
for a product that claims no residue ,  it didn t live up to hype . 
inside the second canister was a filmstrip ,  which sticks out of the metal canister like a tail . 
it fits the phone ,  but has a crappy ,  cheap feel to it . 
if it was stronger i would recommend it but until then go find another product . 
i love the script that is on these pieces but i will not wear it nor will my husband . 
these do give you a little boost ,  to me it felt about the same as a cup of coffee . 
i ve read that this game is comparable to past zelda games . 
 this is not ,  as a few have written ,  a difficult camera to learn to use . 
the wife doesn t like it when i m cranky . 
the unfortunate reality is that the more recent canisters have been shipping with defective pumps . 
it s one of those  good ideas  that eventually turns out to be dumb and overly complicated . 
i am returning this ball and getting another one before i fall on my butt and hurt myself . 
both cases are very similar ,  other than color and rear molded design . 
i love broccoli cheddar soup ,  i eat it all the time . 
i have not had this happen with other screen cleaners . 
and sat there for five minutes with my hand on the burner before i gave up . 
it s not really something people should be consuming at any level . 
i think silver biotics works better than mesosilver . 
the game employs a drop down menu to issue command to your character . 
it works and the price is not bad but low quality turns me off .  . will not buy another . 
i have sensitive skin and it didn t make my skin look any better . 
this has virtually no healing powers at all . 
i just us the power outlet from the wall now . 
and impress me it did ,  and i don t even own a num_extend  my parents do ,  though  . 
cds stored beside these in paper keepers were not damaged . 
at almost $ a bottle i thought it expensive but i was willing to give a chance . 
to sell such a thing for $ is laughable . 
first of all ,  the drink slogs down the throat like so much melted fruit matter . 
now i have two bottles and a wasted $
i know it probably sounds pathetic but i really did have a heck of a time with the bottoms . 
the pair that i just ordered from amazon has this same issue so i have returned them as well . 
the previous pot i had was made in america and lasted close to num_num years . 
works ok ,  not much spray time and my dog quickly uses it up . 
i think it s the fishy smell ,  which is very disagreeable . 
the fitment to the power supply is there . 
i ll try introducing it before the new little one is walking . 
so ,  let me just say that i am not a novice to homemade ice cream . 
i m sending my back ,  they are not as advertised . 
for the plastic to split tells me the material may not be the best for this product . 
in my opinion ,  this system was not needed ,  and was only produced because of the num_extend and num_extend emerging . 
num_extend num_extend case has started to come apart at the edges revealing some yellow plastic card . 
the magnets on the sides are coming off . 
and then there was the bug that stopped me . 
the speed is super slow which i can not stand it . 
the lubriderm one feels much better on ,  less greasy for sure but it s a chemical sunscreen . 
you must think of every one in order to succeed . 
never got to use this item as it never arrived . 
however ,  the foam did not come out in a stream as shown on t . v . 
she liked the noises it makes but its a solid hard plastic that she couldn t grip in her mouth . 
it is still working well but it will make a constant mess until it wears out . 
this game has me thinking ,  there not lot thought how it can be played . 
i like my shoes to have a little wiggle room in the toe box . 
very difficult to use any side buttons covered by the case . 
silly me ,  i assumed the seller would have fixed the problem . 
he said i would be better off replacing these speakers and to try another brand . 
my dogs were not that crazy about these ,  they are small and to messy for my liking . 
they fit small and dig into my heels . 
if you re seriously stressed this product most likely won t cut it . 
however ,  what they claim is a headphone port does not fit any standard earphone jack . 
it is a shame as i really need it and was desperate to make it work . 
i guess i shouldn t have expected much from a $ item . 
for one thing that i don t like about it ,  it is the size . 
i will not be purchasing this one again . 
that type of thing seems to be missing in twinsanity . 
if you die three times your done for . 
but over time ,  these cheaper connectors will tarnish and audio quality will drop off . 
i recently used the num_extend model charger on vacation and it worked !  !  hope that this helps . 
and now i m noticing that the projected image is blurry on anything past six power . 
one had a tiny fleck of something inside but could only be seen objective first . 
this does not . it s a good thing it has that nice ,  comfy oxo grip . 
i played the mulitplayer download of this game and was not impressed with anything it had to offer . 
he loved it so much he destroyed it in about num_num minutes . 
i gave it num_num stars because of the sound . 
the super nintendo version plays a lot like the arcade hit . 
good sound quality and easy to use but lacks features present in others . 
i have no idea why nobody else has mentioned this issue ,  because it is a big problem . 
hopefully this was just a dud ,  but i was really unhappy . 
pet pectillin is vanilla flavored and my two cats with severe diarrhea absolutelyrefused to take it . 
when it came with a bunch of poles ,  days late ,  i was incredibly annoyed . 
i usually wear a num_extend but sometimes taking a wide . 
and they are not cheap . i would never purchase these again . 
there s just not enough cheese powder in here to cover the amount of pasta in each box . 
there are much better and higher quality facial creams out there ,  for sure !  . 
the socks look great when first taken out of the package . 
pc gamepads suck compared to the concole gamepads . 
i ve been though a lot of personal cassette players ,  from the most expensive to low end . 
no fault for the vendor ,  but it was still useless to me . 
even when standing perfectly still ,  lights came out as streaks in the background . 
the scent is hard to describe ,  but had a chemical kind of scent to it that was just awful . 
i have never found a top coat yet that keeps nail polish from chipping . 
the main trick is though ,  not to get your hair too wet . 
i was very disappointed in it . if you feel like trying it ,  go ahead . 
it doesn t fit as well as i would have hoped . 
i never go to return this item since i waited too long to return . 
overall ,  it is just not a good comb and i will have to replace it . 
if i am broken out ,  the cleanser stings my skin . 
but my num_extend old loved it because it was a train ,  and not just any train ,  but a thomas . 
the price seems very good ,  and i hope that the card has arrived and works for my son . 
i think maybe my high expectations were the issue here . 
many times the warning has only provided num_num or num_num seconds to slow down . 
my wife and i opened another can of this soup and weighed the contents . 
there do not seem to be any player awards at the end of the season  e . g . 
i love almost all of my thorlos ,  but these gave me blisters . 
they are one of the most unreliable ,  and most expensive forms of data storage i have ever seen . 
and a bit of cinnamon .  . ahh lovely way to start the day . july num_num follow uphave had this for several months . 
iphone is the best ,  next num_extend and then droid . 
hard to handle; have to lift front to drain; make a mess . 
that is not the quality i was expecting ,  especially from melissa and doug . 
num_extend steam  may the company rot in hell  is required in order to play the game . 
i thought it sounded great because i have fibromyalgia ,  and arthritis ,  and bunions . 
stay away from this head phone unless you likewasting your money . 
i d be surprised if oster really makes money on this one . 
i didn t see any benefits from taking it . 
this stuff is very subtle providing a light sheen wherever applied . 
i think i will be cleaning up vomit soon . 
it has no glide . now i use it for the body ,  after adding few drops or aromatherapy oils . 
these were very expensive when they first came out . 
then the container jammed in place and couldn t be removed . 
no better or worse than any other optical audio cable . 
we used a prong collar for a bit ,  then replaced that with a harness lead . 
that is ,  it is functional most of the time . 
to what extent ?  its great horrendousness ?  if that is the case ,  then yes . 
you ve been cautioned !  ! as far as taste of the product ,  it left a lot to be desired . 
even if it s really ,  really ,  really good sound quality . 
good luck trying to fit two in there . 
there s little reason to need that speed anyway ,  as most internet connections are far slower . 
they use it sometimes ,  but they were always in it when it had fleece inside . 
as per the norm ,  you get far less than your money s worth from these cheap belts . 
i think these headphones are a joke and happily i bought another pair for num_num that are good . 
if some faults are ok ,  you can save a little money on this . 
i read all the reviews thinking that it was great ,  as many people said . 
the base bends ,  at the handle base ,  when pressing . 
if you are looking for a great case for your ipod touch num_extend away from this case . 
anyway ,  to their credit amazon responded immediately to my email and is sending me a replacement . 
 :   i do not like it sam i am . 
it makes me not want to buy cat food from here . 
i ordered a couple of different outfits for my dog . 
i d like to return it ,  i ll print up the return form and send it back . 
please note that the  turkey  recipe contains significant and very noticeable amounts of fish . 
note that it was not abused in any way ,  it sat in back of my computer undisturbed . 
i sigh quietly and explain  one more time  that i have already upgraded the firmware . 
to me ,  it didn t have half of the flavor that i was expecting . 
got newtrent to replace these but only to have the same thing happen . 
another item joins the ranks of failed camera equipment in my dead camera junk bag . 
or maybe they aren t bugs ,  just bad design choices . 
i did purchase num_num orders to give it a fair try . 
my computer exceeds all requirement of the game and still this game really and truly sucks . 
the color is extremely patchy and i somehow missed a ton of spots . 
the pump dispenser is the reason for the num_num stars ,  because it is convenient . 
i use the sprint phone and will try some other batteries . 
i am a num_extend and this thing made me looked like a stuffed bratwurst . 
the unit doesn t really chop nor does it grind . 
i wasn t letting her just  chew  on them either . 
this toy needs to be revamped and made as one piece or better construction . 
i won t buy them or anything else from the same vendor . 
the second one died the same death a month later ,  just in time for my christmas pies . 
the natural bristles do have a fairly distinct odour ,  but i m sure this will pass with continued use . 
it is very pretty though and appeared as shown . 
also ,  the snaps in the front were uncomfortable and itchy . 
it is not at all as easy to use nor is it as boyant as one would think . 
i skipped halo num_num and went right to halo :  odst and enjoyed that . 
however the real problem is that they scratch so easily . 
my husband being handy said he would try sanding down the rough edges . 
i am num_extend num_num lbs and the extra small was a little loose around the waste . 
looked cute with my daughters halloween costumeconstructed very well for the price of the item . any one would enjoy it . 
unfortunately ,  all three channels had static in my house . 
also ,  kitchenaid can handle a bit more volume . 
good to have these building pieces to work with . 
the worst part is the age old long undewear problem :  they won t stay up . 
i can t imagine that it would last very long . 
when i attempted to perform the copy from within num_extend it took another num_extend hours to complete . 
you can t see this product at all ,  it makes almost no color . 
i sent them back and got an amazon credit for the full amount . 
i wanted this to work so badly since it s natural but it didn t do anything for my acne . 
the replacement head does not properly fit the toothbrush base . 
difficult to put on ,  so they were returned . 
will try to send back ,  and now for a few more words . 
are you kidding num_extend months !  bring manufacturing back to america where people actually care about the products they make . 
it had the samsung logo but everything else was in chinese . 
again ,  uneven and the polish would not dry . 
also the material is similar to polo ,  lacoste . 
also appears ea has giving up on the game . 
it worked with the iphone but didn t work at all with my blackberry . 
don t expect too much and you won t be too disappointed . 
it did a fantastic job ,  but the device was an extra $ i wasn t expecting to have to pay . 
num_num of us tried for about num_num minutes to get the truck bed to stay ,  and it wouldn t . 
still looking for a replacement for the old spatula the puppy chewed up . 
if you become to corrupted  it s a second bar above your health  ,  you just die . 
so ,  for num_num more calories i ll stick with my usual brand . 
sometimes ,  and this is one of those times . 
i don t need num_num words to say that this product stopped working . 
regardless this is one of the best for my skin and surfing ,  one of the champs alright . 
i had to unplug it for awhile ,  then reprogram . 
again ,  i only finish num_num chapters in this game and i m not impress . 
and to make matters worse ,  after only one washing the material has not held up well . 
the motorola elite headset looks great and has great features ,  but also completely died . 
loved the way it made my hair feel but not worth having to replace so often . 
even upset my stomach when empty and you re supposed to take before a meal . 
a very similar issue happened with the hp i replaced with this kodak . 
it was a bit loud when on the highest speed and the blue light was annoying . 
the item is cute ,  but my birds had no clue what it was . 
i will probably sew it up and see how long the material itself will last . 
what s the point of using this ?  for that ill just wear a better moisturizer and be done with it . 
i went on line and read the reviews and although all were num_num star each one mentioned the odor . 
the hose is a joke; it s way too short . 
a lot of these criticisms apply to samsung as well ,  though android can be secured with proper setup . 
we have other infantino puzzles that we really like ,  purchased num_num years ago . 
my hair was not left feeling exceptionally clean or smooth . 
cheap piece of crap that may have damaged my piggy s stomach  if he ate the silver ball  . 
i m very disappointed with the design of the new cup . 
i am allergic to dairy products and thought that this would be safe . 
they have a strong ,  fake cheesy ,  chemical flavor and odor .  .  .  .  . maybe from the plastic the product is microwaved in . 
largely because the game is one of the most lackluster video racing games ever . 
didn t stay inflated right out of the box . 
unfortunately the center button was broken off the top of the hat when i received it . 
too long ,  heel to toe . so they went back . i m sticking with the premium hanes socks at target . 
sound quality reminds me of a transistor radio as opposed to decent headphones . 
i had a very difficult time getting it back off and no instructions were included for help . 
what a waste of perfume !   :   even though it is a great idea ,  i would not recommend this product . 
i don t know exactly what i was expecting ,  but this seems a little skimpy for $
i even went to my eye doctor i was so concerned . 
however the fan motor broke after about num_num months . 
i had purchased and worn another pair ,  but lost weight so was looking for a smaller pair . 
it absorbs nicely without any perfumes or smell and more importantly no sunburn which is dangerous to my health . 
but !  the moment i started to use it ,  i noticed the sluggishness with this mouse . 
back it went in favor of the body beautiful camisole sold on amazon . 
every num_num to num_num min you start to hear a bit of distortion in the station . 
also the locks were quite uncomfortable to use . 
coffee was quite dry when i got it . 
for customers ,  we use hp jetdirect ,  which is expensive ,  but works reliably . 
this product was a waste of money and a big sticky mess . 
this item does not have enough leverage to flatten the dough all the way . 
first i must confess that i have wanted a stand mixer for years . 
i love the idea of vanilla scent but when the package came ,  i was so excited of using it . 
i ve had better luck with my ionic hairdryer ,  which keeps the hair silky and soft . 
this product just doesn t do anything for me . 
i would recommend you take both ingredient lists into your own ophthalmologist to examine before using this product . 
the crevice tool does not lock when extended and of course can break easily . 
i bought this for a gift and it was dead on arrival . 
this and the mint julep mask break me out like crazy . 
you really have to dig the hearts out of this ,  to get them to go on nails . 
there s not much physical or mental skill required . 
i cant complain because i didnt pay much for it . 
wow ,  for the price ,  you figured you can get a few years of use . 
if you are a prospective buyer ,  i d go for one of the more expensive and durable models . 
although this case may look nice and sturdy . 
this lock is flimsy but you might get lucky ,  i bought num_num of these already . 
i wanted a nice solid black that was shiny and this wasn t it . 
they treat their customers like pieces of dog poo . 
every time i smell it ,  i feel myself involuntarily getting that  icky smell  face . 
every time i use this brushes ,  bristles are left on my face . 
well lets just say that i am still using the dryer sheets . 
there is nothing wrong with the way this product tastes ,  but it is difficult to cook with . 
overal ,  not worth the extra $ i think a more resonable way to get nonstick is hard anodized stuff . 
finally ,  these bras seem to have little to no elastic in them . 
if you die ,  you have to start from the very beginning . 
everything checked out ,  but i could not get this thing to work . 
this presents the problem of the coffee cooling as you transfer it from the bodum press to another container . 
anyways ,  this bone does not hold up to his aggressive chewing style . 
thus i present my experience and my solution . 
the problem is ,  it doesn t do much else . 
i would think that would help the chances of mucking up the screen . 
and it works the other way ,  too :  as a defender ,  i intercept passes i have no business intercepting . 
that soup offers more flavor and comes in a much larger serving size . 
one of the main games is to simply find hidden baseball cards . 
it worked so well when i tried it . 
i m planning on suing bsn for this crap they sell . 
invested for nothing  it went to the used game store  . 
even if it did ,  having a little one attached to your xbox is just a waste of money . 
i am not sure why this product has so many stars for it . 
i sleep fine in any bed ,  with  or without  any pillow . 
i bought these for him because he has a lot of foot pain . 
so i thought i would upgrade to the shure or etymotic . 
i put them on and listened to jango on my toshiba thrive . 
but she must because any sick moment ,  that s where she goes . 
save yourself the aggrivation of returning an item . 
these were still too narrow even though i ordered a d . 
i remember the broth being thick and creamy ,  the dumplings had perfect texture and size . 
i had to reboot my note num_num by removing the battery all the time because of lock up . 
in about num_num months ,  that start of a healthy nail growth had fully grown in . 
it even failed at that as it produced a minute amount of bubbles and they disappeared quickly . 
the tongs are mainly for use of smaller tasks ,  and not heavy meats . we thank you for writing to us . 
though the manual was missing from the package and i have yet to find it online . 
i m writing amazon for a refund after my review . 
it s large ,  very slow to warm up and makes horrible ,  tiny creations . 
i am back to watching from the ipad . 
upon reading other reviews i placed order for this unit . 
my son is num_num and loved playing with it while i was assisting him . 
i may have just been sent the wrong . 
they did not fit my dog s feet well ,  and need some type of sock or liner . 
while the remote feels solid enough ,  the different sounds it makes are of terrible quality . 
i have not written a review for bras until now . 
i found this product to be to much glitter and i returned it for credit . 
im not sure if i just received a bag batch but i had to put on two per injury . 
next time ,  i will pay more and get totally bamboo products . 
this one did not work for me ,  but that doesn t mean it will not work for you . 
strangely ,  i think it would actually be a better drink if it was diluted by half with water . 
i was hoping for more body since this product is supposed to enhance curls . 
parts of the rubber has also chipped off from finger nail catching it while removing from pocket . 
and if they can t find the location of the device ,  then it can t find me either . 
after that it is more drying than anything . 
that sucker was hot .  .  . as in burn your skin hot . 
it s too bad to because they really pumped out some good heat on high . 
because of this ,  i am switching over to the drinkwell system . 
super mario num_num was a launch title and it had way better graphics . 
the sound quality is ok ,  sound level is on the low side and some noises from time to time . 
i was not expecting it to be so bright . 
i thought i just had one of those bad guns . 
i can honestly say that it did its job . 
another reason why i was sure that it must be really a six count . 
but ,  sometimes ,  they can irritate the skin ,  but electrics can too . 
in terms of how it works ,  i didn t find that it helped with my hair s dryness . 
my son requested this for christmas of num_extend
this is a total waste of money ,  it s absurd they charge this much . 
i felt bad that i had paid $ to view an ad for matrix num_extend
for the money ,  it could a whole lot better . 
circa num_extend and still king of the hill . 
this headset is used primarily for voice recognition dictation with nuance naturally speaking num_extend
is anybody there ,  does anybody care ?  i would guess not !  don t buy this cheap product form this company !  . 
we have a chihuahua and she loved playing with this toy . 
this hat has no stretch in it so i did not like it . 
but it is same as any other instant noodle and tasted very bland to me . 
we tried it with juice and could hardly drink it . 
the ai is absurd to say the least . 
they need to be recharged all the time and pretty much stop working after a couple months . 
these have a very odd taste ,  all chemically . 
i got a size num_num and the foot and opening fit great  with an insole  !  !  !  . 
why doesn t kodak sell it along with camera itself  ?  after all it hardly worth num_num bucks num_extend
we loved the look of this set and received it for our wedding ten years ago . 
playstation had a game just likes this and it was called goo goo soundy . 
i can t find any reputable retailer with the batteries so i m sending it off to casio now . 
unfortunately ,  body slams don t play too much into this game . 
a dog that is basically easy to control would probably be fine on a gentle leader . 
at that current the regulator chip inside gets hot ,  but not too hot to continue functioning . 
i won t recommend anyone to get this game . 
at first i thought this game was really cool when i started it but it soon became too frustrating . 
it splintered and gave me a nice gash on my left hand . 
it does seem to be sturdily made and a clever idea ,  but i can t use it . 
this one was enough for about a week . 
like i said ,  the arcade version was alsome though . 
i will always remember the very first crash bandicoot game as being this uninteresting ,  frustrating experience . 
i thought there is nothing that i can use or do will ever correct his behavior . 
i purchased this toy after seeing it recommended in a magazine for christmas gifts . 
i bought this unit as a second humidifier . 
what a waste of my num_num dollars .  .  .  .  . never buying anything from them . 
but ,  it is fatally flawed with a lack of orginality and low replay value . 
 bottom line  :  i do not recommend this brush . 
the flavor was not as bad but it had some aftertaste to it . 
i m sure the size was provided in the description ,  but i must of missed it . 
this product resulted in more constipation compared to using nothing at all . 
i have had hard cases before that have cracked or broke ,  so i wanted to try something new . 
the straps are bad ,  just some padding on nylon straps . 
my leatherman has a more substantial saw blade . 
i have a jayco jayfeather num_extend and the hitch is such  wide and high  that no locks fit it . 
if you have an older cat ,  i m not sure i d even bother trying to convince it to wear this . 
the consumer has no way of knowing which menaquinone they re getting . 
i would guess i maybe used it num_num times total . 
horrible ,  even with the manual arrow icons on . 
switching between computers is never a problem as long as they re both awake . 
first issue when taking out the pieces ,  it s a weird mix of plastic and wood . 
i pressed the pieces on as tightly as possible ,  to eliminate the gaps . 
all of the gripping surfaces are slick ,  slippery and very poorly num_extend
i purchased this item after experiencing a similar item at my hair salon . 
a seam just suddenly has a big gap in it . 
however i bought a $ ge flat panel antenna at target ,  and it worked much better than the rca . 
i haven t used this hose other than for watering plants outside . 
when i removed the lid with the holes ,  she was able to go and do pee inside . 
my primary complaint is that it is too thick ,  especially on the sides where it curves . 
i know exactly what they look like ,  how they should sparkle ,  and what the color should look like . 
i noticed nothing all day but i did not feel poorly . 
you can t clean it once stuff gets inside the clear case . 
i like caviar ,  but this is some of the worst i ve tried . 
artisticly this game is amazing ,  but the game design is very ,  very boring . 
i read good reviews on this product ,  so i thought i d give it a try . 
even then i had blurry and out of focus shots . 
when it does not open completely ,  it springs back . 
did i mention trickery ?  how about bait and switch ?  please save yourselves from my mistake . 
i installed the battery ,  programmed the keypad and put it away . 
maybe safer to put in the luggage compartment of my car and lock it there every two weeks . 
i need al the support i can get . 
this coffee grinder grinds my beans very quickly and it worked well for my french press . 
if the temperature does not rise by num_num degrees in num_num minutes ,  it turns off . 
first you really have to make sure you get the right sized harness . 
i m very disappointed with this model and will be returning it . 
junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk !  . 
don t waste your money unless you re really skinny and have only a belly . 
jumped on amazon and within seconds i came across this gem at a good price . 
pretty sure it caused my face to breakout so i stopped using it . 
but as of now ,  this game just sucks . 
shortly after i got it the pearl fell out and it was gone . 
this was one of the least played with toys we ve bought . 
the graphics are awful and looks like it came out of the garbage . 
the antec notebook cooler has a more durable aluminum top ,  ergonomic shape ,  and more quiet design . 
my daughter initially loved this dollhouse ,  but after a few weeks she lost interest . 
i did not want to try and affix it with adhesives . 
i in fact bought it for that reason . 
overall ,  i give it num_num stars out of num_extend
should i feel better after taking it ?  i would think so ,  since it s called liquid nutrition . 
eden foods has been using bpa free cans since num_extend
it was well made and would probably work ok for a large dog . 
the other just for some other miscellaneous micro to mini conversions all of which work . 
it s back to the drawing board for me . 
i have purchased other belts that are in the same price range ,  but are of much better quality . 
that makes the fountain tip to one side . 
it keept time pretty well for the months ive had it . 
it has a sensor on the underside that senses when something is underneath of it . 
i am now required to carry the skillet assembled to avoid further damage . 
now i come to my biggest complaint when it comes to pvp . 
i ordered these leggings and in about a week they were already ripped . 
you could speed up or slow down ,  but only temporarily . 
it really doesn t do anything but become somewhat gummy . 
for those with diabetes and those with edema or swollen feet . 
need the whopping num_num calories this juice box of water will provide you ?  ?  eat a breath mint . 
finally ,  we got it to slide out but it would not go far enough to secure the safety lock . 
i was not able to use this product . 
well ,  this didn t actually calm her down ,  and it gave her terrible diarrhea and vomiting for a week . 
sharpkut ii knives are made in the usa and don t rust . 
however ,  the catch is that the radio chatter sometimes provides key mission updates . 
they hang straight and look fine for work . 
i waited till aug for the dog days of summer and i have a non airconditioned area . 
well i put the batteries in and they lasted a total of four locking and unlocking of the car . 
both companies are held in high regard when it comes to the fighting genre ,  but capcom vs . 
my girls had only put him into a sitting position and they start to pop off . 
lightning hit near our house and the motherboard plus router got fried . 
after this ,  i may never try another brand . 
he pulls it right off as soon as i put it on . 
i d chalk it up to individual bad luck if so many here hadn t reported the same problem . 
my heart just hurts to know i buy organicthings for my son . 
obviously a smaller ,  thinner mount with a heavier phone ,  but it is very distracting . 
this is not the first time on getting old food . 
since i ll be eating the whole box it s good that there is something good i can say about them . 
i ran my num_extend marathon in which all that was available was heed lemon . 
the metal letters almost immediately fell off the back of the case  within a week of receiving it  . 
it s a shame because i thought this game had potential . 
it is a plastic piece of junk and the pieces are very hard to put together . 
this happens to work because i own the stuff already excepting the pin . 
however ,  the thought still lingers of how i miss the oldschool rpg s . don t get me started on the story . 
somehow ,  this one takes that system and just makes you lost . 
this bag alone is heavy and simply does not offer enough padding and does not hold its form well . 
i don t know what people are talking about when they say the chocolate flavor is awesome . 
at almost $ a box this is an expensive snack . 
with children s scissors i think it s always a balance of safety vs . 
i love roasted seasoned seaweed ,  so that isn t the reason ,  just so different then expected . 
you would tap a key and indy would swing num_num degrees . 
please review side effects of this product and use with caution . 
i am hoping it will regulate my periods . 
this is a great idea especially if you don t have much room . 
and each time i was told to do the same thing :  install from the cd . 
my havanese had it torn apart in less than num_num minutes with stuffing all over the floor . 
the bars themselves just don t suit my tastes at all . 
all the cons with this unit were eliminated with the jabra supreme . 
it s also heavier because it s not pyrex anymore !  after num_extend when corning glass stopped making pyrex . 
i bought this after recovering from breast surgery ,  and it s not soft ,  it s got seams that hit me wrong . 
not a month later a piece had come off the new one . 
very strange since the other colors were not like this . 
sadly that was one cliche that was not forthcoming . 
these are terrible beads with quite a few misshapen and faded or ugly coloring . 
call quality has never been a huge problem with the other high end units i have used . 
sadly ,  it was not . specifically ,  the concentration of pigment in each color is very low . 
the curls weren t all that defined in some spots ,  and some had a crimping spot from the little clamp . 
you and your partner will find yourself in a world completely full of pokemon . 
this knife has a belt clip ,  but it s too big for practical carry . 
so we re going back to the coffee maker we were using before receiving this one . 
the manufacturer claims this will fit a sig num_extend
the notion of evolution is so complex and could make for a really smart ,  engaging game . 
just because the list of ingredients seem natural does not mean it is  healthy  . 
i gave the product num_num stars on ease of use and how well it dyed my eyebrows . 
fit is ok but quality is below average . 
the fabric is of a very poor quality and tears easily . 
i ordered these thinking ithelp save some time decoration . 
i would not recommend this product to anyone . 
the enemies are far more powerful than your team ,  and you are almost always outnumbered . 
wth ?  ?  ?  ? i ve used a few other jarrow formulas and they are fabulous . 
i can t raise my wand hand above my head to mist tall trees and objects . 
my urgent advice is to stay far ,  very far ,  away from this game . 
apparently i have to pay for it anyway . 
selectivity is ok for this type of set . 
i think this brand is good for the severely allergenic ,  but ,  alas ,  the taste isn t like regular granola . 
i d just say stick with the old trusty than going fancy  !  . 
once the initial excitement wears off ,  you come to realize that this is a bit bland . 
sure ,  it s lightly carbonated ,  but that alone doesn t make this drink a soda . 
i shampooed ,  and on my newly clean hair i applied this . 
you simply cannot type fast on this keyboard ,  the keys are too stiff and stick somewhat . 
i told them i did not care what headset i got as long as it worked really well . 
my feedback is honest ,  i don t mean to hurt the seller . 
i like to test the latest sports supplement or product . 
she can smell the kibble ,  but won t play with it . 
don t buy !  i wish i could return it . 
it looks just like the pm indicator which is to the left of the display . 
and this same case is like $ in the store . 
i ll finish these off and look for another poduct that does the same thing without the aftertaste . 
the only way to unlock more cool sets and costumes is to keep playing and researching . 
now bear in mind that my cats are not only curious ,  but very determined . 
when i tasted it myself ,  i felt like doing the same . 
otherwise you risk buying fake ,  old ,  or tampered product . 
i purchased it anyway and i received it in late february . 
there are a lot of other cards out there for less that does essentially the same thing . 
after contacting ati and fiddling around with software drivers ,  etc . 
i had long ,  porous ,  color treated hair and this towel was a waste of money entirely . 
the next night ,  again we re woken up in the middle of the night . 
the fabric and size of this hair towel is the worst i have ever used . 
the sound quality and streaming for music is good . 
the genuine dried berries are very nice ,  but they ruin the cereal with a ton of sugar . 
i just wasn t happy with the fit for my ear . 
large gap between top of stairs and the higher mattresses . 
yes ,  there are extensive settings in the driver software to fine tune some the actions for your personal needs . 
the idea was to make it more convenient ,  not make it strategically more challenging . 
it is hard to coordinate the train going around the track and the oversized crane . 
i ve had the controls freeze up so i can t move while people are firing at me . 
this sock is all bottom and no top . 
motorola even had to delete the threads from their support forums to save themselves from the embarrassment . 
tried sharpening but due to the half serrated side it really never sharpened well . 
the real sonic complete channels the energy to the brush head . 
if something happens to change my mind ,  i ll update my review accordingly . 
there are plenty of better games out there . junk !  . 
since i had lost the receipt ,  i had to call it a wash . 
i tried to find accessories for it  like a case without messy velcro  and could not find anything . 
i was excited about this game ,  at first . 
i bought this unit at amazon . com in early october ,  num_extend
they are created with rollerblade style wheels that are a good combination of silent and durable . 
it s not what i thought it was going to be . 
totally too small for anything ,  nicely made ,  but as i said not for anything i need it for . 
so i replaced my inexpensive splitter with this fancy shmancy one and . 
this unit i purchased for my mom was problematic from day one . 
and incidentally ,  it s just as useless for eyebrows . 
i found it was fun for just about num_num plays . 
the other problem i noticed was that the sender temperature probe was way off in it s temperature reporting . 
my daughter who was num_num at the time got a real kick out of the game . 
they also are made of a very scratchy unfriendly duck material and have defective seams below the fly . 
so i m not sure if i want to give them to her anymore . 
i d say they are not designed for long conversations !  other than that they are okay . 
also i m not too sure about the color for my skin tone . 
i purchased it banking on that it wouldn t freeze like others said it did . 
it is ok to use as a regular comb for a short haired dog . 
they both stopped working after a short period of time . 
jamal lewis retired after num_num seasons in the league . 
i liked the amount that s in this packet . 
the market lacks a good fitting cover for these air conditioners . 
the anode was poorly manufactured and had a slight bend in the shaft . 
the timer beepers are so very annoying i just replaced it with a different brand . 
make sure you can get a refund if you buy this product !  . 
often these foods are dead by the time they are packaged and this tasted like like dead peanut butter . 
my internal system seemed to have a problem processing it . 
this pickup grabber is a piece of crap . 
the us voice for this product is horrible . 
even though the company s website has a form you can submit to ask questions ,  they never responded to me . 
they don t protrude from your ears ,  so you can probably sleep in them if you want to . 
so i either have a defective splitter or it just does not work . 
however ,  the taste is not one ,  for me anyway . 
for example ,  waving the remote in the air will result in link performing the same move with the sword . 
we got this to clean up dog accidents . 
i own many dickies products ,  but these are far too tight in the crotch . 
i have read all of the wonderful ratings about this razor i . e . 
they fit wrongly ,  was not very happy with them ,  it is hard to find the right leggins ,  especially online . 
that s a nice touch and all the human characters have english voices . 
it took a tool and two people to separate that . 
i m not sure which of these things caused my dog s skin conditions and i don t really care . 
it looked gross !  i had to pierce the upper hard wax layer to reach the cream beneath . 
i love the features and optics of this camera . 
this product may work well with aqueon products or more of a european curved tank . 
it includes a dial that allows you to make weak ,  medium ,  or strong tea ,  and that s all automated . 
she had it about a week when it got knocked off the kitchen table and hit the floor . 
do not waste you time buying this soup . 
these shirts are too tightly woven and heavy . 
i needed a dryer just to keep at our cabin ,  so i wanted something cheaper that still worked well . 
i will probably just put a standard sigg bottle cap on it and use it for backup . 
sprayed on damp and dry elderly shih tzus who have had long standing itchy skin issues . 
the bottom line here is that this product just doesn t do what it promises . 
this made my face break out and it clogged my pores . 
this year payless did only the black ,  white ,  and some other bright colors . 
i don t know if this is just an issue with my particular iron or with this product in general . 
however ,  the plastic sleeves make it easy for the clamp to rotate on the frame or seat post tubing . 
had to tape them down with gaffers tape to make them safe . 
if the baby was in the crib ,  she d urinate in the crib . 
i have it for over a year and i tried to use it once or twice . 
i have this ,  and honestly ,  it does nothing for me . 
my thumbs were so red from trying to put it on . 
you can easily move the timer an hour ahead without realizing it . 
i really should have listened to the reviews . 
no matter what i ve tried ,  i cannot get the cat interested in this one . 
this would be good for your num_num year old on his first boyscout camping trip but thats about it . 
he didn t even get into the little nub that reviews indicated was a hit among other people s cats . 
i think the buttons didn t work at all . 
i ve purchased a hundred products from amazon and this is the first one that is a complete fubar . 
i had completely tightened everywhere i could and it hung off of her . 
sony s memory is slow ,  but at least reliable . 
seems a little too childish for a num_num year old . 
this splitter is ok if you couple it with a toslink amp : digital fiber optical  toslink  signal amplifier . 
i just chucked what was left of it in the trash  after less than a year of ownership  . 
i took this stuff to the worst area  the sun room  ,  and dumped a lot . 
everyone that cares had all sorts of remedies to recommend . 
the ones i ve checked out in stores didn t have the receiver out and showing . 
amazon sucker me by selling this in a combination  ,  i didnt see it had very bad reviews . 
i have never smelled a worse smell in my life than this product . 
 i finished the bottle .   i also didn t notice that it did anything for me ,  other than give me heartburn . 
this one showed a noticeable improvement in reception of weaker stations when the amplifier was switched on . 
it highlights on the front label that it contains no aspartame . 
it is adequate as a back up shaver only ,  perhaps for your gym bag . 
so ,  i just stuck with norelco as they did an adequate job . 
i cannot believe i bought this after reading reviews stating exactly that . 
it did not remove my eye make up . 
certainly ,  shorter levels would have literally made for a shorter game ,  which is usually a bad thing . 
invariably ,  it goes in crookedly and allows coffee to spill . 
i thought this ball changed colors while my dog was rolling it and playing with it . 
it only charges my iphone num_extend at % battery level . 
i am giving these pads one star for the following reasons . 
you re simply trading blows with them ,  and that s not good gameplay design . 
i got the battery and it seem to drain faster the the oem one . 
i don t know why this tape measure starts at an inch and a half . 
unfortunately ,  i had to stop taking this product . 
my husband does all the laundry in our house and he really didn t like these . 
i purchased num_num of these and i no longer have any . 
i contacted them about this but they never replied . 
now i don t know if i should trust if they are any good . 
you only get a hint of the flavor peach . 
i purchased these speakers about a year ago . 
the pills that these probiotics come in are huge . 
i ve played the num_num version and it was fun . 
a pristine hatchet says the same thing about a person as a spotless pair of hiking boots . 
the eye cream was definitely sitting on the shelf for many years before it was sent to me . 
i put in the sightmark num_extend boresight and peered through the scope . 
i didn t really like this color or the feel . 
the decorations are nothing more than thin cardboard and stickers which peel off easily . i don t recommend this at all . 
at first it would hold charge for at least num_extend
i have been purchasing this product and it is perfect for my needs . 
the package is very appealing and the aroma from the drink is divine ,  but the flavor was mediocre . 
the other users should  key word being should  have read only access . 
this is the most boring game for game boy . 
so i can t review it and its performance because i never switched it on . 
i give it num_num stars because it works % of the time . 
i would think this would be very unsafe for some people . 
and let s face it; the writers didn t want to make a video game . 
this ball was in pieces in fewer than num_num hours . 
i don t usually use a car charger ,  but got in just incase . 
also notice in the picture the battery has num_extend  wich is original manufacturer  ,  yet the one shipped is num_extend
cured my fissure in less than num_num weeks . 
even estee lauder and others have done it with their products . 
it was so bitter i almost couldn t drink it . 
for that ,  i ll definitely order from them again . 
if you re accustomed to cereals with added sugar ,  you might find it bland ,  but i love it . 
i was so excited to get this set after reading the many online reviews . 
looking up and down is a chore . you use num_extend and num_extend to look up and down . 
after being pulled aside with several other giggling women ,  i realized there are quite a few women like me . 
but it is dry and doesnt go on properly . 
however ,  the trouble begins when wearing the ear buds . 
i could not even bend the indure a little bit . 
buyer another western like red dead revolver instead ,  one that does not have this foolish glitch . 
not sure why this is marketed as mtx as it only fits on the post mounted rack . 
really really hard to get on and off especially after sweating . 
it s hard to latch and doesn t stay in position well . 
guess i can wear them in the garden . 
the hat comes out and whatever else you wash with it gets tangled up in the ball cap buddy . 
with what was provided ,  i am not impressed but maybe the flavor needs a chance to be savored . 
after you stab this glowing symbol enought times it will magically reappear at another spot on the monsters body . 
oxo has a good reputation for ergonomic products . 
they will do nothing more than take your money . 
it is amazing the amount of flexibility in labeling standards . 
i did not find that rich chocolatey taste i was expecting . 
please take my advice and research before you even think about anything associated with braun shaving . 
zero improvement in colors ,  so maybe i had good  old  lenses to begin with . 
what s up with the description of % buyer beware !  . 
this game has chosen to take away everything that has defined it for the last num_num years . 
there were several negative reviews for this and i have to add mine . 
don t even need to shake it ,  just turn it over . 
had it been priced at $ like the old num_extend series games ,  i would say it s a good game . 
this product did not work at all and with multiple ethernet cables and computers . 
i tried rubbing it in my hands with a bit of water as suggested by another reviewer . 
never gone anything longer because i d just give up and end up taking laxative . 
you get what you pay for when it comes to items like this . 
did not want to take any heavy medication ,  so was looking for something to take the edge off . 
i have no idea why this one works so horribly . 
i ll be giving this to goodwill or a needy college student . 
therefore ,  i was unable to complete the last couple of tasks and finish the game . 
this device does not cancel out background noise . 
but amazon was great as usual and the return was easy !  . 
if i don t catch it the kettle boils dry . 
alot of hairdressers claim that loreal is one of the harshest dyes to use on your hair . 
purchased this from amazon and it broke within num_num months . 
i use many proraso products ,  but this one was a disappointment . 
i was very wrong ! now one must understand that cutting our cats claws is no easy task . 
it was not ,  and i was told it was still on back order . 
not a good treat for allergy dogs ,  especially if there is the possibility of food allergies . 
super glue held it momentarily ,  then broke again . 
it has always been a reliable product and i have used it very well . 
i don t like anywhere near this much vinegar . 
maybe my dog s case was more elevated than this product is meant for . 
i always wanted to play a game like civilization that had great diplomacy and a . i . 
the biggest pain about this product was trying to figure out how it went one after taking it off . 
i heard it has cancer causing chemicals in it . 
i can t brush though my hair at all . 
creature of kapu cave is next but i m not optimistic ,  nor should other veteran sleuths be . 
i found when i opened the box that cuisinart changed the model . 
the pad is very noisy and doesn t seem to get very warm . 
it s hard to set the times ,  and half the buttons don t work . 
until a few days ago ,  i had almost waist length hair . 
if your an adult that likes building jigsaw puzzles ,  then this lego package is for you . 
there is nothing fresh or real about these . if you are looking for something similar to fig newtons look elsewhere . 
it stinks on my num_extend quality is okay ,  but nothing special . 
i purchased this for my daughters new iphone num_extend
 most of these  mature  gamers are in their teens ,  oddly enough . 
he has signal issues at his house as well and it didn t work well for him either . 
after about num_num minutes i was still staring at the screen ,  clicking on various things . aaaaalright ,  i ll take the tutorial . 
this one actually has all the problems with a bra that i ve been trying to avoid . 
plus it does make some popping sounds even on brand new records . 
my tile is a smooth surface but it has little dips ,  gentle little dips . 
my cat wasn t very fond of it even before it broke . 
ridiculous !  they went back . the material is incredibly thin . 
i was introduced to avon through a friend who sells it . 
i thought would be a box of num_num at least for price . 
they might look good on paper and for price ,  but these are not usable . 
very expensive for a bunch os plastic that sits around . 
if you want num_extend to num_extend sound then you have to use analog plugs on the back . 
product arrived missing the green num_num grit stone . 
if you need to fix a broken denture i would recommend taking it to someone that makes dentures . 
takes up a lot of space and would be better if it were collapsible . 
trust me ,  i had to learn that the hard way . 
this was a lovely offer ,  and perhaps it works better on larger animals ,  but it doesn t faze raccoons . 
this tastes more like a combination of pear and pineapple juice ,  with a slightly gritty texture . 
would rather pay more for something more fun to play with . 
i just keeping hoping it doesn t explode every time i fill it with hot liquids . 
what in the name of creation led to the production of this revolting pile of poop . 
which is it ?  if it s num_num speed ,  the seller needs to change the title . 
they are not as good as the spigen brand . 
according to bold games tech support they re not going to release any current patches to fix the problem . 
not sure what else there is to say about it . 
it as if this stuff absorbs all the odors they come in contact with . 
had these headphones for a year and then static started coming out of the left ear piece . 
my daughter ,  for example ,  just didn t like the noise ,  even at the quieter setting . and my son . 
the shaft of the boot was too narrow ,  and i couldn t get my foot into the boot . 
however it is smelly ,  hard to pour from ,  and doesn t have a very rich feature set . 
terrible customer service and rude man at repair center . 
well made ,  but the connection is a littke weird . 
i really love the fit on these but sadly the soles fell apart within a few months . 
i tried it with three different macs ,  connecting a lexmark printer . 
not a favorite . the disappointment came when i didn t get the strong scent after lighting the candles . 
i ended up throwing both kits away after about a week because we simply couldn t do much with them . 
cables arrived on time ,  however ,  they were only num_extend not num_extend as stated in the product description . 
i have frizzy ,  wavy hair and this shampoo did not make my hair soft in anyway . 
this game literally spits out  sometimes  the butterflies within num_num seconds and it s over . 
this bag doesnt smell like coffee ,  it smells burnt . 
i thought i was better than the other reviewers and make this work ,  but it s really not possible . 
otherwise ,  this product works quite well and has held up for over num_num years so far . 
most missions are so easy to complete with the starting units you are given . 
i have no problems with the graphics ,  the entrances ,  or the sound in this game . 
i dont think it is authentic !  my sister sends me fresh herbs and this one is odd . 
however i live in the dc metro and fresh coconuts are not exactly cheap . 
i was very disappointed in this product for my droid . 
this game ,  while a decent port from the ps version as far as a port goes ,  is very frustrating . 
these trophy things sound horrible ,  are hard to play ,  and really aren t worth buying . 
disappointing and makes me wonder what s up with bali s sizing . 
i was thrilled with it out of the box when i saw how well it cleaned . 
this game was an extremely easy game that you can beat in num_num minutes . 
backside coverage is good ,  but the front rise is far too short . 
looks almost like gym chalk spilled on the sidewalk . 
i love that game ,  loved it when i was a kid ,  and love it today . 
he is a chewer and has destroyed many cords by chewing them in half . 
i come across some motorbikes ,  they make noises . 
it s actually the same engine tecmo used in dead or alive num_num for the xbox . 
this one cooks the kernels and many don t num_extend the stirring arm is flimsy and cheap . 
this product seemed to be sealed fine ,  but the salt inside is very wet . 
my cats love toys and like other products such as the turbo scratcher . 
the consistency is way too thin to be a shampoo . 
however this bag is very large ,  to accomadate the num_num sections inside the bag . 
as soon as i use one of these then it s back to freezing and restarting . 
so basically you get num_num games in num_num with num_extend
i end up pulling out my ratchet kit every time for serious jobs . 
i bake constantly and i have never had any problems . 
so ,  i m baffled why people say it wouldn t go on their rods . 
a real mood killer while playing any game . 
the outfits are ugly ,  and the green makes me sick . 
one stand can t fit all instruments ,  but my full size guitar stands hold most all guitars . 
i got this just to try something new . 
if you aren t too picky with your self tanners than this is a wonderful product . 
its more like a car tire rubber than it used to be . 
we have a set of melissa and doug upper case and lower case letters bought in december num_extend
i open the case and my head hurts from the plastic solvent or monomer residue . 
i d say that was a reasonable price for this item . 
do not buy for rv usages unless you will only be in cooler climates . 
and the battle system is awful as well . 
the big difference is the cultures that are added to produce the various types of cheese . 
a cheese and noodle casserole known as makeroullini is recorded in a great britain cookbook in the num_extend century . 
i bet i couldn t sell it for $
weird it seems as if motorola is buying stuff and placing their name on it and calling it good . 
the vertical pieces are barely tack welded on ,  so they broke easily . 
the accompany needs to do something to make it keep odorous down not mask it with lavender . 
i don t want another of these but may end up with it anyway . 
i don t always want to use a num_num cup bowl ,  but i don t want to clean num_num bowls either . 
it seems ocelot was purchased by valeo  in num_extend
kids couldn t wait to get this once they saw the commercial . 
more or less underwater soccer with cheap rules and unrealistic physics . 
odd thing was the coffee carafe was only half filled up . 
rex is definitely cute ,  but his roar is more of a strangled squeak . 
i hate to say it ,  but this is where capcom should call it quits . 
item in picture is the larger model not this one . 
with other good choices out there this junk simply isn t worth your time or money . 
during the times i used it would charge extrememly slow . 
lets face it ,  you can ,  if you so chose to ,  put a library of congress on these monsters . 
i used this for the full amount of time . 
it s useless to me !  wasn t a bargain or good deal afterall . 
the stainless steel strap is already sporting some scratches ,  but i don t mind it at all . 
no place in the description does it mention you cannot use these as snap caps . 
expensive ,  yes but worth it as an investment in the pet s health and well being . 
you have to actually disable and then enable num_extend to wake it up . 
i tried using this soap and broke out all along the perimeter of my face . 
bought to save money but used twice the amount . 
the backing could not even withstand pressure applied to close the snap buttons . 
the first splinter cell that came out for num_extend is better than this one . 
on a positive note there were no issues returning it . 
this dock works great with my num_extend as it is compact for easy storage when i m traveling . 
bottle ,  and although i probably have quite a bit left ,  why bother ?  it s done nothing for my skin . 
the medium bag easily fits a tube ,  bike multi tool ,  keys and a cell phone . 
this design is not going to hold up over time . 
it just made a class that could have been a lot of fun a chore to play . 
pecans ,  the best nuts for pies ,  candies ,  and other culinary delights . 
the quality is not as goog as expected a $ num_extend
it s annoying to activate things just by trying to get it better situated in your ear . 
the heavier hamilton lid is very flexible but somehow survives the dishwasher without any softening  unlike the oster  . 
i d even pay more to have it better quality . 
i put this on and it was like i was wearing a sack or something on my chest . 
most people imagined that after ocarina of time ,  majora s mask would be all that and a bag of chips . 
and i ve got a lot of the stuff ,  and have been generally satisfied with it . 
there are several major issues with this version ,  as well as some minor ones . 
i can run it over my lip and it will stain parts and kind of run off of areas . 
i was excited to receive them in the mail and quickly noted the super high quality construction . 
i love the idea of juicing and i wish i could recommend this juicer . 
will try again as this product is well made and wears like iron !  . 
so ,  i oiled the blade to see if it made it any different .  .  . nope . 
so ,  can t really heartily recommend this for most skillet cooking occasions . 
it still gets hot ,  and flashes the lights of doom . 
after a few months ,  it just stopped working . 
we don t want to hide our experiences . now on to the experience . 
if i d known that ,  i would not have purchased them . 
this may be a great product ,  but good luck choking it down if you have a tendency to gag . 
from there it was just a matter of making a character and starting the game . 
he was fine ,  but i was worried about what could have happened . 
i passed up the klean kanteen brand and chose the new wave instead because of price . 
i bought this a few weeks ago ,  and had very high hopes for it . 
what was the company thinking ? you should see the video clips of the game ,  your gonna lagh out loud . 
konami never should have put these two weapons in the game . 
i waited too long to return this ,  and now i am stuck with it . 
i always put it off for another day . 
i guess this amplifier or whatever you may call it works . 
this does have its interesting moments ,  but it zaps the replayability to num_extend
i wish the darn handle on it didn t break ,  though . 
these cookies taste dry and stale ,  they didn t do anything to help my appetite or my weight loss . 
i got this for christmas num_extend months ago  and the finish is already coming off . 
when i open the bag up half of it was crumbs and some whole pieces . 
save your self frustration and time and just spend a little more and get an oem battery . 
it is probably more suited for num_num or num_extend
she didn t even try to figure it out . 
it does what it s supposed to do ,  leaves my hands clean but the smells leaves something to be desired . 
these pants are a stretchy material and you feel like you re wearing leggings or a girdle . 
i bought this thermometer after our glass ,  analog pampered chef one broke . 
the end cover opposite of the charging side of the battery is loosely glued on there . 
then i contacted the manufacturer and they said they don t support combo devices with this remote . 
if you have a large head ,  be warned !  . 
first of all ,  i want to praise this game for the beautiful graphics and design . 
you could moisten them and smash them together but way more work than i was willing to do . 
however ,  i found out a way to work around it :  connect the ipod to a powered firewire hub . 
i already had one gift for her and i wish i had skipped these . 
one serving is a brief squirt or teaspoon of mio . 
ridiculous the stuff had no smell or color and i could a swore it was just plain water . 
together the people can control the market for our own good . 
i received a beige slip . not what i ordered ,  problem not corrected . 
when i visited my mom ,  she asked me when i washed them last beacause she could barely breathe . 
two stars because it still has the benefits of coconut water . 
i would have thought more from panasonic ,  but for this it is worth looking at something else . 
it seems there is a problem with the capacitors that i did read about in a few reviews . 
what were they thinking ?  this isn t a final fantasy game . 
i talked to ati ,  and they told me to do a few things ,  make it work better . 
however ,  she liked the peanut butter for about num_num minutes and then she was done . 
if they get thrown ,  they could do some serious damage . 
if there were an option to choose the color and length ,  i might be more happy with my purchase . 
like new condition ,  not when the lens hood has deteriorating gaskets and the autofocus mechanism is not working . 
the picture looks a lot like the one i use to have . 
it is vert mushy and not worth the effort . 
here s my take on nst :  this is a very nice ,  but very limited reader . 
unfortunately ,  once it came off its hinges  which was shortly after getting it  ,  it never stayed in place again . 
my niece ,  age num_extend is a south paw . 
so buy num_extend and expect them to last somewhere between num_num and num_num days . 
this was the second invicta watch i bought and returned . 
so you ll have to click on the tiny corners of the cell and manually delete num_extend
ended up with my face breaking out all over from the open pores getting infected . 
my boys got this for xmas last year ,  so it s seen about num_num mos of play . 
its not fun and its nothing like before . 
it broke the num_extend time i used it ,  and i am gentle with these things . 
in num_extend both the armors look too specialized ,  and that s exactly what they are . 
i paid almost $ a bag and only received one usable bag . 
as is ,  two stars ,  mainly for the horrible mouth feel . 
i need something for her kennel ,  so don t really have much of a choice but to deal with this . 
then i have to crush num_num or so more . i m getting something with a much better mechanical advantage . 
i still use it but i have to keep heating it up . 
you need to get money to get clothes ,  to swing better ,  to get more money ,  etc . 
i am having a hard time figuring out to consume this product . 
ok now they ve done something you never seen before . 
we had to pour in hot water so that it would allow us to take a warm shower . 
they even look like they were made for men with skinny legs . 
i need num_extend for my scale and couldn t find it in the safeway . 
to be replacable memory card ,  replaceable battery is mostly a useless feature . 
i have to admit that i adore revlon s colorstay liquid foundation . 
i use it with the apple cider vinegar . 
the sock heel is under my heel . they are very snug and almost uncomfortable to wear . 
maybe other products from neutrogena are great; but this one was a mistake for me to purchase . 
i was amazed at how quickly it dried my hair and how shiny it looked afterwards . 
i gave this product a one star because the case is not the correct case for my phone . 
i wanted to try this before i passed it to the kids . 
i also did not like the fact that there was not volume control and the caller sounded extremely loud . 
there is a noticeable amount of play between the ring and camera body which i found unacceptable . 
if you want to get your computer to get broken or get a hard drive problem ,  get this game . 
this toy is so expensive and yet so cheaply made . 
i was thrilled when i first bought it . 
would not recommend this product or purchase it again . 
if they have ,  then i whack the outside with my hand to loosen them . 
these nuts  cashews ?  ?  ?   are soft and borderline stale . 
wax all over my floors ,  counters and cabinets . 
i have a num_num acura rsx and these lights look identical to the stock headlights in the car . 
save up an extra num_num or num_num dollars and invest in something useful . 
a pure piece of junk !  !  !  don t waste your money here !  !  !  . 
story is exactly the same ,  graphics are same ,  control and sound are carbon copy of original mgs num_extend
some more work should have been done to improve character models for gc and xbox . 
i applied this product to all the wood surfaces of the chair as directed on the package . 
was hoping this product would do the job but it didn t . 
amazon told them that i wanted the unit replaced . 
once the seat completely detached on one side ,  you couldn t sit on it anymore . 
currently it is in a corner in the play room with the wheels locked . 
i should have done my homework instead of trusting the false product description here . 
$ for one bottle is robbery and i will be sending it back for a refund !  !  !  !  . 
please note that in some cases you may need to resynchronize the gamepad and receiver after this procedure . 
the  sweet tea  flavor is just sweet ,  no tea . 
not sure it he had a reaction to something else or what . 
can t believe this rated so high and so many reviews boasted its functionality and high quality . 
it s useless as the characters all look the same  very ugly  . 
i ve bought a number of dockers shoes in different styles over the past num_num years or so . 
i highly recommend leapfrog s dreamscape crib soother instead . 
there is some truly garish level designs here as well in the final episode num_num in san francisco . 
for a medium roast i expected at least a coffee taste . 
i did love the print on it just wished it wasn t broken . 
this center is just about num_num miles from my house . 
and it s terrible . oh ,  the new weapons  flamethrower ,  fuel rod cannon  and vehicles  banshee ,  various warthogs  are neat . 
i popped open the top of the jarrow bottle . 
so to them even fresh litter was  used  and this led to an unexpected cat dump in the shower . 
however this product was not to my taste at all . 
the creamer is very good ,  but the packaging was horrible . 
and after you ve leveled up all of them as you go along in the game ,  well . 
i ve seen a lot of overrated games ,  but this one amazed even me . take max payne . 
in fact ,  i m not sure where anything is . 
i got the package and it was new condition . 
i am putting it in the attic because it never gets used . 
once you know it s not terrible but there are other problems . 
it thought the armband would be very handy even though it is not very attractive . 
then ,  i see that other reviewers point out that the fillers that supposedly  disperse  cultures are also laxative ingredients . 
this will be my num_extend and i ll sell this one and get another brand . pretty disappointed with palm . 
i fiddled around with it and tested various levels of sking dampness under the chest strap . 
my suggestion is always buy cologne only after sampling it in person from any store since preferences vary widely . 
the plus is that they are wood ,  and its so hard to find wood blocks in the stores . 
well lucky me ,  the manual makes no mention of a reset option . 
i gave it num_num stars due to the allergic reaction that i experienced . 
the leaves have been eaten by something ,  in a  lacy  pattern . 
i don t fancy stuff made in china and will instead purchase a romertopf made in germany . 
too bad because it is very well made and a nice looking bad . 
apparently i m supposed to add new attractant every week ,  and after rain . 
all of my three girls hate this game . 
got more power but difficult to set up as got a num_num hz hum which i can not remove . 
it just stayed gummy and gluey and then it peeled my polish off when i hit something hours later . 
i think it s fun ,  but i m not a cat . 
this was advertised as num_num but had only num_num pins . 
the pockets are so small ,  my cell phone doesn t even fit in there . 
the yogurt coating has kind of an artificial sweetener taste to it . 
the norpro is poorly constructed ,  and won t last long . 
i get better results from generic gel insoles from the department store . 
i received this item and could not wait to use it . 
i didn t realize when i ordered some dr . 
i threw it away in just a few hours . 
yeah ,  i took it as prescribed ,  there was no change . 
if your dog likes poop ,  then your dog likes poop . 
and even so .  .  . i ended up with some streaks . 
i would not buy these for any dogs . 
still a second battery is a must if this tool is going to be the primary blower . 
i m not sure what kind of glue they re using on these nowadays ,  but it s worthless . 
spend num_num or num_num dollars more and get a good radio . 
i m just going to trash the remaining five cans and write them off . 
i would not recommend these cheaply made gloves . 
i decided to try it again ,  but had the same results . 
the socks that i got were way too big . 
the description says it is non stick ,  i shouldn t have to put cooking oil . 
this case should be priced at $ for those that was a piece of crap for cheap . 
i am suspicious of the  currently  other review giving num_num stars . 
all seemed well when plugging into the phone . 
your reception will be based on the location of your router and receivers . 
there is a break in one of the wires right near the plug . 
the only way this didn t mess up my stomach was if i was completely full . 
another bug is the fact that shooting at someone is completely random . 
the omaha level is a nice try  for the millionth time  ,  but still no cigar . 
we buy them all the time ,  but surely they re not worth such a large markup . 
i m sure this cable is very high quality ,  but c mon design guys ,  get a brain . 
the formula is the same ,  but the game is horribly imbalanced . 
i am a huge fan of izze sparkling juice and figured this would be similar to that . 
marcus then makes a new lead in life by becoming a cop with the help of his father s friend . 
the hat did not look good on either as it was too big and bulky . 
this is sad because the screen size is what i wanted and the price was right . 
it lighter than i expected but the heat is very good . 
i had to replace my wired mouse and went to staples . 
the media is cool to look at ,  but it simply does not work using the built in drive superdrive . 
this natures glow that they call their self tanner smells bad like all the rest after applying . 
i hate through money away on junk like this no matter how little it was . 
all of them are mature cats ,  though ,  so maybe a younger cat would like it . 
this bag could be perfect if it had longer straps . 
this may work better where the animals are not in such desperate conditions . 
packet loss ,  random reboot loop ,  you name it ,  it does . 
i ,  nor my other creations ,  were ever asked a question by a wwf superstar . 
the magnetic on these tins is pretty weak and the lids aren t the best . 
hair milk really does make my hair curl beautifully . 
but the main ingredients are date and cashew powder . here s the kicker . 
i am a huge rpg fan and there aren t many games that i haven t played . 
i called belkin ,  they said don t use the cd ,  download the new version from their website . 
it has no optical zoom ,  no video recording ,  etc . 
i have to take the otter box off for the phone to sit and charge in the station . 
even more difficult ! i should have figured by the price it was too good to be true . 
my pups love these but they are made in china . 
the problem with small radios is their size restrictions . 
i m willing to pay a small premium over regular milk for the lack of cholesterol ,  etc . 
because the oil has been removed it sticks to the pan really really really bad ,  a big nasty mess . 
i am not fat ,  but i am busty .  .  .  . this is not meant for me . 
blinx himself is often sluggish to respond ,  especially when implementing his time controls . 
as another reviewer pointed out ,  the rolling ball is a little disgusting as well . 
num_extend cost me $ total and also has num_extend
there s no other way to say this :  this product smells bad . fortunately ,  it tastes better than it smells . 
i can not see any difference in the size of my pores or the oiliness of my skin . 
the container is very misleading as it makes it look larger than its true shape . 
instead i went with raw african organic shea butter . 
broke in a month ,  not sure what happened ,  but the light would automatically turn off . 
i think the power supply was the weak link . 
my youngest son ,  however ,  does like the berry pomegranate flavor . 
i bought the num_extend as an upgrade to my num_extend which ran like a champ . 
first ,  i was put off by the very long cord and the large audio processing unit on it . 
but this game ran on it s easiest level is next to impossible . 
tried that one as soon as i got it with the same result . 
this selection just does not do it for me . 
i put up several targets and was testing num_num different types of pellets . 
first of all ,  this doesn t even come with num_num person to play with in it . 
the watch was nice but the band was a strange color and design . 
i am very disappointed so far with what sony ,  sega ,  and other software firms have offered for num_extend
i incorrectly assumed alba products would be more along those lines . 
naturtint ,  you are not anything near natural ,  you suck . 
i wanted to love this eye repair creme ,  but couldn t ,  because i m allergic to it . 
but even then she couldn t stand to play with it for more than num_num minutes tops . 
i needed to get a refund for the purchase . 
terra gold needs to revamp their recipe !  just sayin . 
my wife quickly gave up on it and pulled her cable out . 
i might consider buying one again ,  but not from high n low trading . 
i could barely even get into playing it . 
i also like that you can purchase new moves and techniques with  z coins   found throughout levels +the destroyable environment . 
regardless; chlorophyll has no effect on my body odor however helps with ibs .  . keeping things  moving  . 
beware if you re interested in buying this item ,  the description of the product is false . 
i ended up throwing it out ,  a waste of money for me . 
of course i could barely taste anything so i added more . 
i would not even use it on a dromedary water bag . 
it is not  a snap  to add pages and alphabetize your collection . 
i found them cheaper other places ,  but ordered from amazon because of their return policy . 
now don t get me wrong ,  when this came out i played the heck out of it and enjoyed it . 
but the game drags on and on forever ,  with a lot of level grinding . 
i like blackberry pouches because they stay open and don t collapse . 
it had two male usb ports of one end and a one female port on the other . 
i threw it in the trash where it belongs . 
limit caffeine products to avoid nervousness ,  sleeplessness ,  and occasional rapid heartbeat . 
it might or might not be tested on animals  i don t know  ,  but it is definitely made of animals . 
it was not fun chasing the balls everywhere . 
i don t know if it s the mixture of product ingredients ,  or what ,  but it looks better ,  and dries quick . 
first time i wore these they were slipping down into my shoes . 
the image might even be characterized as a misrepresentation . 
rr v came with my num_extend bundle so i can t say i wasted money on it . 
it seems weird to me that you d make a puppy pad that leaks on purpose . 
besides dirtying my pillowcases ,  my other concern is for my hair . 
all the little darts do is sink to the bottom . 
i feel ,  though ,  that it overemphasizes large scale dynamics ,  as though there is unwarranted shouting even with smaller passages . 
i will continue to use this for grinding spices ,  but if it breaks ,  i will not buy another one . 
i on the other hand love the flavor of black or green teas . 
this is a flavored syrup not a raspberry syrup . 
 i easily got through the whole game using minor heal and num_extend
however ,  they are also very frustrated by the fact that things keep falling off the rocket . 
i was raging mad !  but the quiet kind of mad that leaves one feeling homicidal . 
if something works okay that is good enough . 
i returned as soon as i opened box . 
this doesn t seem to fit the descriptions of the last reviews list . 
if you push in with your finger ,  it gives in . 
reading all the other reviews ,  i assumed these chips were going to taste like potato chips . 
it made my ends look browner than my normal hair color . 
i am charging num_num devices concurrently as i type ,  and have all ports loaded . 
i can t believe companies are willing to put out such an inconsistent and cheap product . 
don t reward morons with your business .  shame ,  too ,  because the rings are great !   . 
radio should be an easy and cheap integration ,  at least on the corded num_extend
i did not like the cone look !  i felt i looked ridiculous . 
the item appeared to be filled with air and no longer secure . 
at first i did not feel too special but after a few minutes . 
i love floral and woody tones ,  but this just smells like dirt . 
it is also too small to find quickly with your eye when you need it . 
i think it s a cute bear ,  but not worth num_num dollars . 
you can cut them down based on your test results using heavier points . 
however ,  it was the least expensive and i was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked . 
this is the second type of fish food from this manufacturer that i have tried for my oscar . 
i never had this problem before ,  with any covers i ve ever owned . 
now i ve got a hard on . i wouldn t suggest this game for anyone short of being a hardcore marvel fanboy . 
i finally got or to stay on by shutting down all background sync . 
the function keys don t work the way they should . 
its taste is bitter ,  and its texture is grainy . 
the graphics are below par for a playstation num_num game . 
although you keep it in the freezer it never feels cold . 
the screen isnt bad at displaying colors ,  in fact ,  it has very good color definition . 
i mean ,  i wouldn t recommend these to my worse foe . 
 try disabling any pop up or antivirus software before applying changes ,  try from another computer . 
ability ,  as well as slowly introduce a better arsenal of weapons used solely for the enemy . 
i manually configured that through its web interface and then its wireless and ethernet connections start working . good so far . 
parr vaguely attributed his crimes to prodding by the legendary elly kedward  aka  the blair witch   . 
i did follow the instructions ,  it s not something you will enjoy eating specially if you like eating beans . 
too bad they can t recover all the hours of lost gameplay . i m sticking with sony cards from now on . 
just leave the brush along and stop trying to change it . 
so far ,  i highly recommened it over this product ,  even though you gotta pay more . 
quite honestly ,  playing on my commodore num_num was more fun . 
i am lucky i didnt have an accident . 
well ,  at least netgear employs people in num_extend world toilets so they won t have to starve . 
zojurishi service is truley pathetic !  if you get a good one ,  lucky you . 
but lately ,  it s been causing my num_num to act like it s possessed . 
i hadn t  upgraded  madden since the num_num version . 
i stopped using it and even a month later my nails are still cracking and splitting . 
they did like the box it came in ,  naturally . 
nobody can hear me forreal but i can hear them . 
like another reviewer s ,  my experience has been mixed . 
this cable is ultra thin and must not be shielded well . 
the cut is not what it used to be . 
i seriously and in all honesty cannot comprehend why there is such a huge fanbase for this game . 
not sure if it is genuine or not ,  but this cable does not work properly . 
also ,  this is just like all the other final fantasys . 
same thing ,  came home and found the power had gone out . 
i know ,  some might think it s my voice ,  or the way i speak . 
you can get an ac adapter that will accept the usb connection . 
on the positive side doom num_num reminds me of the pc game aliens vs . 
inside the house ,  it would not lock on at all . 
fortunatley ,  no one got hurt ,  but i wouldn t risk using them again . 
good amount for price ,  but certainly not the greatest aroma i ve ever smelt and doesn t seem to last long . 
i did not get the rolls of dead skin i so desperately hoped for . 
from  :   .  .  fda issues health warning to veterinarians ,  pet owners about chicken jerky products from chinanov num_extend num_extend newsmagazinerockville ,  md . 
the skin on my nose felt softer ,  but my pores were still clogged . 
pretty simple . for the price this game isn t too bad . 
but not long after using the product ,  it decompresses into a hard slab of cushion . 
there was almost immediate relief and the stinging dissipated . 
selling at a garage sale due to shipping costs being greater than price . 
hey if you don t have xbox live don t bother getting this game . 
what i usually buy is an avenir groove dual saddle . 
one battery was dead ,  num_num had a low charge ,  and one had a moderately high charge . 
i have loved this sandal in the past so i re ordered . 
like most games now ,  the graphics are very nice and the music is cheesy . 
all the puzzle pieces are the same ,  the only difference being the color . 
cost more to ship it back than it cost so i the it away . 
to have a razor you use weekly sitting on its side is ridiculous . 
far from creating tension ,  this results in boredom ,  as you skulk around looking for somebody to frag . 
trying to get motorola to fix it ,  but no help so far . audio books may have issues . 
i am looking to buy the first one as i did not keep mine . 
however ,  i have not seen a notable difference in the flea population on the two dogs . 
i used to eat these a long time ago . 
i googled it ,  and found ,  of course ,  some pithy critiques . 
i even used olive oil instead of vegetable like other people here said to do . 
and i cannot find any extra large in this pattern anywhere !  . 
will either go back to botox or some other filler . 
like the other cutouts on the phone this one was done inaccurately and was not aligned correctly . 
that should make the game accessible for % of human beings and some animals like the parrot . 
i wouldn t trust giving it to my dog . 
french roast coffee is naturally lower acid as a function of the roasting process . 
made from plants !  free of formaldehyde ,  chlorine ,  gmo s ,  petrochemicals ,  ammonia and so much more . 
further ,  they simply do not show up in bad lighting conditions much better than the standard black sights . 
i the bought and changed out the oil filter housing ,  thinking it went bad ,  and installed a third one . 
if you want to try some soldering ,  and buy some new caps . 
two different customer service reps were very rude as we were trying to diagnose the fault . 
after using them for a few months ,  i noticed that they would not hold a vaccuum . 
you can wave ,  stand ,  move in front of it all you want and it won t go off . 
if you do get a bit of mold ,  bleach will kill it quickly . 
it s the stupidest thing i ve seen yet as far as ordering methods . 
at first i was really happy with these . 
do yourself a favor :  eat an orange and drink a glass of cold filtered water . 
i ll start with the hardware itself :  it doesn t work . 
the back cover popped off second day !  not impressed with quality of this item . 
second ,  many of the themes are a bit scary . 
at the time these devices were all we were using to hold our wheels . 
the fragrance is described as musky ,  but i can t smell a bit of musk . 
i like the roleplaying games ,  and thought that this would be fun ,  i was wrong . 
there are num_num calories per bar of which num_num are from fat . 
but forcing me to play it like this .  .  . sorry ,  not gonna waste my time . 
we could do this many time before the thing would shut down completely and fail to turn back on . 
if you have an unshrouded front sight post and loose sights ,  this may be for you . 
the installation went pretty smooth until then end when i was clicking the screen back onto the phone . 
this was bigger than expected  my bad ,  the size is listed  so it was too big for my dogs . 
until then i will have an extra monitor on my desktop and two keyboards and two mice . 
no way these pants are either of these dimensions . 
the volume is alright ,  sounds very hollow ,  though . 
if it didn t irritate my skin ,  this would have been a holy grail product . 
pros : initially makes hardwood floors look great . cons : wears off over time just as any other finish will . 
it kept catching my hair on the sides of the plates . 
there is not much to do except memorize the combo moves for each player and then the fatality move . 
these are not at all what i expected . 
i picked up this item ,  hoping it would alleviate the problem . 
i ve read just about every review ,  on every website that i can find . 
returning this item so i can get something decent . 
the problem is that it stopped working after a couple of weeks . 
i often fall of the cliff since i can t tell where my feet are . 
seems like a waste of money to me . 
i wasn t noticing a change so i left it in for an hour . 
however ,  it is advertised as a health food and this is where i run into issues . 
then it diminishes very quickly but there is a great afterbite or aftertaste . 
the majority were bad out of the package . 
i would definitely not recommend this no chip polish . 
over the years i have tasted dozens of balsamic vinagars . 
you have to do it at least num_num minutes before or after a meal . 
this is an overall good game ,  but it suffers from horrid online lag . 
num_extend you can only play up to num_num players . 
i am still waiting to use this pizza cutter . 
well ,  it sure was a big ole plastic orange ball . 
as a teaching tool to accurately teach a kid how to track the money he is saving ,  it stinks . 
my brother got up to the halfway point of the game in like num_num and a half hour . 
when i had to use it ,  i did and it was okay . 
i got it and played it once and had to take it out . 
the box was so light i thought it surely must be empty . 
i knew it would be hit or miss .  .  . definitely a miss . 
it was determined that it indeed arrived doa . 
their quality level seems to be decreasing lately . 
where i live it can get up to num_num degrees in the summertime . 
i ordered these a bit big for what i knew would be laundry shrinkage . 
the plastic clips don t hold my hair very well and are too bulky to pack in a suitcase . 
although the ai is smart ,  bad guys spawned behind me after i secured a room . 
i returned one ,  still have the other one . i m onto a new brand . 
my stuffy nose got worst and i had to breath via my mouth . 
it is hard to handle the phone with cover coming off . 
you play as a covenant and can wield the cool sword . 
tony hawk s pro skater num_num is my target now . 
i stress  meal replacement  because at num_num calories it is more than a snack . 
wouldn t you like to know before you order what country these things are made in ?  . 
after that ,  everyone i know lost interest very quickly . 
i went through the whole game again trying to find the package he was refering to . 
i can t get the my sight zeroed in with these pellets . 
however ,  it only has about four hours of use before you need to recharge . 
i have had a few home gyms including num_num total gyms and num_num bowflex . 
i don t understand what type of skin the glowing reviewersa have but mine certainly isn t compatible with this . 
it is fun ,  when it works ,  to see the butter ,  jelly and other sauces ,  etc . 
the look like ligature marks ,  as if someone tried to strangle me with nylon rope . it s bad . 
the main character isn t someone i particularly have any interest in ,  the other characters are okay ,  but nothing special . 
to bake a regular sized box of brownies takes over an hour !  . 
hope you understand !  too much !  do not order from them . 
it was the most horrid smell and permeated our entire house . 
a bunch of nobodies rapping about how they gonna be the streets and earn money in the nba someday . 
normally i send all my pix to friends after we re out . 
my commercial scraper has rounded corners and was $
let me start of by saying i have had this keyboard for num_num years . 
it was from l oreal ,  a trusted producer so i had quite an expectation . 
kerasal still does a better job but much more costly for exfoliation . 
neither of his cats would touch these treats . i can t attest to the effectiveness of these treats . 
i may just change the strings completely again to see if i just have some dead strings . 
wish i hadn t spend good money on it . 
i think i can fix this by drilling some holes in it but i may get too much noise . 
the color is not white but a dirty silver or gray color . 
since the outside of the cap is true satin ,  it doesn t snag my hair at all . 
so i ve done my research on de ,  and the different types . 
the price for it was not high for it did . 
i might recommend you try their main two flavors instead . 
you really have to push them inside your ear and the comfort is unbearable . 
they definitely prefer this to regular paint ! my kids would give this product num_num stars . 
that would mean i could mix four loaves of sandwich bread at a time . 
i cannot believe that this this is $
if i removed the screen ,  bugs would swarm in through the fan grates . 
i really really really would not recommend this to anyone . 
i m afraid that they also have no control what comes from china . 
i ve only owned them for a month or so qualifying these as a failure in my book . 
as the first game on my new num_extend system ,  i prepared myself to be wowed by num_extend
it was immediately evident that levi s rigorous quality standards had been dropped . 
i bought a similar hat from kohls num_num years ago . 
familiar enough the time num_extend came out so did  too fast too furious !   wow . 
the num_extend will work if you buy the num_extend version num_extend
i also had problems with weevils  a weevil is a beetle . 
the story line is your rocket gets hit by an asteroid and you land on a weird planet . 
the pitcher can set up the batter like in a real baseball game . 
i truly don t understand the reviews ?  ?  this stuff is terrible !  !  also ,  it smells gross . 
if you value your health you will not purchase this product !  !  . 
i wear a size num_extend shoe ,  ordered a size num_num after reading prior reviews . 
the num_extend used to have num_extend drivers ,  but the num_extend have num_extend drivers . 
i ended up buying the rs num_num off amazon and am very happy with the around ear design . 
i called and their human resources told me my order would be canceled not to worry about it . 
i am talking time being cut in half ,  literally . 
went back to the muffs ,  but the damage was done . 
it is a pain to set up and use ,  it is not even worth it . 
i can t bring myself to give it two stars . 
now ,  not even num_num hours later ,  they re num_extend
i have a powershot num_extend that stopped working within a year because of the num_extend error . 
dont waste your money and the shipping cost . karlac . 
then i found out that yuban somehow changed their secret formula and the results was highly disappointing . 
unless you are looking for very ,  very short range communication . 
i am pretty tired of toys that look cute but don t teach much . 
so frustrating that the quality has decreased since last i bought this product . 
i put both rings on the front section of tube . 
and most importantly the game is full of bugs and glitches that make this game almost unplayable . 
there was no way to turn it back on ,  other than powering num_extend
i will wait and see if it comes before june is gone . 
i think illy s canned cappuccino drink tastes much better . 
maybe i have abnormal ears ,  but i don t think so . 
it seems to work better all around from the very beginning . 
it is open at the top and kind of goofy looking . 
perhaps it works better on other materials than synthetic ones . 
okay ,  despite the bad reviews mixed in ,  i wanted to give this stuff a shot . 
medora snacks popcorners popped corn chips ,  butter ,  num_extend bagsway to much salt ruined the flavor . 
you also have to take num_num a day and they are huge pill and smell like tea tree oil . 
no case only a thin cover that snaps on . 
at first she got a puzzled look on her face and walked away . 
the point of video games is to have fun ,  not to stress you out . 
so it won t kill to buy it and try it but i won t recommend it . 
it under cooks and you need to learn how to use it . 
many people develop dermatitis from prolonged exposure to it . 
i just want one napkin to come out ,  every single time . 
i wouldn t even use it as air freshened . 
second issue ,  the tab broke off of the guard . 
then i shortened the track  and tried different designs  until it started collecting dust and cat hair . 
i thought it was a bad piece ,  and returned it to the store ,  and got a replacement . 
i just used it until i got another one . 
when i tried closing the lid ,  the top would not close . 
i ve managed to somewhat hide the cables from immediate sight . 
i applied it to my face ,  shoulders ,  arms ,  neck ,  ears and legs . 
i bought one from my local game store and now my nes works . 
in fact ,  i advise that people stay away from this product ,  or take extreme precautions . 
when we plugged in the unit ,  it emitted a foul odor that caused a pretty severe allergic reaction . 
so much gunk gets stuck down in the blades and it s really hard to get off . 
i was upset but then i guess for the price it is to be expected . 
yes ,  it smells nice ,  but like another reviewer mentioned ,  i prefer a product that does what it says . 
game developers ,  presumably tortured into submission by their publishers ,  have been releasing outlandishly buggy games . 
its really for the rainy states ,  not northern california ,  in sonoma county , ect , ect , will use it if it ever rains here . 
these are a good natural alternative to sleeping pills . 
this is not a cordless mouse you pack with you . 
i ordered online and it is not comfortable . 
i rated this a num_num stars because ms . 
there was also an anything but smooth ,  waxy feel to my arms and hands as well . 
it s odd how they didn t include either of the two big guys on the super nes . 
may try it mixed with another tea to see if it will work that way . 
the entire mechanism is held on by cloth ,  so i cut through the cloth and discovered tons of wires . 
my dog loves these ,  and i purchased them for years . 
seriously ?  and we re supposed to pay monthly for that ?  . 
the phone has a lot of features ,  but they are all pretty much junk . 
they are ten months old ,  and they love to bat their toys around and chase them . 
good idea ,  but the air keeps leaking out after a day or two . 
the form factor is great for my pocket ,  which is great . i received my unit yesterday ,  and it is defective . 
the num_num youngest giggled a bit at first but then tired of it quickly . 
the sound quality is great ,  specially for being a bluetooth . 
we purchased this thing thinking it would be great for light cleaning . 
it doesn t transfer easily and is much ,  much easier to apply  evenly  . 
sun has big and small nodes and shop and nodes are equal to terminals . 
the bottons are not the easiest for a younger infant to press either . 
i had high hopes for this product due to very good reviews and all the supposedly beneficial ingredients . 
i took several sips to be sure i hated it . 
the pen i got is wonderful though and i purchased it at petsmart . 
also as a female bike rider ,  i found this helmet extremely unattractive . 
today i noticed the paint is already wearing off . 
up front :  i do not own this product . 
i ve owned this kettle for years and love it . 
days of game time pass . finally ,  i found the game to be ,  visually ,  very poorly presented . 
this doesn t seem particularly more rugged than any current point and shoot . 
i am still on the fence on this one . 
i bought this watch because of the style . 
also ,  i received a maroon colored top rather than the cute yellow one they advertise . 
it plays at a preprogrammed song speed no matter how quickly or slowly you are actually playing the instrument . 
i wanted to find a case that provided protection ,  but didn t hide the beauty of my new iphone num_extend
just hated it not anything more to say about then that . 
i m a bit surprised how foul this soup smells and tastes . 
but this conditioner actually made my hair more frizzy . 
i thought formula might be handy on the go ,  but the baby hates this stuff . 
it slips on the lids and only opens jars that i could easily open by hand . 
i love the foodsaver and really wanted to utilize the canisters . 
the flex case didn t fit the evo i own and it appears to be missing something . 
sure enough ,  the glass shattered when it hit the floor . 
so the remaining patches are useless unless i get more glue . 
the peridots ,  my birthstone ,  are a disappointment in that they are a pale lime green . 
had to have eye rinsed out with saline solution for num_num minutes . 
he rarely uses it as a walker though . 
i thought this product might be a good addition to my diet . 
still ,  see the movie before you play this  game  so you ll get some thrill out of it . 
i estimate that this took up to num_num seconds ,  an eternity while waiting to take another picture . 
i ordered this for my num_num little dogs thinking i was doing a good thing . 
the buzz seems well constructed but i can t get by the sound buttons . 
if both of those things weren t enough ,  the machine clogs and doesn t really move through the grinder at all . 
i have several mice and trackballs from logitech and all function perfectly with the same setpoint software . 
do not play this game ,  play something else . 
first the ratchet mechanism died after a few weeks . 
worked fine for a few months ,  then it got stuck on celsius and can t be set back to farenheit . 
i get this is real ,  and primal and so decided this wasn t the right fit . 
i paid $ for the le vs $ for this one . 
i m sure others probably love it but i won t be buying it again . 
i had to take a sponge to spread it evenly on the tires . 
you touch or swipe the screen ,  and nothing happens . 
i use the cheapest oral b electric brush  non pulsating  in the morning and before bed with colgate total . 
i own many palettes and singles ,  from high end to low end . 
they were so cheap that if they had lasted a month or two they would have been worth it . 
the concept of this product is great ,  but ,  the performance isn t . 
the tracks don t hold in place like they should . 
the tube seems to deteriorate especially at the seams . 
they increase the leg size ,  but not the waist . 
if i had to get it out of this holster to defend myself i would be killed . 
after i saw the long list of glowing reviews i decided to try a box of these . 
wish i could find one with a different clipping mechanism on amazon . 
my guild had over num_num players ,  most of which have dropped ddo . the reason ?  content  or lack thereof  . 
it does relax a bit but does not keep you asleep throughout the night . 
it s probably a fine card but it just physically won t fit my system . 
there are cracks on the top of both shoes after barely a month of use . 
however ,  soft stools were the results with my two little dogs . 
it had never gotten into my eyes ,  that i m very careful about . 
it then started giving me problem after problem . 
i was so excited bec of the kickstand but the case will not fit an extended battery . 
always had to force iphone and ends up giving this up due to this problem . 
it is very pleasant in texture and odor free . 
out of the box the oven thermometer did not work . 
all other dove deodorants have strong scents to them except for the cucumber and green tea one . 
just seems like a waste of metal to have to replace these nonstick pans every two years . 
we tried adjusting the ropes behind the seat like the directions said ,  and they never budged . 
there was no aluminum anywhere on the planet . 
prior to recieving this chair we were using a fisher price chair that was not nearly as attractive . 
the lining ?  rounded off and more or less floating in the bag . 
big beltbuckles can be comfortable ,  even when in crunched positions ,  if they are rounded . 
the mechanic is drastically changed from the previous gta s . 
i bought two of these several months ago . 
the fact they write tecmo bowl on the cover should be grounds for a law suit . 
just received this item and i am super disappointed with the size . 
i ll say right off the bat that i ve been a  jif  mom forever . 
after less than num_num months ,  the coating is coming off . 
later on i used a diaper cream that had zinc in it . 
it s poorly constructed ,  the grinding pads slip and it has no power . 
wow !  i will keep this thing ,  but only to play a horribly funny joke of someone . 
it s a bad movie where you press the  x  button over and over again during battle scenes . 
i ve purchased several dog toys on amazon and never had a problem . 
after using it the third days ,  i got hives all over my body . 
on the surface it looks and feels like the perfect companion to play your ipod s music on any radio . 
neither the distance nor the quality is any better than my old ,  cheap panasonic ones . 
she has another `bike  she received as a gift and pushes it around every day and plays with it . 
i had to push very very hard multiple times just to get a little bit of color . 
the polish has a slight pink hue in the bottle only . 
and the powder just didn t seem to blend as well as i d like either . 
i have to warn small dog owners about using this product without researching the ingredients . 
it s a shame sega fans will never stop defending the saturn with the same old argument . 
this was a decent unit when it was new . 
the cut scenes were amazing ,  and the character leveling it very interesting ,  but that is all . 
otherwise ,  i have to bring it to someone who has the right tools . 
they killed the poor little squirrels in a day or two . 
i reminds me more of robitussin cough medicine . 
the first time i tried this ,  i put opi  you don t know jaques  over it . 
but $ is a big investment and this cage isn t worth it . 
i simply could not get the second one to line up . 
please do not waste money on that pos . 
the batteries pretty much spend their life in the floating charge mode . 
the original everlast mats weren t made of sponge . 
in fact ,  i ve read enough reviews over the years to become suspicious of the validity of some if warranted . 
very thin and flimsy ,  went in the garbage before i could pay for it . 
plug computer in ,  can i access the dsl modem ?  currently ,  no . 
i bought this for my son since he isn t quite ready for a huge twin bed yet . 
you d be better off wrapping your rounds in razor blades and trying to shove them into the gun . 
the story line is inconsistent where one level you are american ,  next polish ,  next french reisistance . 
if these issue both you as well ,  please learn from my mistakes . 
independent research shows that soy isn t good for cats and dogs . 
i tried using it many times ,  hoping i would acquire the taste ,  but it just didn t come at all . 
i could not get this set up with a secure network . 
just not the quality i have come to expect . 
it is very affordable ,  but the hairs keep falling out while shaving . 
the grill itself is hard to clean after cooking meat on it .  .  . super easy cleanup when making sandwiches . 
i purchased this sizing ring guard to replace one that was becoming worn out on my ring . 
i ordered this with amazon prime ,  and it arrived right on time . 
this will make you look like bozo the clown . 
did not do well with my older skin . 
it works fine with a stereo and possibly with other tv s ,  but not a plasma . 
i wanted a num_num layer sak with magnifying glass and in line phillips screwdriver . 
i am not holding my breath ,  as i expect it to be longer . 
another negative reviewer rated them as a pos and believe he has that right . 
i bought a set of baby s first blocks from haba which are perfect for him right now . 
this just takes up a lot of space for something you can get in better forms . 
i wouldn t even give this polish one star but no choice . 
french press users don t waste your money on this grinder . 
ended up going with a furminator which saved a lot of time during shedding season . 
it just doesn t work . i also looked up consumer reports num_num on protein powders . 
internet explorer ,  firefox apparently is too much on the router and it drops several times per hour . 
my knives love me !  !  sincerely ,  chef douglas james . 
this steamer works ok ,  but it broke in less than num_num months . 
this bag though has a fault of the long strap that goes back under the bag to snap . 
if you want my advice ,  look for something else . 
i even grated some ginger to add to it and it didnt help the flavor . 
it didn t make much of a difference on the dirt ,  even with scrubbing . 
it s not an expensive item ,  but i don t plan on buying this again . 
not only that ,  the top unit stopped working completely so all we can do is bake . 
all these high priced hair treatments including the high priced moroccan oil are nothing but cheap silicone filled garbage . 
and ,  all the plastic decorative icicles come off and have to be resecured . 
my dad was strapping this canteen to his pack and it dropped . 
the camera is blurry and doesn t reproduce colors well . 
so i ll admit ,  i m not a tea person . 
bought num_num unit for me and my gf . 
i wear a num_extend minimizer in wacaol brand bras . 
better off to wait for doom num_extend or area num_extend
i don t feel i can afford to maintain this collar . 
now if it was ninja gaiden ,  it would be worth looking up . 
i used these to steam my sticky rice . 
as for everyone else ,  you might want to play a game that doesn t suck so much . 
so i end up with messy globs stuck to my scoop and clumps falling apart . 
either it gives you a good shave ,  or it doesn t . 
its a discrace to xbox and the unreal series . 
i used this a few times a month . 
spend a little more money for a bed with better material . 
in the end ,  i regretted paying   .  .  .   for a game that i won t touch again . 
i ordered num_num sets of these for my daughter s dinosaur themed birthday party . 
i ll bet it works the same . shame on you ,  oribe . 
considering it has gold connectors ,  i ve no idea why it just so awful . 
once removed from laptop ,  the lock somehow reset in the locked position and my code would no longer work . 
the first time ,  it  dried out  and started working again . 
just leaves a slightly sticky feel and a horrid smell behind . 
cheap price $ but muzzle is very stiff  backpack type material with somewhat rough seems . 
it is made of very wide metal ,  with a vinyl padded cover . 
mario doesn t count as it was released num_num years ago . 
missle launchers aren t just limited to six missles fired one at a time anymore . 
i don t think a different size would have helped . 
even then it did not interest our cats in the least . 
so unless you actually think overpriced games are great ,  you shouldn t be voting me down . 
but i think they know the problem is out there and they don t want to address the problem . 
went camping with my son in backyard .  .  .  .  . this tent is good for kids only . 
it looks good and has a lot of power ,  too . then i put on the comb and conditioner attachment . 
it is hard to rate a product very high when it is broken in num_num months . 
i hate to say this but my cats can t stand it . 
these fit my earrins  small studs  ,  but they are awful . 
i wish i had bought harvest moon :  back to nature for ps back in the day . 
i got num_num of these for my num_num yr old twins  bdays . 
lastly ,  they are slippery as snot on wet concrete . 
the came is very mediocre ,  and is boring as all hell . 
then this morning ,  the plastic around the hinge broke off and it is no longer usable . 
not worth the quality and hassle for the price . 
there s just a lot of little things that add up to me having a big problem with it . 
dalton the guy you play as  says the most stupidest things i ever heard . 
the campaign is a blast whether you are evil or good . 
i cannot even comprehend in the slightest how a game like this got any popularity . 
my charli had a hard time eating i had to break it up before i gave it to her . 
like putting a cheap amp with high quality speakers in your car . 
the cable seemed well constructed but apparently not so well . 
we tried it out this week while we were experiencing unseasonably cold rains . 
next i tried it dry ,  just sprinkled on top . 
i just threw mine away instead of returning . 
it was a cheap buy ,  but still not worth a penny . 
while this maybe more versatile it is definitely not cheaper than buying boxed mac and cheese . 
maybe if you have a cat this would work well but defiantly not for dogs . 
well ,  i got what i paid for ! not a lot . 
i guess if you have nothing better to do ,  this would be a great little project for a hobbyist . 
street fighter ,  trust me you wont be disappointed . 
on a positive note ,  they have a lot of other products that are awesome . 
this form is a simple wing shift that looks ok at best . 
i was really looking forward to this game . 
not much to do about this one . third ,  the weight of these things is atrocious . 
i now have had an apple airport extreme and no more deaths . 
coupled with the $ delivery charge from amazon on this ,  $ is a bit of a joke . 
the bra fits fine ,  however ,  the shoulder straps are really stiff . 
i tried it on plant trimmings ,  no luck . 
it did not make my skin any softer or more moisturized than other products . 
i cannot comment upon its durability or time keeping because i returned it . 
the search for great hair products continues ,  but this is definitely not it . 
this root touch up by clairol did not have that and it was sorely missed . 
i have had lots of problems with this card ,  and i have still not gotten it to work . 
he was spinning the wheel really fast and i heard a bang and then he was screaming . 
the soles are hard ,  thin ,  and flat and feel very unnatural when you walk in them . 
this thing is just a pain in the ass !  !  !  i should have taken the reviews to heart . 
further ,  the num_extend fl oz drink is high in total carbs num_extend sugar num_extend and calories num_extend
i m now stuck with this thing and lost a great deal of money . 
the bowl in the num_num rocked around from the force . 
this is one of the worst dental products i have tried . 
no one in my family would eat them . 
these rollers are too hot and too hard . 
can listen but they are old school and not my wife s favorite at all . 
i have ruined the skin on my lower face for the rest of my life . 
almost everything you do in this game will be done with dice . 
they leak and they are thin with padding non existent in places . 
there is nothing about this product your children should eat . 
i think xyloburst is pretty close to being worth a try ,  just not there yet . 
i would not recommend this to anyone . a very unhappy customer . 
what a shame !  i had high hopes for pga num_extend
it is one of the most useless kitchen gadgets i own . 
you ll send more of you re time trekking through the various ruins that litter the landscape . 
i paid so little for it that it isn t a surprise . 
i can move and twist the bars around inside the sealed packing . 
not much new folks . elder scrolls :  oblivion is still the gold standard !  . 
this deodorant smells really good going on ,  and rolls on smoothly . 
i went to use this on my computer just to charge my phone and it want register it . 
for me ,  it s too waxy for the eyebrows . 
the second glass was already broken in num_num pieces ,  at the  weld   joint  between the upper bowl and stem . 
on our valves ,  they would not fit over the little nut on the inner most part of the valve . 
but when i wear them i am very uncomfortable ,  and have many contractions so i don t wear them . 
well ,  when i received them ,  i thought they were very cute and would work well for me . 
i m not on a low sodium diet ,  but learning to eat better so limiting my sodium intake . 
these medium stone washed have the weird color that is popular on jeans worn by num_num somethings . 
if i mount it on the passenger vents ,  it s too far away for me to see . 
to me  :  it was like drinking water . 
as long as a computer stays up and connected ,  everything seems ok . 
or ,  better yet he ll just stick with his all time favorite benebone !  !  !  . 
in addition to that disaster ,  the num_extend controller also suffers from  too many buttons  . 
there was almost immediate relief and the stinging dissipated . 
turns out there is no metal bar in it ,  but instead it was plastic or something similar . 
continue doing this until the credits roll . never before have i played a more disappointing game than final fantasy xiii . 
i put the batteries back in and the letters ll and hh appeared instead of the temperature . 
i am going to get my money back and buy from a reliable company . 
perhaps it works on other surfaces but skip it for wood floors !  . 
look for it in the bargain bin in a week or two before spending the full num_extend
i was very excited when i saw this in the store . 
since air hogs cut corners ,  the helicopter is now junk . 
it is only a temporary fix and it says so . 
the driver provided is not compatible with xp and caused system malfunctions . 
if not forget it .  . i tried it on at a dept . 
it is nothing but a syringe with a goofy tip on the end . 
it perfected the genre of survival horror and created a cult following immediately . 
i bought this because of all the rave reviews ,  but am sorely disappointed . 
i use a lot of almond flour ,  so i didn t hesitate to order five pounds of it . 
also my chinese crested didn t really get it . 
i bought this battery as a replacement less than a year ago . 
first problem was when i opened the package i immediately realized that i received a completely different product . 
run into a room ,  hold down  x  and you win . 
bam !  entertainment does make good games though ,  so get the other fps they made ,  ecks vs . 
both are very skinny children . anyway ,  the metal bent in the frame close to the the wheel when using it . 
orange seemed most appealing to me ,  but i do not like it . 
after about a months use they failed too . 
it was obvious the greenies was to blame ,  and i have heard of other dogs having similar problems . 
and certainly ,  this is not a bad product at all . 
this stuff stinks to the highest but my hair comes out pretty detangled . 
need to make clear what it is you are buying . 
their secret ,  proprietary mix  ,  but taurine is listed and the caffeine content is obvious . 
i rather stick to my wide tooth comb . 
this means that it can not auto connect to your bluetooth phone when your in the car . 
unless you eat hamburgers as your main meat entree ,  save your money . 
i wanted products for follow up teaching at home . 
after playing so long ,  you soon start to see the same models in the same armor every day . 
hopfully it did not damage the socket on the ipod . 
ended up using a manual can opener to finish . 
however ,  i ve enjoyed supplementing my meals with this nutritious energy boost for some time . 
zo is insoluble in water ,  used in many industries ,  in ointments ,  creams and lotions . 
essentially the headband makes contact only at the very center of the top of your head . 
this case didn t hold up well at all ,  broker within the first month . 
the victorio leaves no mess . my neighbor had one of these and finally gave it to her maid . 
i spend a fortune on them and have to start being more careful . 
yes ,  it looked damn cool in the trailers . 
i would probably use it as a base for a french manicure . 
so i turned over and slept on my side . 
wish i d have gotten something a little nicer though . 
i wore the liners and a heavy pair of knee high socks . 
the circle is the only one that says anything . 
i usually put a small amount of water in my mouth ,  and then added the tablet and swallow . 
therefore ,  i did not fall in love with them as i had hoped . 
but for all of its positive qualities ,  i could only eat one bite before throwing the rest away . 
the price wasn t bad but it doesn t do anything for my cat it could be my cats age . 
what a sorry excuse to use the goldeneye title to sell games . 
we took it out of the box and everybody got a kick out of it . 
this game did not engage me at all . 
it comes in a paste tube which cracks easy and allowed oil from the wax to leak out . 
i was disappointed that my kitten doesn t like this flavor . 
i was deceived by some of the positive reviews of this product . 
we don t even have a deep mattress but now the bare mattress shows on the sides . 
it still didn t break and i had to unbuckle it to get it off him . 
these two once again are on par with the rest of the series . 
sorry ,  but that s a deal breaker for me . 
sure ,  protect your display and you have to hammer the glass to get it to recognize your fingers . 
though the picture seems to depict the butterfly as being plastic ,  it s just cardboard . 
when i flipped the little speaker out it just snapped for no reason . 
edit :  it did not work for my dog . 
so ,  bad unit ,  plus bad info from their tech support . 
a few minutes after that ,  the batteries would stop completely . 
i figured the batteries might be getting low . 
i did get a refund but had to return the item on my own dime . 
secondly ,  they are very roughly stamped out parts and as such have very sharp edges from the stamping process . 
the only thing i had changed in my normal daily shaving was the brush . 
we are currently using the toy as a door stop . 
i am not sure how to describe it . 
and since sonicare replacement heads are so expensive ,  it s probably not worth the purchase . 
it was small enough for travel and camping and weighs small amounts very nicely . 
purchased this item to hook our wii up to our new hdtv  thank you amazon deal of the day !   . 
full opening doors ,  stronger bars ,  lots more room and more . 
shame on this company for finding the lowest cost producer to safe a few dimes . 
unreal is much ,  much better in my opinion . 
it is about the size of a small beret ,  with at most ,  num_num inch of overhang in back . 
he hasn t stopped chewing on it since i gave it to him . 
this is definitely a case in which newer wasn t better . 
at this point you take a deep breath and think  well at least that s over .  .  .   . 
the emeril s big easy bold has that great robust coffee taste without the bitterness . 
it left a streaky mess and nothing to be proud of . 
there s either no one else on line ,  or brats that think theyre playing halo num_extend
icaps are expensive ,  dishonest ,  a scam ,  and useless . 
i couldn t get over the bad taste that this gives the water . 
i am still completely baffled by why they would use this design . 
when you put the polish on you only get clear with maybe a few sparkles literally . 
the pouch is to insecure for them to feel safe . 
this did not allow me to access the built in memory ,  however ,  as you can with most devices . 
why ?  no explanation is given for what the houses represent . 
they are low in calories and low in taste . 
they do not look feminine and the fabric does not feel like a toe sack . 
i ll have to find another armband that has enough room to allow a phone with a case . 
that may be ,  but there are materials slicker and safer still ,  such as glass . 
nullifying the two primary reasons i have loved it all these years . 
however ,  if the dog was not kept soundly distracted he would return to fussing over the nose strap . 
after reading many positive reviews ,  i ordered two rubbermaid scrapers in different sizes . 
very disappointed !  i always buy large and these were big enough to fit num_num people in them . 
if you have one of those kids ,  i recommend the survivor case . 
the only way to make sure it s off is to unplug it . 
in the case of the galaxy num_extend the battery construction is an important part of the nfc function . 
no ,  i did not drop or abuse these headphones . 
very poorly thought out and constructed design .  .  . i ended spending more hard earned money on a gatco system ,  way better !  !  !  . 
the question was asked about raising butterflies from breeders  like this product  and releasing them . 
and the beatings can be separated into two categories . 
i bought this mirror based on all of the raves . first of all ,  the distortion is terrible . 
shocked that no one else wrote this in their review when i ordered it !  . 
i paid $ for it ,  thinking it was a good deal . 
i won t be caught dead walking around town with this little makeup bag on my shoulder . 
these are really cheaper ,  so obviously my expectations were pretty low . 
you can open or close the apex tray while the disc is still playing . 
it was alos difficult to get the right exposure settings . 
these are quite possibly the worst work shoes i have ever purchased . 
i charged it overnight for over num_extend hours and it did not show a charge for my phone . 
this battery is not new in any way . 
the apple taste was very light which i think didn t help the texture problem . 
environments are beautifully rendered ,  but ultimately all look similar in design and color . 
but if this were my only call i would have had no idea . 
when it gets wet ,  it smells terrible and it is like glue . 
phone book name displys only first half of first line ,  although it allows you to enter two num_extend
you can t even select what color the car changes to . 
well made and really does the job ,  but . 
it is the first vacuum that i bought for my small apt i used to live in . 
in the same way ,  let s say ,  you experience some camembert cheese by smelling it ,  without necessarily ingesting any . 
i would not buy them again and will probably never use them . 
but ,  after that .  .  .  .  . total frizz as if i never used it . 
i have wore a num_extend since i was num_num and have shopped online for years . 
stick your toes in a bucket of water and you ll get the same affect . 
go on youtube and watch videos on survival knives to know what to look for . 
the size of these boots are way off . 
i removed the pedals and threw them away . 
it s nothing but rolled up cardboard pieces on a wire . 
it lasted for about num_num min and then i had to throw it away . 
i had ordered this one in s and the cups fitted fine but the band was too loose . 
have returned it due to the lack of support . 
first of all ,  it misses a lot of tiny hairs . 
i wouldn t recommend spending your hard earned money on nyx doll eye mascara . 
well ,  you still get new pokemon from the wild as you did before ,  but it s slightly different . 
i totally forgot to send it back ,  carried it with me all these years ,  and finally thew it away . 
it has an easy adjustable spray tip that goes from an almost mist to stream . 
if you put in four aa cells ,  the charging time is doubled . 
i was so hoping to find a non wired bra that gave some support . 
i tried both dry and wet brushing my face with it . 
i m sure this stuff is fine for storage ,  but not for the microwave or oven . 
i like a mustard taste but the vinegar overpowers the mustard . 
other relatives are like ,  oh she already has a kitchen etc . 
i usually love stratagey games ,  but this game is an exception . 
i usually love suave products but this purchase was a let down . 
this kit was not at all what i was expecting . 
with tiny strands of a brown red never again !  if you want red hair get it done professionally . 
 note i was using xp num_num on both machines and ntsc file system .   . 
these weapons can be upgraded in statistics such as reload speed ,  power and clip size . 
received them and while they were well packaged i was thoroughly disappointed in what i saw in the view . 
we have most of them and most accessories but this is definetly top heavy . 
you must prop a hard object into the button while twisting the numbers ,  which are very hard to turn . 
it made my hair very stringy and dry . 
i owned this watch for many years and lost it . 
but ,  they aren t very good for shooting . the angled lens distorts the view ,  especially looking through a scope . 
so when i woke up the next morning ,  to my surprise it wasn t charged . 
it was kinda creepy looking for a first baby doll when we actually got it in the mail . 
 i would say it is designed to last no longer than a couple of num_extend
worst of all the popcorn doesn t taste half as good . 
not worth even paying to send it back . 
beware .  .  .  . and it appears i m not the only one with problems . 
perhaps it would work better for a heavier person  i am num_num lbs  . 
i was hoping this would be as great as the caffeinated edition . 
i took it out of the box and threw it away . 
this mousie would be ideal if it were larger and had a different product for the tail . 
my son received this as a present for his num_extend birthday . 
it never came nor did i get any informatin regard where it may have gone . 
he gets a bit anxious when my dog barks ,  so that was the reason why i got the collar . 
the indentation have soft rounded edges ,  not the sharpness or brilliance of cut glass . 
undaunted ,  i tried it on another computer  an num_extend amd athlon  . 
iwould never buy this brand again and would not recomend it to anyone . 
the few special purpose watch tools make this kit worth the small price . 
better luck for anyone else to try it . 
i hadn t fired num_num rounds when the slings clasp near the bandoleer end failed . 
it is so thin i find that it bleeds down my lower lip . 
it does not work on the android touchscreens . 
it looks as though it is full of taste and flavorful with the different tastes and textures combined . 
with that tiny power wire  and ground wire  you prolly could get num_num watts . 
 yes ,  microsoft has a hotfix for this .  extemely frustrating . do not buy this at any price . 
i suffer from chronic neck pain from office work at a computer all day ,  poor posture ,  etc . 
made my more noticeable pimples go away but left all the smaller ones . 
thankfully ,  he did not num_extend this bench is clearly for people with physical disabilities . 
the system requirements are also way off the charts . 
it doesn t leave my skin nearly as smooth ,  it does trim the hair ,  but tugs it sometimes as well . 
tiny !  don t expect to watch video more than a couple times . 
either way i wasn t too impressed with the battery . 
the num_extend is clocked only num_num mhz higher and can be overclocked to num_num mhz . 
my blender was defective from day one  strong electrical smell ,  doesn t do what is advertised  . 
anyone claiming to have this watch with a screw down crown is lying and just copying from other reviews . 
i am not impressed . i don t know what the other reviewers are smoking . 
the main difference is the binders and fillers . i will never buy this brand again . 
it now cannot be sold in europe which bans gmo products .  .  . oh and to make it even worse . 
now i get num_num beeps ,  a wait ,  and the  pairing  . 
the alarm can t be heard num_num feet away . 
i greasy skin and my face and i think that the powder did not for me . 
not good . i know to expect vitamins to taste like vitamins . 
washed it a couple of times and it won t shrink as promised . 
my baby just didn t like the one toy . 
they are very inexpensive and come in one of those tough to open plastic clam containers . 
i bought this and a few other  crinkle  toys . 
first of ,  it took almost a month for this to arrive . 
don t fool yourself into thinking this is a cheap bike that will last you a while . 
i like the tortuga original better than this cake . 
these do last for a long time ,  which isn t really a plus since the flavors are nasty . 
it lasted about a week and my skin did peel of but it was disgusting . 
we returned and bought the rechargeable ones and love it . 
update :  i contacted amazon and they refunded my money . 
first of all ,  it doesn t fit an aquaclear num_num  or anything smaller  out of box . 
there definitely wasn t any consequence for my actions as the makers would have you believe . 
the aftertaste was too much and i genuinely did not want to finish the drink . 
i ve been looking for a raspberry flavoring without sugar or artificial sugar to make raspberry tea . 
this one looked as if it had been used . 
get lever num_num soap or dial soap to wach your acne face better . 
goes out strong it takes a while to settle ,  smell a little flowery . 
why spend $ on the exact same damn game as the other years ?  . 
don t waste your money on this piece of crap . 
its an extremely cheap case ,  i would rather use a bumper case . 
i ordered coconut milk and got something else . 
i don t hate it ,  because it is a nice lip gloss ,  but definitely not a lip plumper . 
if you like drinking watery chocolate with lots of globs of powder in it then buy this stuff . 
they had this stupid policy that you can t get a full refund if you opened it . 
there is a strict time limit that stops you from getting your  garbage ball  too big . 
the novelty of this game wears off very quickly . 
it doesnt keep liquids cold enoughf for a long ride like num_num or num_num hours . 
tea pots i have bought have the same fatal flaw . 
i purchased this after reading the reviews on this sight . 
at first he s a brave fighter ,  than he falls on his arm and breaks it apparently . 
i tried to use it for legs and bikini . 
come to find out that the snap was stuck in her leg . 
but the one they are selling here is too hard and woody . 
i put two bags of ice and lots of drinks in the cooler the day we got it . 
terrible graphics and the fact that you can t use the joystick makes it harder to play . 
however ,  i did not realize there was msg in this product ,  so i will never buy it again . 
also ,  they heat up while in the phone . 
methylisothiazolinone  mi or mit  ,  is routinely added to moisturizers ,  sun creams ,  shampoos and wet wipes . 
i checked ebay and this seems to be a common problem . 
you must have to have the stragety guide memorized in your brain to beat this . 
this speed loader fails to do its job . 
the computer whiz son had set it up but he s off on his own now . 
if you re used to primers ,  this isn t very good . 
definately not at the top of the heap . 
it s ok but not the best for me . 
it is like most of the routers around ,  especially like the linksys which i had intended to upgrade . 
both units worked for about num_num day or less ,  when they stopped working during use . 
so ,  leapfrogs fix was to send a tube topper that blocks the tube . 
sorry to say but these bulbs are very dull and a few i had to toss . 
the missions don t make any sense or have any logical order for a story . 
which i have not even seen in my account . 
the pom poms were not workable to ware . 
kind of daunting . what really makes the game horrible ,  however ,  lies within the gameplay . 
i used bragg s nutritional yeast and was looking for a cheaper option . 
i fail to understand why these cables are so expensive in us . 
the l and r buttons are reversed ,  you push the r button to scroll to the left . 
overall ,  i am disappointed that this is wearing out after only three months of use . 
finally it made a popping noise and died all together . 
the cattle industry will be the main driver of deforestation ,  it argues .    .  .  .  this is great tasting beef jerky . 
i ended up just buying a speck candyshell case that fits perfectly and protects my phone . 
the screw handle is too small and hurts fingers when used on average chains . 
you get to a region that you can actually explore . 
the real money is with the replacement blades . 
the farthest a pellet came out of this gun was about num_num feet . 
this points to being a very bad and dishonest seller . 
i bought this to grind various spices but have been very disappointed with the results . 
beat the parents comes with a folded board to play on ,  num_num pawns ,  two red and two yellow . 
i felt awful for her . other things i don t like about num_extend
the filter boxes are there but they don t work . 
i was so pleased to find at amazon . 
i unplug the cord from the pot and replug ,  nothing . 
i would never have bought it if i knew this about it . 
will either need to be returned or adjusted . 
my first one lasted three years ,  lasted up to a few days before the extended warrantee expired . 
it spilled out as i was filling my unit . 
dont buy !  !  stick with the very old smackdown games or get smackdown vs raw num_num that games the best . 
i m completely against them forcing blueray on num_extend customers . 
i tried multiple cords to see if that was the problem . 
this product is promoted as safe for puppies but my nine week old boston terrier has choked on them . 
it was a at least num_num days late i missed the full moon and i an pissed about it . 
the product looks good but the pentalobe screwdriver was a bit to big need to find one that fits . 
its just this pairis smaller than it looked and plan to return them . 
she didn t want to use it at all and wanted me to just send it back . 
the drink is refreshing but if you are thristy this num_extend can won t be enough . 
i wish it had worked for us ,  but sadly there was no change . 
i had to add some milk to mine to make it palatable . this drink combines sucralose ,   splenda  ,  and acesulfame postassium . 
i will have to call graco for a replacement pin . 
there is not a very strong chocolate taste . 
if you have nothing at all ,  this may work ,  but it s really not worth the money . 
and it was very unlikely to shatter if dropped . 
it doesn t have the same built quality of the hoya s with the same price range . 
in other words ,  the case houses a battery which charges the headset if cradled . 
at least it came with a crayon sharpener . 
when looking at these products ,  simply calculate the actual cost per square foot . 
large ear piece did not fit in my ear . 
pill pockets work well for several of my cats . 
but it was not to small to do anything you are better off digging with your hand . 
in other words i had no reason to crack it until then . 
but let s just say that you ve been warned !  . 
waste of money . update :  yesterday ,  not only did the boiling shutoff fail ,  but the emergency shutoff failed as well . 
took as directed and didn t notice a difference . 
it did not help my dandruff at all . 
i assume that if you owm low grade knives this would be ok . 
the assorted sizes are useful and other then the leaking problem they are made with decent quality . 
i wish it had stated it doesn t hold the plastic ones . 
i was so excited ,  it seemed so great and non intrusive . 
geez !  need there be more said ?  bet a newborn baby could bite a hole in these !  !  !  . 
be sure the three connections are secure before you close the phone up ,  and you shouldn t have any problems . 
easy enough to work . the birds don t drink from it . 
i use my cell phone and headset for hours of conference calls in a day . 
it s actually a lot of work to put together ,  especially for something so simple . 
there is nothing crispy about them .  .  . i ve eaten shoe boxes with more intrigue . 
i think my hair just does not do well with soaps of any kind ,  even if they are natural . 
three months after purchasing this router ,  it just stopped working . 
no support to speak of and not all that comfortable . 
it has several small cracks and is starting to leak also . 
it started to drop calls ,  lose signal ,  battery would drain quicker than normal ,  and reception in general was terrible . 
the smell is atrocious and this left my hair stiff . 
also ,  one of the nuts wouldn t thread onto the bolt ,  so we had to throw the bolt away . 
i love the material the case is made of . 
that is not enough to work with minor brands like hitachi ,  tanaka ,  or stihl .  . i have a hitachi cg num_extend
can t shoot !  well ,  have fun watching wour mash of polygons run around . 
otherwise the watch is fine but the scratches are disappointing . 
can t quite explain the aftertaste ,  but it did seem almost chemical . 
the seams are beginning to pop at multiple points . 
back to deflating the pool .  .  . hope you have time on your hands !  !  you would think deflation would be easy . 
i bought this set to replace a set of jumbo rollers by babybliss . 
perhaps the great reviews got my hopes up . 
i ordered the  refurbished  version from  happyezdeals  for my son in oregon . 
it was so loose on my phone that it fell off and was lost forever !  . 
but she can t play with it by herself . 
sorry we couldn t give these a num_num star review . 
i may have received the one in a hundred lemons as so many have commented positively on it . 
disappointing . it should be duly noted that i live in a home that has well water with very little pressure . 
am flummoxed by them now that i ve tried to use it . i can hardly find a positive thing to say . 
it was also matted and made my curls look lifeless . 
going into the sheriff s office takes you to the next num_num minute long level . 
it s from the same group that released stubbs the zombie . 
we didn t buy many gifts for my daughter for christmas and this one was a flop . 
they know it is not worth the money to return them or the bother involved . 
if this shirt wasn t cotton it would be much better as a gym shirt . 
kellogg does not use gmos in these countries . 
just awful .  .  .  . and now i m stuck with num_num more cans . 
now wireless for me is available . linksys service suck . 
this has to be the ugliest worst designed piece of plastic i ve ever seen in my life . 
do not waste your hard earned money on them . 
i bought this watch expecting a metal band ,  but instead it had a white silicone band on it . 
this charger took almost num_num weeks to arrive and then when it finally arrived the charger did not work . 
i was told the rebate would arrive within num_num weeks . 
so instead you have to manually scan it yourself with a very cumbersome control . i ran several tests . 
although the wide angle lens tends to vignette a little bit on my iphone num_extend
it also makes my already dry skin ,  much drier . 
i tested this not only by ear but against other tuners . 
i am a first time user of this type of product and bought because of the big tweezerman name . 
definitely not platinum plated; i m pretty ticked off ,  since that was the whole reason i bought them . 
there was no indication of any moisture in the packaging ,  so it didn t leak . 
it worked fine ,  i hand washed all of the parts and dried them . 
i don t know why it is so amazing . 
it has a very good taste and is a dehydrated apple without the peel . 
first of all ,  this game is for little kids . 
they last longer than regular band aids but nowhere as much as nexcare waterproof ones . 
this mango ginger habanero sauce is nothing special in my book ,  for several reasons . 
both times they lasted about num_num months before they stopped working . 
my cat is normal in size and this is so tight i m getting a different one . 
if you can find a set of these ,  pull the trigger . 
i have a chihuahua and a yorkie and they both play with it . 
guess i get to make all new backups now . 
not a good decision for the following reasons . 
the sound was fantastic ,  and when they worked they were great for phone calls . 
you get what you pay for i guess . 
it s a cute toy ,  but i ended up exchanging it for the abc bus by leapfrog instead . 
i used as instructed but saw no difference in either dog . 
i bought this product because i thought it would turn my hair blue . 
do yourself a favor and spend the extra money on a gps or laser rangefinder . 
i was not expecting real coconut milk ,  i understand it has to be pasteurized and processed to an extent . 
i beat this game on the hardest setting no problem . 
i also wasn t really fond of the amount of toe cleavage showing which i didn t see in the photos . 
it is too big ,  i got a small and it is way to big for me . 
i followed the instructions on the video listed on the package . 
loved the texture of my skin after applying it . 
do a headslam and hold square when you do it and start swimming in the air like its water . 
my advice they do keep your animal calm if you ll just shove it down your cats throat . 
they were crooked no matter how many ways ive tried . 
also they fit rather loosely on the first wear . 
i have to use the triangle button ,  but that is not even the worst aspect of this game . 
with every classic game there is a special and carefully developed gameplay system . 
i used this color years ago and was always happy with the outcome of the color . 
it was so annoying ,  as i bought the shoes for a wedding and was on my feet all night . 
while this game may be pretty fun ,  other companys offer so much more and for so much less . 
i only gave them a num_num stars because it arrived on time . 
the fact that you have to help nearly everyone in this game just as much as yourself is ridiculous . 
this consoles defeat is imminent and you don t want to own this console when that happens . 
i bought this to help releave back pain while i m sitting in my office chair at work . 
if you actually use the number pad ,  it will give you fits . 
the animations and attacks and spells almost put me to sleep ,  they are very simple and boring . 
i wanted a cheap one since i don t curl often and i guess ,  you get what you pay for . 
the first hose ripped after about num_num weeks and the rumford after about num_num weeks . 
sonic adventure one was very fun game to play ,  but like most other dreamcast titles it was flawed . 
pass on this one ,  unless doing returns and getting manufacturer help to replace it is your  thing .   . 
the one my kid fell in love with ,  which was much smaller ,  worked a lot better than this one . 
otherwise ,  this game may not be worth playing ,  unless you have a partner to help you play it . 
well ,  i was desperate for a bra lately ,  as i m recently pregnant and gaining in size .

at all !  this thing would only keep you warm only if you sat on it !  . 
they are made from bovine prostate extract and they have given me some relief . 
by the end of num_num hours i had a useless headset that isn t even good for a paper weight . 
the problem is ,  it is not straight and it is very noticeable . 
in fact just the sight of the toy sends her running to the other side of the room . 
but these tongs are basically only good for salad . 
wrong . people mentioned that the remote is very picky . 
then when you plug it in and your computer says  unknown device  you know something is definitely wrong . 
they are way too big for my small face . 
this item arrived one day late ,  defective ,  and dirty out of the box . 
the instructions have grainy ,  thumbnail sized black and white pictures and terrible ,  hard to follow writing . 
the battery door on the back of the display pops off frequently . 
i donated it to the veterans administration in a pick up with other things donated . 
they re in the donation pile to go to the local homeless shelter . 
it s too much of a hassle to return it . 
but i won t be buying another invicta anything . 
it does has service with i do this . 
this product was ultra cheap at $ however it didn t work . 
there are several ,  main problems with this product : first ,  and foremost ,  it contains methylparaben and propylparaben as preservatives . 
the night cream is smoother ,  less greasy and doesn t feel tacky at all . 
i felt that it would have been better to have easier prays at the beginning . 
i have had this item for about a year . 
we got them quickly ,  amazon is great that way ,  and the girls brought them to school on monday . 
this is just so poorly made that it simply wasn t any fun . 
this product is garbage and don t buy it .  .  . it was a waste of money . 
adjusting brightness can lead to an black screen on final dvd burn . 
i bought these so that i could watch tv while my husband sleeps .

the controls are horrible and definately the voice acting throughout % was bad . 
i don t know if its beause i don t know how it works ,  but i find it really wear . 
velodyne is a respected name in the subwoofer industry but this thing does not cut it . 
i got one to try it after reading the good reviews ,  but they re not for me . 
it feels like pulling barbed wire through your scalp . did absolutely nothing to eliminate dandruff or stimulate hair growth . 
after i used this product my hair seemed drier . 
i have also heard other stories about this same issue . 
i purchased this as a gift for some friends  son . 
so close to easter ,  i will give away to eggs to any family that wants them . 
we love tigger but i would not purchase this one if you truly want to be satisfied !  . 
i like big pearls with a business suit . 
the $ bottle of cetaphil does a better job . 
i have seen and worked on two of these for friends . 
they were hard to chew to the point where your mouth would begin to hurt . 
i would recommend buying the fake bake lotion instead . 
num_num stars for graphics those were pretty good . 
it doesn t look pretty on . perhaps a young child might like this hat . 
the wife has purchased this camisole before in different colors but wanted to try the coral color . 
i told them amazon won t and shouldn t send a num_extend replacement . 
it arrived used with scuff marks all over it and a slight worn spot on the bottom . 
the mop was overcome with dirt after i was done ,  and the bedroom was not that dirty . 
works fine to make phone have some accents to it but it does nothing to protect the phone . 
installing the provided realone player also requires you to install the realplayer software on your pc . 
i usually like watermelon flavored things ,  but this is disgusting ,  it doesn t taste like watermelon at all . 
i am using this with my lg specturm and the product seems to be hit or miss . 
they are also very strong and very smart and totally crazy when they see wild animals . 
if you manage to get it on ,  your afraid of taking it off . 
i ve never lived in the phoenix area and having my phone die at that time was the last straw . 
it didn t do an acceptable job of crushing ice anyway . 
don t know what the heck was wrong with this line . 
and the nut at the bottom of the pot pitted within a few weeks . 
i really like the new foamy soaps ,  but this one does not work very well . 
it is well built and attractive ,  but will have to be checked if on air travel . 
the ball still works and i don t think it s a choking hazard ,  but no more squeaks . 
my advice :  get the one without the button . 
a waist of money  :  looks nice ,  but doesn t worth what you pay for it . 
i would like to add that i was mixing whipping cream . 
the chunky peanut butter didn t really taste a lot like peanut butter . 
imagine bitter splenda and that about sums up the flavor . 
it has a touch screen interface including a touch screen keyboard that appears when needed . 
i normally used long tongs to lift the cover . 
there are a lot of one star reviews for a reason . 
had high hopes for this but just not right for me . 
took this product and did not work for me . 
the stainless steel bottom shown in the illustration looked really neat ,  but the pot itself is plastic ,  not glass . 
they are now using a spring steel plate wrapped with plastic . 
as an everyday patrol boot or operator boot these things wear out in a year . 
will i buy ?  not sure ,  but at least it is good for something . 
the cowl behind the mirror is plastic ,  not polymer . 
just looking at the filter you can tell the difference in quality . 
when i ordered this product ,  i was not aware that it contained sucralose . 
wonder why .  .  . the whole time limit thing was also retarded . 
the graphics are good ,  the gameplay is smooth ,  the ai is very well done . 
if you can t get anything right ,  at least make your protagonist s main weapon interesting . 
i would never buy this item again !  the quality and fitting are horrendous .  .  . wish i could have returned them . 
it s not something i d buy again and i think there are a lot better choices out there . 
there were numerous places where it had prominent and sizeable scratches in the finish . 
it s now on my back porch as i hate the smell of burnt popcorn . 
none of us heard any significant sound difference . but if it makes you happy why not right ?  . 
they suggest running num_extend from a clean boot without running anything else before . 
these had good reviews so i ordered a pair . 
we have three indoor cats ,  all quite different in temper . 
i got this product in hopes of using it with my very heavy ,  very large num_extend downhill mountain bike . 
my experience with this product was not effective in terms of providing moisture and improving the hair . 
have been targeting .  .  . but these liquid pencils are just as horrible as the eraser mate pens back in the num_extend
product only works with a phone that does not have a belt clip . 
they found it weird that my husband s verizon iphone num_extend as mine  had full service and full wifi service . 
for example ,  the first boss is identical to andross  main boss in the snes and num_num versions  . 
spectrum light canola mayo is an eggless mayonnaise substitute . 
the microphone on this thing is terrible . i am returning the pop handset for a refund . 
if you do buy it ,  make sure you can buy the real thing later . 
go to a retail store and buy the bigger and less cheap looking one . 
i played with it inside trying to get comfortable with using both the chatter call and the distress call . 
it won t move the cursor to where i want it to be and it s very frastrating sometimes . 
the vet said it was too strong a product and i should go with a product more gentle . 
this case is rigid plastic and rubber with virtually no pliability . 
i also notice the price went up since i purchased making the whole deal less than a value . 
i would love to compare this game but since activision isn t doing that i won t either . 
you can choose which roles to have which party members specialize in ,  and form a group to your liking . 
apparently the pistol is to wide to fit where the num_extend apparently fits . 
maybe i just got a defective pair ,  but i m not gonna give them a second chance . 
crosman is notorious for making horrible guns ,  and this is one of them . 
how could i go wrong ?  well ,  you get what you pay for . 
whatever you put into the toaster either pops out burnt or not toasted enough . 
i notice a bunch of flakes beneath my eyes by lunchtime and smears of color throughout the day . 
the fact that these are taupe without pink is what drew me to these . 
this product does cover ok but don t buy it if you have sensitive skin . 
that started off fun but there should have been more flexibility . 
we used this product on a sony vaio running num_extend
i wear a size num_num shoe and ordered a size num_extend from another retailer . 
well ,  this decaf was soooo bad that several people actually commented that it was the worst they d ever had . 
it s not like i don t know what i m doing . i ve had nothing but headaches with this drive . 
i sent a message to the seller with no response . 
reasons are that i wasn t thrilled with the lack of bass ,  volume levels and interference issues . 
gba is the only worthwile portable system ,  having classic snes and nes games available to play anywhere you want . 
it s the only mario kart i didn t want to play for at least a week . 
there are  flexible  chews for sale ,  i worry much less with those in his mouth . 
i like the design and idea behind the mouse . 
 ays  could be say ,   bal  could be lab backwards ,   bos  could be sob . 
bottom line ,  want to scare and alienate your pets ,  family and friends . 
i purchased this motorola bluetooth to go with my motorola phone . 
it comes with num_num different comb attachments for cutting different lengths and specialty combs for cutting around your ears . 
i am back looking at reviews again for a new pair and using the ipod ones again . 
i wanted to like this item and had seen the generally favorable reviews . 
it was like i was wearing nothing at all . 
a lot of bags i saw that were under $ i did not like . 
luckily i had my benchmade to cut the steak . 
it consists of num_num  i think  areas ,  that are each about the size of a football field . 
other brands have statements that they were produced under gmp standards and were tested for heavy metals . 
there a newer company that is trying to get there name out there . 
i have the decagon and the hexagon and love both of them . 
i found this out and had to stop and do the paint job by hand . 
we received this for my daughter s birthday this year ,  and i have to say i was not impressed . 
every kirkland product i ve seen advertised on amazon is overpriced . 
one of the best things about this set was that the animals were durable and easy to clean . 
it did seem to have a slight vanilla flavor ,  but nothing like i would have expected or preferred . 
unfortunately ,  there is no way to make a strong coffee in any quantity in this machine . 
the first day it was fine ,  if a bit sensitive ,  by the third day it was broken . 
well in this game tidus and the gang thought up something new . 
maybe it s because tea really needs to steep for awhile in order to have great flavor . 
what a disappointment !  hardly any product in the tube and it didn t do squat for my eyelashes . 
cable box control only goes up to channel num_extend so not much use in the digital cable markets . 
num_num stars for its ability to land in the ditch without any problems . 
review is for adorama and not the filter . thanks adorama . 
i just with i could return this toy . 
there s no murdering ,  raping ,  pillaging ,  or anything that was synonymous with pirates . 
flakes are way to thick and didn t even soften up in milk . 
but don t confuse yourself ,  if you buy this game you have committed an act of idiocy . 
if you feel the same way i suggest you don t purchase this one . 
even then you will probably have to remove your water bottle holder . 
so i forged ahead ,  thinking of the times i ve returned an opened package of perfectly good merchandise . 
it smudged as soon as i left the house this morning . 
this boring waste of money is one of the best games to make you fall asleep . 
to receive one with two separate ,  easily noticeable flaws is very disappointing . 
my bodyweight was basically reacting the same as it did before i took these . 
its all really really bad and not just one brand either !  !  !  !  . 
by any means necessary stay away from this product !  !  . 
the stereo imaging is good ,  but that s the only good thing i can say about them . 
i tried it at different times of day to see if that made a difference . 
for my kind of riding ,  its a piece of junk ,  save your money . 
i shouldn t have to modify a product ,  just to be able to use it all . 
if it can t handle being shipped ,  do you really think up to num_extend dog won t get out of it . 
i recently purchased this hoping it would be good . 
strawberry ,  lemon ,  orange and raspberry . the caloric content is only num_num calories for num_num pieces . dietary fiber :  num_extend
you get num_num num_num oz cans for num_num dollars . 
they both ran into the kitchen and had looks of fright on their faces . 
the rubber is soft ,  and the toy is a little heavier than i had expected . 
the first shipment came ,  and it had only a num_num month expiration left . 
you really have to get it done in about num_num seconds before it dries . 
it was played with for about num_num minutes ,  then never touched again . 
i also don t like coconut water ,  so maybe it has the same taste to it . 
there is nothing wrong with the product itself ,  but i wouldn t buy this again . 
i bought this bag for a num_extend laptop mbp ,  an extra battery ,  a spare hd ,  and some papers . 
i kept this bra for the days i have to wash my other bra ,  but i hate wearing it . 
i tried this product ,  faithfully followed the directions ,  and repeated process multiple times over a couple of months . 
the game has no good points that i can think of . 
even after all of that ,  my ears still sagged with the earrings . 
i loved this case cause it fit my tmobile num_extend  ,  plus my headphones and extra battery . 
the good ,  the bad and the ugly here : the num_extend
i placed it near the cat food to get the kitties used to it . 
they re pretty ,  but unlike most apple products ,  these basically suck . 
after a very short time the magnet separates and causes the impeller to stop turning . 
they re also really big fyi  long ,  go real far up your leg  . 
once you ve got the animal attached to the helicopter ,  you fly them to safety . 
tried a million matti fires ,  most are useless . 
i like the small tip ,  length ,  weight ,  gel pen writing smoothness ,  look and feel of the stylus . 
when that happens audio quality is pretty good . 
i ve had many phone charging cases over the years . 
many people also claim this is a  protein free  styling gel . 
i am generally a fan of mac and cheese ,  though i typically go for the sharp cheddar variety . 
i will never use this socket unless i own a diesel truck . 
i needed a bigger and reliable portable charger . 
or if you have the money just invest in a mac paint pot . 
the tabs are meant for use with a laptop screen that has a bezel of some sort around it . 
i took these for three months and noticed no differences in my weight . 
over time since i ve gf i ve learned that some gf flours taste funky ,  sour or just plain nasty . 
while this product didn t make his condition any worse ,  it didn t do anything to make it better . 
that gets old quick ,  even with graphics and music as engaging as ds s . my advice :  wait for nwn or morrowind . 
it s so fricking annoying to not be able to find a decent tank top anywhere because of it . 
we liked the neck version made by the same company a lot better . 
unfortunately ,  they didn t know the manufacturer had changed the product formula . 
i m thinking that s this has to be like a placebo or psychosomatic for people . 
the install guide was the best i ever read . only one problem ,  it didn t work . 
i didn t expect much from this game ,  giving the bad reviews . 
you wouldn t even be able to force it ,  it would just break . 
let s just hope microsoft doesn t buy out sierra anytime soon . 
where to begin with this mess .  .  . let s begin with the dungeons . 
get some good fence nippers ,  they work better . 
so now the unit is useless since there is no way i can charge it anymore . 
way to much money for what you get . 
there seams to be something wrong with the hinge that open and closes . 
well .  .  .  . i read many of the bad reviews and thought  it can t be that bad  . 
i did not like the padding ,  nor the strapslides in the front . 
with amazon i do not worry about buying products because their return happen fast and without any problems . 
i am a huge fan of the original lashblast ,  but this was hugely disappointing . 
but ,  to each her own !  i had no problems with the seller ,  it was the product itself . 
the pulp clogs the the  filter  mechanism leading to lots of lost juice . 
very dissapointing maybe i should have stuck with the more expensive ones . 
the fellow at radio shack tested with his meter and confirmed that the fuse was dead . 
so the bad people are looking for the num_num princesses to open the ultimate door . 
this was a replacement for one of my speakers . 
i ended up not using is at all . would not recommend this kit . 
i ve played it four times ,  and i ve begun to believe it s both more and less complex than i thought . 
he loves to chew everything so i was surprised that he sniffed this and kept walking . 
think of navi or the owl from legend of zelda ocarina of time except num_num times worse . 
i never had a mechanical problem and my first couple of months with the product were uneventful . 
you will find yourself fiddling with the filters in the game alot . 
i was disappointed because i have a serpa for my beretta num_extend storm fs and it works fine . 
i wouldn t recommend these and certainly wouldn t buy them again . 
i thought the rest of the game was great . 
it is surprising electronic arts could have ever thought up something this stupid . 
the tea did something wonky to my taste buds . 
it can pair up with multiple devices at the same time . 
the can work with any digital photo on file . 
i got the tangerine ,  as the lavendar was too strongly scented . 
they want me to upgrade firmware a third time . 
the concept of this is great ,  unfortunately it gets boring within about half hour . 
it s basically an iced ,  sweetened coffee drink around espresso strength . 
thankfully ,  it s lingering medicine aftertaste went away quickly . 
the rawhide bones in this picture look num_num times bigger than what they actually are . 
glad i didn t pay tooooo much for it . 
buy it  garmin dash mount  through amazon and enjoy . 
of course ,  linksys will not refund any money at this point so i can purchase a working unit . 
so i tried adding some splenda to see if that would help ,  mmmm ,  just a tad . 
it isn t helpful in keeping the pantry organized . 
i ve tried this chocolate a few times and it feels like a cheaply produced ,  chemical infused excuse for chocolate . 
i bought this amazon prime thinking that would mean it was a genuine ,  oem ,  uniden battery . 
the flower for the hat has not stayed on the hat from day one . 
there are much healthier choices like innova evo ,  felidae ,  natural balance ,  etc . 
i have no doubt that this is a totally accurate simulation of riding a num_num wheeler . 
this portable certainly plays loudly enough but reception ,  particularly on the fm band ,  is not good . 
i love the gameplay but the graphics are even worse than num_extend
iriver has just ,  this day ,  responded to my concern . 
so i thought these might do the trick . 
unfortunately ,  this case will not work for me as my phone is a num_extend and not a num_extend
i want a good quality sock ,  but also need accurate sizing . 
a num_num star miracle it is not  !  a num_num star almost miracle .  .  . again ,  not even close . 
i bought this because i was trying to save money instead of buying another littermaid . 
i m truly surprised by all the good reviews here . 
jazz was my favorite character in the movie . 
i was about num_num feet into a moderate paced run when they fell out . 
i mean i would still wear it then i found another cologne i liked and totally stop using it . 
i am dissapointed that a high class company like cuisinart makes such a poor quality product . 
 digging the eggs out of the elasticized belly  . 
so ,  kitty that i actually can t stand it . 
maybe it would work fine with the subscription . 
smooth moves is the first title i actually bought . 
this thing has been cracked and broken so much i won t even attempt to use it anymore . 
the trigger was a bit long and hard for target shooting ,  as others have said . 
my hair had been previously dyed with permanent haircolor a while back . 
each program is better than the last ,  but only slightly . 
i have some old pie pans from baker s square and this shield fits them . 
i would never have ordered it if i had realized that it was hard . 
i would recommend you to get something stronger and pay a little more . 
at about $ per bar for usual price ,  they re not worth it . 
do yourself a favor and avouid them at all costs . 
i did not have a good experience with this product . 
this was to replace a one year old battery in my daughters num_extend
the stickers come off and there are no extras . 
now i am out of us and i cannot even claim warrenty . total waste of money . 
overall ,  for the price and the performance ,  i am disappointed . mindy weiss . 
then you upgrade to a num_extend num_num months later . 
they should stop claiming that on the packaging . 
i was expecting a large hand sized horse hair sized brush for serious boot polishing . 
i hope anyone who takes this sees their cycles improve . 
i wanted to use this to cover some dark acne marks . 
i am so disappointed to spend this kind of money and waste it . 
my daughter has used it several times this winter and seems to really like it . 
in may num_extend it was hard green chunks ,  blue s response . 
ended in the trash num_num weeks after it arrived . 
should be placed on the top of the camera like a real camera would be . 
these boxes are okay for winter time use . 
the orange was sort of ,  well ,  orange but the taste was less pronounced . 
very light weight in texture i sent them back . 
i tried taking it back  in original packaging  and toysrus wouldn t honor their return policy . 
each level honestly takes fewer than num_num minutes ,  so you will probably complete a chapter in all of num_extend
this stuff is not sticky at all ,  which is what i had been hoping for . 
buy a $ cotton towel and save yourself $
if the shoe is too tight ,  i can usually stretch it to make it comfortable . 
the ms brand battery is the best on the market . 
my advice to the seller :  make it clear which promax disc brakes accept these pads . 
please ensure that your computer is online and try again .   . 
as for the mixer ?  num_num years of steady use and still going strong !  . 
there is no variety in this game whatsoever . 
i used to have a few ,  now i know better . 
i don t recommend it .  .  .  . get something a little stronger . 
you can t even use this machine with soy milk products . 
do i think that it s a good toy ?  it is the cheapest looking piece of nothing i ve ever seen . 
between those notches the speed increases at a variable rate . 
i received this today ,  and had ordered it because sometimes i crave the taste of baba ghannoche . 
get something contemporary unless you have a bunch of num_num year old equipment . 
i give the skillet away to my housekeeper . 
especially given the steep price ,  i do not recommend this set of vehicles . 
i would have given this num_num stars but that didn t appear to be an option on the amazon . com form . 
i hid this in peanut butter ,  flavored rice ,  chicken soup broth ,  even in turkey pieces . 
in my case . now i m out twenty bucks plus the price of the new ones . 
unfortunately it did not work and after several weeks i resorted to surgery anyway . 
don t know why ,  but buffy would not eat this particular flavor of food . 
and the battery that came with the phone gives me just as many hours as use as this does . 
i notice just a subtle difference ,  so i will give it two stars . 
i warn you ,  do not even look at this game . 
the sims speak in some kind of jibberish . 
i havent personally tried it but i hear that st . 
then within two days my cats had torn the birdie apart . 
after about num_num rounds ,  the small part of the flap that is part of the hinge cracked completely off . 
you can also collect and purchase weapons like guns and magic spells . 
season is likely a factor in fresh foods . 
it galls me to pay $ for a tiny piece of plastic but it s worth it . 
it worked for num_num months without any issue and it stoped working since then . 
my own fault for not cleaning the screen well enough . 
the provided rca web link does not even work !  ! the video is very poor . 
very little pressure coming out of the flow nozzles at all . 
mine is the heavier one with smooth handles . 
with this new charger the cord is out of the way when i m through using it . 
it makes all kinds of grinding noises ,  sometimes slowing down to a crawl then speeding up again . 
i say  try  because the flower has never stayed on her hat for more than three seconds . 
it is always getting air in the motor and it will stop working . 
the broth is tasty ,  with the addition of a little more salt and pepper . 
now i look like i have a catepillar above each eye . 
well ,  as other reviewers have written ,  hasbro did not do a good job on princess celestia . 
as i sat in the sun today it has lightened a little . 
num_num dented the targets and knocked this thing over . 
this didn t taste great on any of them . 
look for a product that is hypoallergenic if you know you are sensitive; that your eyes become irritated easily . 
mowing down demon soliers in a suburban neighborhood should be alot funner than this . 
there is also a lot of food waste inside the shredder cone . 
it broke today where the head connects to the arm . 
and that shortly fades once whats left in the battery wears out . 
has fallen from windshield several times ,  not an overall good quality product . 
nevertheless ,  i love the style of their bras ,  and i bought this for fun ,  not long wear . 
in first game every tribe had a different bonus unique to it . overall the game play is just bad . 
low ,  stable heel but stylish enough for a dressy opera date . 
after several uses ,  the lid forms a vacuum each time and is very difficult to remove . 
cheaply constructed and did not solve the problem i wanted it to solve . 
needless to say ,  i was in extreme discomfort . so ,  this was a big disappoint for me . 
buy a canon num_extend or num_extend or num_extend and you will be much more happy . 
while the graphics are good among the best on num_extend the game itself is long ,  tedious ,  and boring . 
my brother beat this game for a friend it is horrible . 
very sweet ,  limited carbonation ,  and tastes a bit like maraschino syrup used for mixed drinks . 
to quote  somebody s  grandfather ,   what s not to like ?   . 
it was not doing anything for her for fleas . 
the capuccino is heavy on the stevia and is so horribly sweet ,  my mouth sticks together . 
i recommend urban decay or too faced primer instead . 
the stainless steel resembles tin ,  finish is unsatisfactory ,  easily bent ,  and they are lightweight . 
the replacement back supplied with this product does not fit the cx models . 
i ve been a networking professional for almost num_num years . 
most of this is off top of my head as i set it up . 
i don t know what i was expecting .  .  . but this wasn t it . 
i ordered the correct size and num_num different colors . 
i ve been using clairol natural instincts hair coloring for years and years and years and have always loved it . 
 insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results . 
there are bits of fig in the cookie ,  but it is hard and not really appealing . 
instead ,  my response to it falls somewhere between indifferent and disgusted . 
not a single one could be tightened such that i was unable to squeeze air out of it . 
she s good for a few minutes then gives up even though she ll get food from it . 
you can probably find used num_extend for way less than the prices here if you really want it . 
do not be swayed by the occasional glowing review . 
if you look at the photo you see a paddle behind the holster but the main title says belt . 
this face wash made my face very dry . 
several other major brands also tested positive for this junk . 
sadly i had to gift my soups that only arrived just today !  . 
it burns like crazy and the itching is worse than before i inserted the darn thing . 
the ovulation tests from the drug store always coincide with the monitor . 
so bad that i had to use a burn gel !  . 
instead ,  i was a bit weirded out by the product itself . 
the psp tries to do more but it s practically worthless at doing them . 
im stuck using the messed up one i received . 
this radio right out of the box did not work properly . 
she was very disappointed when the nail polish didn t come off like it should have . 
i m not sure how to describe the smell ,  it kind of smells like a really bad wine . 
no matter how many times i washed it the food would have a plastic taste after cooking . 
good news :  it works . bad news :  it works too much . anything at all will trip it and make it go off . 
it is full of dirt and twigs and whatever other debris they chose to throw in . 
but that is it and not really what a plug is suppose to do . 
regarding softness  ,  it does make your skin so soft . 
i will primarily use this while driving and it doesn t block much noise . 
seems like a simple fix and something that should have been noticed . 
the layout of the game is very confusing as well . 
unless you don t like them that much ,  you might not want to give these to anyone . pass on these . 
it deflated quickly after the first inflation because the screw cap was not fully tightened . 
it wasted a lot of bubble fluid also . 
the unit was dead and had to be sent back for rma . 
this product only works if you glob it on . 
well ,  i played roller coaster tycoon num_num and couldnt get enough of it . 
i got it home set it up and it doesn t work . 
i examined the walls inside the dishwasher ,  it is all over . 
the vet said to check the kitty s poo to make sure it passed . 
i would give it zero stars but that is not an option . 
it was very wide and stiff and uncomfortable . 
unfortunately that one went to good will and now i am stuck having to go buy another . 
as most other reviewers have already pointed out this wild bird feeder is not designed properly . 
i was so happy with it ,  that i bought this one ,  thinking it was a leap forward . 
maybe this was just a case of me not being a good match for this bra . 
there are better options ,  and certainly better prices ,  for front and rear protectors . 
has a horrible smell i can only imagine how it tastes . 
i think it will be better when we can stuff it with cheese and play outside . 
before too long ,  it ceases to be challenging and just gets annyoing . 
i ve mostly purchased my dance shoes in person ,  so can try them on in the store for fit . 
my phone is already a handset in and of itself . 
i had to get out and finish shaving at the sink . 
the handle broke as soon as i started pumping . 
they shrunk so much i could not get them to stretch out big enough to cover the front teeth . 
the first time i used it with a single batch of pasta ,  the motor got very hot . 
i had this product for over num_num weeks . 
the beater bar would bog down on carpet . 
the old pair is crystal clear . i m very disappointed in this new version . 
i ve had better luck with a pair of fine tip metal tweezers . 
why doesn t trimedica put in big letters ,  % pure . 
boiling water and you ll feel just like new . 
this game is a miserable excuse for an addition to the mega man x series . 
i read great reviews on it ,  but i guess it s just not for me . 
first thing i disliked about the product was the horrible smell . 
when i first got the case i thought it was really cute . 
i have come to realize the more i used this shampoo bar ,  the more buildup i had . 
but that is probably exactly why no effort is put into such a venture . the smell . 
my grandaughter loves hello kitty ,  but not this one . 
it went from the coolest game ever ,  to the coolest game ever with the stupidest sequal . 
yes ,  i am going through an audio receiver . 
the tin could easily have contained num_num or num_num fish of this size . 
have tried everything and cannot get it to function . 
i can t imagine any other way something this bad could have gotten out in the field . 
once you get one side snapped in ,  the other side pops off ,  and vice versa . 
it is a nice router in all ways but one . 
i think the construction could be a little different . 
and the person on the other end states they have an echo . 
i clean my nails with a nail brush just prior to num_extend
if feels exactly like it does when i eat a food i have an intolerance for . 
i m gonna pick one size smaller next time . 
the mixer did not work when we inserted new batteries ,  correctly . 
the puzzles and tasks are either pointless or impossibly difficult or both . 
there are never any decisions at all to be made in clr  center left right ,  null  . 
it tastes good ,  especially when it is ice cold ,  and dissolves just fine without a blender . 
not happy !  the game wont start in my psp . 
not quite greasy ,  but more like the slippery  gardener s gloves  products . 
what s more ,  when adding this splenda to hot drinks it really fizzles ,  almost as if adding something carbonated . 
only came with adhesive   double stick tape type   that fit the top and bottom ,  not the sides . 
i have been able to set the hour ,  but not the minuets . 
perhaps all this stray rf is confusing it since i ve tried num_num different remote extenders and neither works . 
i have num_num grandkids that are active and get injured often . 
it s hard to describe why; it just feels bulky and awkward . 
i had to add another pair of thick wool socks to the one s i was already wearing . 
for a war game ,  i d expect a game with better graphics than this . 
for num_num bucks you cant really complain  . i would have bought it again for the price tag . 
not as a big diet plan or anything like that . 
i am not satisfied with this razor at all . 
the bottle shown is not the one you will get just fyi . 
the cups of this bra are ridiculously small . 
i was on the phone with tech support for an hour . 
bfv they were crazy sensitive ,  num_extend they felt like you were flying with your hands numb . 
of the num_num softgels ,  about num_num of them were cracked or had chipped . 
i can t seem to get am stereo channels even when i properly installed all the connections . 
i hadn t used a zagg product for years ,  so i decided to give them a try again . 
i wanted to try this out for it s energy boosting effects . 
tech help even changed my computer settings and it took me a while to reconfigure it . 
licorice is my favorite candy ,  and it promotes good digestion . 
it s the first time i m truly disappointed with amazons policy of cramming everything in as few boxes as possible . 
the duel blade aren t aligned well ,  so whatever your slicing gets caught between the blades . 
furthermore ,  the chocolate coating tasted like poor quality chocolate . 
but for me thats all that was needed . 
i just want to break down and cry when i hear people call this a final fantasy . 
i ll touch the screen and it ll open an app with so much lag . 
less noisy than the other unit i have . 
i have owned this wireless card for about num_num months . 
pleasant enough to use ,  i don t find it is helpful to my skin; just not harmful . 
if it does ,  the strength of this product leaves much to be desired . 
this stuff bears no resemblance to ramyun ,  maybe that s why they changed the name to ramen . 
be aware !  this keyboard is not  ergonomic  at all . 
i use them to go under my boxing ,  or mma gloves during practice . 
this sounded perfect for my dry skin ,  especially as winter approaches . 
if you have a small animal it is fine ,  but if it likes to swim at all . 
i had to put paper behind it to make it work . 
i purchased multiple units ,  and it will cost me more to return to amazon than it s worth . 
you will not find this many people playing one game at the same time anywhere else ,  period . 
i had heard quite a few good things about this product as well . 
this thing is hands down the worst protein bar i ve ever had in my life . 
this model is without any real quality components . 
the film will now not get caught on anything and ripped off because it s covered by the glossy protector . 
not only is the salt unhealthy but it just tastes like you are sucking down cheese flavored salt ! ick . 
everything works ,  video conferencing ,  audio communication ,  print server . 
ive seen other ,  smaller capsules but they may have been a smaller dosage . 
there didn t really need to be a character change in the game . 
the post office is not and its not shipped in a protected package . 
i also have very hard water with a lot of minerals in it which made the tea cloudy . 
i went through severl procedures with jabra ,  who ultimately replaced the headset ,  all without success . 
the unit was not flat on the bottom so it wobbled . 
i always look for by products but didn t think to even bother to check the next num_num ingredients . 
i have large hands but even for me the trackball is simply way too large . 
it did smell good ,  decent bounce ,  but not tuff enough for our boy . 
you get one touch out of it and then tiny flashes to no light at all . 
i bought three pairs of millers forge scissors . 
i couldn t even get near him with the clicker in my hand because it freaked him out . 
i was so excited about this cereal when i tried it . 
other than that ,  some of the scents in skincare products are actually quite nice . 
they would lick the treats but weren t willing to actually consume them . 
they fit my phone just fine ,  but after you apply them it makes the screen a funny color . 
i don t taste a very strong espresso flavor . 
i bought a bunch of these for under $
there s an unscented version and a lavender one . 
the balance trainer itself reminds me of a flattened ,  underinflated playground ball . 
the buttons don t work properly and it fits very poorly . 
in the product s defense ,  i probably should have used it longer . 
it comes out of the tube like light tan pancake make up and is thick like toothpaste . 
the price was ok had this worked good and felt more comfortable . 
not something i want ,  especially in the eye area !  it almost feels like the beginnings of a stye . 
i would not recommend it to women with large breasts . 
the reviews were so positive ,  and i thought the vanilla would have to make it wonderful no matter what . 
if you want another disappointment from microsoft ,  buy some  games for windows live  games . 
you must wear additional ear plugs using this at least for indoor range or anything powerful . 
there are some praiseworthy elements in this game ,  such as the visuals . 
i checked the fuses and it is not a fuse . 
i would give it three stars maybe four stars after customizing to my needs . 
maybe next time i try it i won t roll ,  but dab and then see how it is . 
at this price range i usually wear naturalizer . 
even if this case did withstand a little water it s design is unintelligent . 
eight months is really a ridiculously short amount of time for something like this to work . 
i personally will return to a roof rack for all my bikes . 
the connection started getting bad and i had to constantly wiggle the wires to get it to work . 
i purchased this item on march num_extend num_extend i have successfully used it about num_num times since then . 
 mediabridge num_num ft  they have it here for $ and it is so much better !  . 
it s unbelievably handy to have at hand ,  even in this day of microwave ovens . 
its been several years since you had region codes for dvd and cds . 
i gave this to my num_extend dog twice a day for two weeks and it did not stop itching . 
amazon issued a refund and i m throwing these away . 
it may be a total piece of crap . 
these glasses arrived unbalanced ,  with lopsided bases and uneven rims . 
it now only takes a few minutes for all the water to drip out . 
i left my phone overnight and it died on the cable plugged into a laptop . 
the notch doesn t line up with the camera ,  and the screen is hardly covered . 
that s less than a year !  do not buy this model . 
i like essie products but not this one . 
my neighbor ,  standing num_num doors down ,  said he could barely hear it . 
i received this set of ratchet cars along with the full race track kit that can be purcahsed separately . 
the hub dhcp server died in less than six months . 
sony thanks god that the world is full of stupid people . 
they arrived and then i discovered they are extremely irritating to set up . 
my son had a drawer full and they lasted years . 
this is the most artificial tasting coconut water that i ever had . 
it wasn t unpleasant exactly but it wouldn t go away either . 
also potentially dangerous for someone relying solely on this num_extend burns through batteries quickly . 
that s true :  coconut oil is mixed with diethanolamine to make cocamide dea . 
my hair stayed the same and then seemed limp and actually thinner . 
i was very excited when i brought pow home and placed the disc in my xbox . 
they just don t work well at all and are hard to use to get any sort of shape . 
i did get my refund when requesting a return ,  so it wasn t a total loss . 
this thing sucked !  !  it no where near fit our phones . 
it was beyond the return period ,  so i had to buy something else . 
it wasn t hardly worth my effort to send it back . 
texture is really important to me when it comes to fruit snacks ,  and these are more hard than gummy . 
and after it s done .  .  . there is a long space before you hear the beeps to indicate you can use it . 
i ordered the premium bling luxurious design diamont crystal case and did not get that . 
the picture looks so healthy great balanced nutrition . 
my height is as average as a guy can be at num_num feet . 
the reviews were good so i bought this based on that information . but i cannot gag this stuff down . 
the headphones even had this hum when they weren t plugged into the headphone jack . 
i poured half of it into a bowl ,  microwaved it .  .  . and it just tasted awful . 
but if wantaction and in depth story look elsewhere . 
within a few uses ,  it seemed to get even duller . 
i was so disappointed when i tried it . 
unfortunately ,  catwoman will surface on store shelves before this review appears . 
when i heard of a num_extend version of clive barker s undying i began to drool . 
i purchased this because my num_num year old cat has become so skinny and needs extra calories . 
but the taste does not rise above bland . 
she also didn t like the smell of the cleanser . 
the watch band is also starting to fall apart . 
after reading reviews ,  i was excited to get this food for my num_num year old cat . 
i never had a problem with the original taste . 
it could lose num_extend of seconds a day . 
i found this game to be hard in a group of people who don t like to be dishonest . 
the metal that it is made from is so soft that you can bend it just by touching it . 
it looks sharp ,  is comfortable ,  and it looked like it would put up with years of use and abuse . 
i had never played myst before and i wanted to give it a try because of its popularity . 
most heart pieces are pretty challenging to acquire and take some serious effort to get most of them . 
ok i was excited to get this but when it came in !  it was beat up really bad . 
there is an extremely subtle coconut flavor but it s barely there . 
i find it similar to a very thin sweat shirt without that fuzzy stuff on the inside . 
i ll write a review on that one too after i ve used it for a bit . 
i m looking for a sock that has thick cushioning on the soles . 
better for electric guitar but still hard to play fast . 
worst of all ,  though ,  was that the product dripped ,  and i didn t realize it . 
so as far as this base coat goes . 
i cannot recommend this to coconut water lovers . but ,  hey ,  i like to at least try other brands . 
i thought i was getting the same thing . 
i just don t love that they are so impossible to store . 
i checked ,  and all were in the same lot . 
it still looks cakey no matter what though . 
i d give the game num_extend stars ,  but since i can t it only gets num_extend
what i received was the headset in a zip lock bag . 
while is wasn t horribly expensive ,  i expected to last a bit longer than this . 
i didn t see the logic behind this garment . 
this item is total junk make no mistake about it . 
sony must consider this to be a disposable product ,  it certainly was not made to last . 
all of a sudden ,  my camera could not function properly . 
not all the metal parts are stainless so they get pitted and retain food particles . 
this was the most expensive oil control product that i ve ever purchased so i guess i expected more . 
keyboard is often unresponsive ,  along with the mouse . 
various combinations of plugging and unplugging the drive ,  powering up and down ,  unmounting the drive ,  etc . 
she looks and smells cleaner just doing her business in the paper bedding material that i use . 
this works just fine and i will not buy these again . 
it was like a ant freeway with at least num_num or more for each foot of travel . 
but the first night i tried and it seemed a failure . 
this was one of the more awkward things that i ve tried on her .  .  . and it didn t stop her from pulling . 
if it had a flat mirror i would give it five stars . 
no matter what i tried ,  it beaded up . 
the water moves better ,  the ships are more animated and umm that s about it . 
however ,  they are not compatable with the bose num_num speaker system . 
have now moved on to foam beds with  egg crate  tops . 
but honestly they keep leaving me disappointed . me ,  i am a num_num year old with combination skin . 
although zoe also doesn t like bloodworms so maybe she s just picky . 
except for the turbo maze this product is a total waste of money . 
the powder is pretty course and doesn t blend well at num_extend
it reminded us of strawberry sparkling cider ,  though switch s  fizz  content is somewhat less . 
it made me look weird like a yellowish tone . 
i decided to take a chance on these inserts and i am very disappointed . 
i returned the stone for a refund less than num_num hours later . 
if you love popular american radio music ,  be my guest . 
the tallest part of the tower is several single num_extend bricks wide with num_extend bricks on either side . 
we also use only some of the sections of the post ,  to get it to the right height . 
i have purchased a different type trimmer that cost $ more but works much better . 
something kept in the family for safe keeping . 
it did require a little trimming at the bottom ,  but that was easily accomplished with my baby exacto knife . 
i honestly don t know what i saw in this game . 
i am not weak ,  but i struggled to get the hooks on and off the wires . 
what makes this fake is that your last saved checkpoint is where the game will automatically start you anyway . 
so i have to use the competing brand for most of my equipment . 
they should last for decades and not begin decaying after the first use . 
few days later i used the compressor to pump up my bike . 
this one is too hard to make level as you are dragging through the cake . 
i probably got num_num uses out of it . 
the handle is tarnished with little bubbles in the finish . 
i don t expect it to last long . and it s just plain ugly . 
i hate this headset ,  but after num_num bucks i refuse just to throw them away . 
dont you hate the way these companies discreetly add in an animal product into an otherwise unseemingly vegan product . 
they are now using a spring steel plate wrapped with plastic . 
and the oldest is still going after num_num years . 
felt a bit snug ,  tho my size hadn t changed . 
i may be doing some sewing and recreating this castle with real canvas fabric . 
from what i ve read ,  this product has since been discontinued . 
if you re interested in accurate models ,  try a different brand . 
 ,  and i am giving the manufacturer  time  to produce firmware that solves my problems . 
after using this item my machete may be slightly less dull ,  but it is far from sharp . 
it tastes kind of like chemicals or plastic . 
i even liked the music ,  and they got william shatner to narrate the mission intros . now ,  the bad parts . 
however ,  more treated cats than control cats developed moderate to severe disease during week num_extend
our cats get the crazy face when they play with da bird or cat catcher mouse . 
these are constructed entirely different than the boot cut jeans . 
all for naught ,  the damned bubbles were in the skin . 
the sound was somewhat boomy but if you like a little extra base it was ok . 
this one is very watery and i could not find any lobster there . 
the inside of this stained black after one use . 
i only got to use this dvd player about num_num times . 
mario ,  metroid ,  zelda ,  starfox .  .  . surprise surprise its the usual suspects . 
why risk it if you don t have to ?  . 
google it and u will see it is also called wolfsbane .  .  . what they used to kill wolves with . 
i love organic cotton ,  but this shirt needs some lycra . 
i only took one pill and it made me sick . 
otherwise the sound is what you get by blowing into a straw . 
it s good material though and arrived on time . 
i personally will never deal with sony online entertainment  soe  ever again . 
please don t get this by mistake if you want to hack the firmware . 
the top of the phone screen is squared corners and the bottom is rounded . 
then strange repetitive whirring and clicking sounds developed . 
the item i received was refurbished and at that time that was not mentioned in the description . 
yea at the time it had the story line right . 
i wanted a very small tripod to carry with me when i bike ride . 
got it from local grocer ,  didn t want to wait for shipping . 
i used this for my num_extend old lab bailey who has since left me sadly in october of num_extend
would have liked it if it didn t rip so easily . 
i will never buy again or suggest anyone else buy it unless they redesign the product using different material . 
my cats are very picky and only like pure products :  chicken ,  salmon ,  with nothing in it . 
i bought this patio pet door for my sliding glass door  which is a newer door  . 
fortunately ,  amazon is great about accepting returns ,  although i almost never return anything ,  this time i did . 
i do not have a big head ,  really . 
for the price it is a great deal . 
one had a broken  split in two  button . 
but had to use other pillows to help prevent slippage . 
although it fits my phone perfectly and is quite sturdy . 
i can t tell what came off ,  or broke off . 
i must have received a defective in materials item . 
as usual i restarted the phone and it worked . 
after a couple of weeks ,  the stitching started to separate on mine . 
apparently this is necessary on certain vehicles and equipment . 
the rod and the patch holder are coated red . 
the angle of the actual speakers is just wrong . 
don t bump it . i would end up losing money to return this ,  so i m stuck with it . 
i returned them to amazon with no hassle . 
rent this game to test it before purchasing . it is very different from similar games  halo ,  splinter cell ,  etc  . 
i played this game a while back and i got frustrated with the controls . 
no reduction in puffiness for either eye . so i try the next day . 
so the net only goes up to almost touch the top . 
i think it might be a little better  not much ,  tho  without the fluffy filler material . 
i purchased this product to connect my logitech trackman marble fx trackball to my computer through a usb port . 
my kids would not touch the stuff . also ,  it is expensive for what you get . 
overall they are just a cube of salt with some added flavoring . 
i had save files for over fifty games on both of these ,  with lots of space to spare . 
i m meticulous when it comes to details and i followed them perfectly from the seachem website . 
or ,  keep your receipt when you buy this piece of junk ,  as you will most certainly be needing it . 
but within less than num_num minutes ,  i realized it was defective . 
ok ,  so i bought this cause i love fruits and i saw lots of good reviews about it . 
i bought two and both of them are on their way back to amazon . 
this game is great ,  when i can play it ,  but ea really didn t work out the kinks on this . 
but give it a chance if you re not that picky with rpgs . 
he tore in to it and all that was left were the remnants in the bottom of his cage . 
then you wonder how you ever liked it . 
she thought it tasted very good ,  but i didn t think the taste was anything special . 
either my sharpening skill is lacking  even though i do great with stones  or this is just substandard product . 
i might drink it if i run out some day . 
i am still shocked that she won t play with it . 
it s too long to fit into the hatch area of my kia soul . 
the case cracked and started to fall apart after just a couple of days of pocket carry . 
none of my num_num cats has shown any interest in this whatsoever . 
nothing like it states on the side of the box . 
unfortunately these cashews are so heavily seasoned that i got heartburn from them ,  and i hardly ever get heartburn . 
that way ,  you ll never know if an enemy or some other projectile would fly at you from above . 
most quests involve fetching something ,  bring it back ,  fetch something else ,  find someone ,  find something else . 
num_extend i paid for it was the biggest waste of money i have ever spent . 
used to fill time until the release of a game you been waiting on . 
after that initial run the toy has had minimal interest at best . 
needs to have a better disciption on it site . 
she burns a ton of calories and was interested in an energy bar with nutritional value . this bar was disappointing . 
if you re considering purchasing this game ,  by now you ve probably heard the term  linear  used to describe it . 
they had to put a weird plastic peice of junk around the battery . 
this is a good unit but beware it has trouble playing variable bitrate svcd s . 
i am very surprised there aren t more negatives on the taste . 
i have been one of this units biggest fans of this unit for about two years . 
i tried a couple of cups and didn t finish either . 
he shook it off and licked the rest but didn t seem to enjoy it . 
these socks have already ended up in the clothes to be donated . 
the peel turn like a white glup on my face and would not wash off . 
too bad ,  i was excited about zapping lots of pests ,  but this just isn t doing the trick . 
to be more exact ,  the rear speaker cover hole is on the wrong side . 
it may be a good conditioner and does smell good ,  but it does not help my curls . 
i have used it for the last num_num days . 
we weren t sure what to expect when we received this item . 
too strong for something i put on my face . 
might leave major bubbles every where and lint might get stuck in it . 
when i unplugged my phone from the wall charger , the battery died within num_num minutes . 
worked fine when first installed for several weeks ,  but burned out . 
the stability of the helicopter is something left to be desired . 
these shoes ran small ,  and i returned them . 
i bought this because the ingredients didn t have corn syrup . 
the red air pouch that you jump at to make the thing fly was completely closed up . 
first of all ,  num_num pair came cuffed and num_num didn t ,  all from the same order . 
spoke to sanyo and they advised taking it to a small appliance repair shop . 
without the lid ,  it isn t much use for shaking . 
i will never order anything from this seller . 
my last try was about num_num hours ,  and i can state unequivocally that there is nothing to get . 
wish i would have thought about weighing them before i sent them back . 
but when i tap in my eye area ,  that all changes . 
the product is well made ,  but does not work with iphone . 
i didn t feel comfortable carrying this thing around . 
play ghost recon ,  look through your rifle scope ,  and study the detail on your fellow soldiers . 
the roomba keeps the vinegar cleaner and the scooba cleaner . 
and it is ,  but that actually wasn t an issue for me . 
this game gets boring after an hour or two . 
i will never buy another linksys product as long as i live . 
i have several pearce grip extensions and really like them ,  but not this model . 
but within a few weeks several of those failed . 
i ve never seen anything remotely approaching this level of lens slop in any of them . 
i m not sure what size puzzles this was actually made for but it doesn t even hold half of ours . 
i think that the money could be better spent elsewhere . 
tried mixing them in a bowl with another brand of banana puffs and these still always get spit out . 
unlike others ,  i found the gumbo song to be one of the most annoying village themes ever . 
successfully targeting and unloading a bazooka shot at an enemy may as well be left to chance . 
i found this mix to have a strong bean taste to it . 
for some reason the screws keep coming loose and the hamper falls apart . 
 there ,  i said it !  hate me ,  fanboys !  here s why .  .  .  .  . on the + num_extend
i was just on a call of num_num minutes and my ear hurts . 
only thing you any easlily replace and at a cheaper price is the arm pieces with the spikes . 
it s just green globe of pixels that shoots a horribly aimed weapon in a dimly lit world . 
the needle only shifted if i spun the whole thing quickly . 
obvious too baggy for me . however ,  the material is good value for the money . 
i guess i assumed it would be bigger judging by the picture ,  i was wrong . 
but the game with that exception is a num_extend stars . 
i m suspicious of the packaging because i ve never seen it ,  and it does not match the picture shown . 
we don t have a tick problem in the yard ,  but mosquitoes are a nuisance . 
just be sure the size fits you as to width across the face . 
i didn t push very hard at all and ended up with worse looking skin than when i started . 
use a knife blade flat on a garlic clove and hit the blade with you hand . 
try one of them but forget this game . 
but isn t anything special and i wouldn t buy it in mass . 
at any rate ,  if you re a little overweight ,  and short ,  these are not the boots for you . 
also ,  from a function perspective ,  the design is a little off kilter . 
i can just pour the seed in through the spaces in the grate . 
i put the shirt on my dog when there is a forecast of thunder . 
i also didn t like the whole catching your monsters  livestock  in the caves . 
after a few specialists ,  i found a doctor that actually looked at my diet . 
even when i stayed completely still  very difficult when putting in the remaining rollers  they would still fall out . 
i put it against a usb  scope and watched the packets . 
i ordered one size up like many reviewers suggested . 
after the initial cooking you press the mixture down ,  to brown the bottom . 
the same thing happened with my recent pair . 
the string doesn t reel in and can barely hold the fish . 
that means i have to have num_num different razors ,  and that s a bit much . 
the story is once again amazing ,  but sadly carries all the depth the game has to offer . 
pretty bras ,  but their sizing is way off . 
this is the third one we have bought . 
first time order of these protectors and will not buy them again . 
this just doesn t clean the litter well enough ,  and it s so messy ,  it s just easier to do it manually . 
the external drive i connected to the usb port was  visible  to my network computers only occasionally . 
in addition ,  it picks up gravel and scratches the tank glass . 
this bottle did not work well for my dog . 
some people aren t wild about the tea tree oil scent but i found it invigorating and not overpowering . 
the walls are destructible ,  but the character models don t react correctly to their surroundings . 
sole got ruined from standing in a parking lot !  color came off after num_num wearings . 
just get all the info you can first ,  discuss it with your doctor ,  then try it . 
this toy has a circuit board ,  batteries ,  etc . 
other than that it will sit on your shelf ,  disappointing you everytime you look at it . 
i was very disappointed and ,  of course ,  returned it . 
i tried with another camera and two pdas . 
after buying num_num other eye masks from here ,  this seemed best in beginning . 
this game feels ,  plays and acts like beta software . 
it has the texture of paste and not even palatable .  .  . for us . 
didn t help with my acne ,  probably was just not the right match for my skin type . 
it will not let you double load ,  large capacity that is built in ,  no outside magazines to purchase . 
i actually threw it away since it wasn t worth returning . 
of all my taped it crimpled num_num and ate num_num  older tapes  during fast rewind . 
the top shouldn t be sold for that price and should be sold to small children . 
baked kettle chips ,  in a num_extend serving ,  up the fat to . 
if it doesn t have aroma it typically goes nowhere and is tasteless . 
oh dear ,  this was my worst buy of the year . 
the goo was really the main reason they wanted to try this product ,  but it didn t exist . 
i would not recommend this with wooden floors . 
definitely does not pick up cheerio s like the picture on the box implies . 
however ,  i did not receive the one that is described . 
i ,  again ,  feel the need to point out that this was intended for a much younger player . 
and kids and parents like the games for being fun and educational . 
i returned it today and after reading the other reviews ,  i decided not to get a new one . 
did not fir my phone and i forgot to send it back . 
on the third day ,  i noticed things taking a turn for the way worse . 
no idea how vanilla and caramel can go this horribly wrong . 
i got excellent test results with the asus driver  measured with the road runner speed test  . 
when i first put them on i loved the fit ,  they were light weight . 
this may be a positive for entertainment value ,  but not enough to significantly raise my overall rating . 
i questioned him about it and he said he forgot . 
sgp is fast becoming the company i don t go to for screen protectors . 
you will only find it here on amazon and for a cheaper price . 
i bought this to flavor greek yogurt ,  for which i need something that is both orange and sweet . 
i wouldn t pay more than fifty cents for one of these  if that  . 
when set up ,  the two units would be in separate rooms with a hallway between them . 
this is the second issue i ve had with otterbox purchases made on amazon . 
the replacement unit i got leaked worse than the first . 
you may retry the battle or reload from last saved point . 
the plastic which makes up this thing is embarrassed . 
extremely poor quality craftsmanship when you consider a four person place setting will run you $
maybe watch a move once a week and play a few cds now and then . 
i mean we are talking serious dry . this product is touted as quality and american . 
this is the only product i would advocate animal testing on . 
first use seemed to work well ,  but that was right behind taking prevacid . 
the texture of the sauce was off too . 
this is primarily a piece of status decoration rather than a practical ,  quality product . 
this product does exactly what it says it does . 
also ,  they did not make a clean cut . 
it s about time !  you had me worried there ! but then more problems arise . 
i am extremely pale and cannot tan even if i tried  which i don t; avid spf user  . 
i was very disappointed in this so called signal amplifier . 
num_num months seems to be the most you can expect . 
this was recently purchased for christmas to add to the senses play circuit . 
if you got three of them ,  set them up and walk away . 
believe it or not ,  this takes away for the adhesive properties of the bandage . 
i should of returned it but made modifications to make it fit but still not fun to use . 
the bumper was a little flimsy and didn t have the green color like i ordered . 
seriously ,  it s like there s another num_num extra layers of thickness made up of fish gunk . 
cannot say anything except this really did not work that well and got real hot . 
did not last very long and over time the vibration weakened . 
you have to destroy them with heat vision ,  freeze breath ,  or basic attacks over and over again . 
as for the ones in the rear of the trailer ,  i used four of these with a cap piece . 
went to snap it on and it broke . 
i bought this toy for my daughter for her birthday ,  she loves things like this . 
and to make it all worse ,  i have to pay the return shipping for these worthless batteries and charger . 
i m sure you d enjoy it . casual dbz fans :  rent it . 
however ,  sometimes it feels like there s too much detail . 
all you do in this game is flip your wii remote aroud and sonic moves forward . 
i watch what i eat now and try to eat simple and healthy . 
the basic product works well except for this fatal flaw . 
the double unit is huge compared to this cage . 
even if you are a huge lotr fan you should probably stay away from this game . 
i also found that if you are running on wet surfaces they tend to slip easily . 
i was so excited using it and noticed that the more i use it the more i breakout . 
it d be tolerable if only it weren t timed . 
in one mission you can kill like num_num alien things and you die num_num times . 
at first ,  the aldehydes reek havoc ,  then the jasmine gets cloying . 
so i started to read the reviews and found good and bad reviews ,  more of them good then bad . 
i have not tried it ,  but maybe they stick better to painted metal or plastics . 
it is ridiculous as to how few people there are and how many towns i plan on creating . 
if it hadn t been for that this tent would have been nearly useless . 
the atn unit didn t even work when it arrived . 
top power button is not lined up correctly ,  so you need to press really hard . 
the gratiae product line is no better or worse than any other skin care line . 
i used this product in my coffee and absolutely hated it . 
others before mentioned this same issue ,  so i know it s not just a fluke . 
and my wife has a good number of hours logged herself . 
whats the point of high wattage if you cant use the other half . 
awesomely heavy duty carry handle at the top of the pack . 
sometimes unplugging the router for a few seconds does the trick . 
i bout $ starter shorts at wal mart that are far better than these . 
these are just too short to be usable . 
very frustrating if you have a lot of people trying to use it for fondue . 
great puzzles but a lot of annoying false paths . 
at the sale price i feel like i got my monies worth . 
lo and behold ,  i have b+ type blood . 
after which i was relegated to watching the other online players . 
that was rather frustrating as these are expensive little toys . 
the really bad thing is that is wasn t even the adhesive that failed . 
called back ,  and again the transfers and an num_extend minute wait . 
since it makes quite a bit of noise as the mirror rotates their attention is even more attracted . 
the kitchenaid carafe is the worst . overall this cuisinart is in the league of the mr . 
it won t work in a week or maybe even two . 
luckily for me i was given it as a present from someone clearing out their attic . 
it is still drafty but better than nothing at all . 
this was the worst num_extend player that i ever had to buy . 
i wish our paths had never crossed . this machine deposits a lot of moisture into carpeting . 
several features that were supposed to be in the game at release are not even there at all . 
i ll have to switch to a brace that goes all the way around the wrist . 
somewhere there is an obscure incompatibility problem that rears its ugly head intermittently . 
then .  .  . they tried to convince me to go to dhl and use their account . 
i was so excited to use that ,  cause i love cotton candy . 
the string got messed up after the first time shooting it . 
different one for her crate and put this in her play pen . 
it has somewhat similar features as the oxo . 
when i ordered this popcorn ,  i was expecting a premium and organic popcorn with low sodium and low fat . 
i had tons of little red bumbs across my forehead and on my chin . 
the process itself was easy ,  not unlike my already established evening routine of cleaning face and applying cream . 
luckly i didn t pay too much for these . 
even bracelets have to be crammed in and a bulky necklace just would not fit . 
it s very cheaply made and the zipper fell off after a week . 
i m going to give the cuisinart model a try next time . 
i may open it up and try to rewire it but it kinda put a damper on that night . 
you must follow in the direction of the game . 
checked all wires individually and they all work . 
despite the trap being placed right outside of the kennel doors ,  it has only ever caught one flea . 
and of course ,  i m expected to pay the return shipping . 
somehow ,  it misses half the hairs ,  so you have to keep going over the same area many times . 
i expected more from a device with the belkin name . 
they at least are all the same size .  . disappointed .  .  . bill num_extend num_num num_extend
i only tried it on for num_num seconds then took it off and put on my old case . 
even new orthotics can t make unsupportive shoes feel terrific . 
opening the box i found the two jars inside a plastic bag . 
he has one of those round ball in a track toys that he loves . 
how do i find out what happened to it ?  . 
i can t even force them on . i m very disappointed . 
i currently now shower with water and a wash cloth . 
not a major flaw ,  it s minor ,  but it s an issue . 
so it may be alright for some cats . 
i also have to ashamedly admit ,  i like the sassy fairy . 
so ,  now i have the dual strike and a means to configure it to my games . 
i couldn t wait to shampoo this junk out of my hair . 
there are certain things you shouldn t be cheap with; lesson learned . 
i would inflate it and a couple hours later it would be flat num_extend
after i restored it ,  i tried to play music and one of the speakers doesn t work . 
this is one of the worst games i have ever played ,  maybe the worst . 
maybe it s just me ,  everyone is different ,  but i m off to try a different product . 
its dark ,  ugly ,  and what it does is under expose images by more than a stop . 
when i tried to do a video capture it froze up . i would not recommend this to anyone . 
it s downright embarrassing to hear our son use this thing around company . 
i got this as a step up from a synthetic blend brush . 
for my money ,  i will stick to the standard tank setup . 
i will be attempting the battery removal technique . 
it left my hair feeling dry and like it was lacking something . 
it arrived ahead of the scheduled time by over a week . 
the one that worked for me is found on amazon as well :  autologix num_num ortho lumbar wedge seat cushion . 
it s about num_extend tall and a little over a foot long . 
get a good warrenty and num_num hrs later you are up and runnnig again . 
these are very cheap and do not appear to have any sterling silver in them what so ever . 
however ,  it stands tall above the dock and a  looks ridiculous and b  is not secure at all . 
you could smell it when you opened it . 
i don t think a young child would be able to remove them from this insert . 
but i would not recommend these screen protectors to anyone . 
cats entering shelters encounter stressors that may make them more susceptible to fhv reactivation or infection . 
we re on our third leapster ,  which is now broken . 
the first time i used this ,  it worked perfectly . 
i will be replacing this with something that has metal egg cups . 
my two cats do not play with this unless i sit with them and push the ball around . 
however ,  it does have good ideas .  .  . just not developed enough . 
the inner num_extend feet are wound so tightly they are permanently distorted . 
they should of named it diet deus ex . 
the battles ,  while simple to learn and get into ,  feature opponents that are way too easy to beat . 
there s nothing to do that s the least bit creative . 
this double chai spice has a strange chemical flavor . 
this is the only one i can t get clean with any effort . the strainer lid is really handy . 
this is the expansion reservoir for the drinkwell fountain . it hooks in and works fine . 
it scratches really easily so now i have these horrible white scratches all over it . 
the top and bottom didn t seat correctly ,  they kept falling into each other . 
purchased this product it was an ok alternative to cheese sauce . 
certainly not as it turned out to be .  .  . nothing but very bland mush . 
unfortunately ,  it is what causes the crimpers to be virtually useless . 
good idea to hide the scoop ,  stronger plastic is needed to be more durable . 
what in the world happened !  ?  ?  ! this title is utterly useless . 
packing mine back up for returning .  .  . doesn t work as advertised . 
they are pure honey with some nuts floating around in them . 
if your camera has this problem and you haven t yet posted to this site let us hear from you . 
the bottom is warped  has been since brand new  and it rocks like a seasaw when trying to work . 
you will be doing alot of readjusting while using this particular product . would not recommend . 
i finally got the main attachment on and turned on the trimmer . 
purchased a set of these wipers for my wife s rav num_num march of num_extend
i bought nba live and was very upset with everthing but the graphics . 
i must confess upfront i am not a nutritional nut when it comes to cereal . 
however ,  i feel that i should have a fair chance of fighting against any enemy in any game . 
i have no clue where all these glowing reviews come from . 
all of these symptoms manifest within num_num hours . 
this game is way overrated and way overpriced . 
that condemns me to buying a new cm . 
this game is flawed in so many areas i can t think of anything good about this game . 
otherwise this game is a weekend rental at best . 
a clip brok off within the first week i had it on . 
i read a review that was critical of this product ,  but thought that the reviewer was just a complainer . 
its length is perfect ,  but its width is absurd . 
i had to turn on the fan to get the strong smell to dissipate . 
awful smell and does nothing to the skin . 
you get what you pay for ,  but it is worthless . 
it s so sheer that you might as well be wearing nothing . 
i cannot believe i wasted my time on this game ,  only to hope that it would be better . 
switched back to the duracell version and they work fine ,  so i m sticking with them for my application . 
same areas are used in different locations with at least one battle in each area . 
i d been using the sweet almond mint wen for about a month prior to this purchase . 
convenience store coffee on the side of the highway is gourmet compared to this . 
now it leaks all over the counter . it worked ok at first . 
came home one day and the purifiers motor had burned out . 
then the knob that was suppose to turn on the whirlpool wouldn t work . 
i ve also found that there is very little strategy required . 
i hope you look into this matter and make certain it does not happen to others . 
i live about num_num miles away from nyc and use ota broadcast . 
these ,  as other similar adapters ,  seem to be made to fail in no less than an hour . 
after setting it up ,  we poured coffee into the grinder ,  and it ground away . 
i have had this item for more than a year . 
it seems like this product is good for most ,  but it does irritate some people . 
it took almost num_num hours for it to get hot . 
if you want a fruity beverage that tastes a lot like candy ,  go ahead and try switch . 
worked for a week and then it stopped working . 
was a gift for my husband as his old portable tape player he has had for num_num yrs . 
when will the manufacturers stop the so called  organic  label that they are really substituting . 
the thermometer was completely shattered ,  beyond use or repair . 
if i knew this was made in china i would have purchased a lesser cost case elsewhere . 
i purchased the num_extend liter kettle to accompany my num_extend liter coffee press . 
this had to come from factory and how could they not see it !  !  !  . 
only num_num calories but i wish they added more calories if it meant this would be tastier . 
the zen tries to imitate the ipod and fails miserably . 
i also have the dlink num_extend of the bunch . 
i had high hopes for this product ,  but was very disappointed . 
i received this product and thought it was great for the num_extend week . 
one serving is num_num drops ,  and a big mug for me is like num_num drops . 
if you misplace or lose the glove your probably gonna burn your fingers . 
use pay pal or google to purchase safely . 
i bought this camera ,  it would turn off by itself sometimes . 
if i could have give it negative stars i would have . 
personally ,  i d just get it from home depot . 
it constantly seizes and freezes ,  forcing you to reboot your whole system each time so saving often is key . 
makes my hair sticky and my curling iron gets stuck in my hair . 
lint also gets in but some scotch tape solves that . 
this pot is very heavy ,  takes a lot of effort to lift  especially with a sore shoulder  . 
other pellets haveproved to be much more accurate . 
the label should say  fisher price  . anyways ,  these were supposed to be a gift . 
this is so easy for the dogs to get off . 
i hate myself for spending the retail $ on its release to purchase this abomination of a game . 
the drink itself was not refreshing and had a gritty feel to it . 
he would not get adequate exercise in this cage . 
the product will work if you clean it . 
my wife made these this morning and i guess i m not from the old country . 
you get arrested for animal cruelty ,  and put in prison . 
they apparently can and do put everything imaginable into their products . 
this game is fun if you and your friend want to play pokemon with better graphics . 
one of the worst kitchen purchases i ever made . 
the primary objective of the game is to collect more stars than the other players . 
i certainly read the somewhat mixed reviews that spoke of the focusing motor failing relatively quickly . 
he managed to break it in num_num minutes . 
i believe it is too hard or maybe they don t like the size or shape . 
however ,  also similar to the prince of persia ,  your fightin  is not always up to par . 
i m sure these had gone bad in the heat . 
i ve let my two girls try it and they didn t like it either . 
i guess you have to use the flip the meatloaf out of the pan method . 
i really like  green  products and use quite a few of them . 
just go to the vet and get a prescription for the pills . 
mom ended up developing a sore from these covers which were supposed to make things better . 
the consistency of this item is not good at all . 
useless !  liquid goes right through the blue plastic and the white lining doesn t hold any liquid at all . 
horrible lol it smelled like it was expired . 
it s not just about adding halls and doors . 
we will probably never know exactly what caused his illness ,  but we have a sneaking suspicion . 
so why was this not mentioned at all ?  that ,  in a nutshell ,  is the question . 
am very bummed .  . and had previously read negative lodge review but purchased anyway . 
i could not get the older screen protector again . 
it will suite some purposes but again , it is very low flight thing . 
i hung in there until the horrible object was completely dissolved . 
the oxo steel cheese plane is a terrible product . 
but for $ it really should have a slow cook and steaming function . 
i m lucky if i can get it to play at all ,  much less be clear . 
but the thermometer gives four different readings in two minutes . 
this  tactical  scope in no way can called a num_extend at all . 
it s just not worth sending it back ,  even if i could . 
she was only num_num months when i bought it with half her teeth missing and still destroyed it . 
im either going to throw it away or give it away . 
this cream made my skin flake off and the fragrance seemed unnecessary and gave me a headache . 
in my car ,  the radio antenna is on the roof in the rear of the vehicle . 
i guess you get what you pay for . 
but adding an audio pod made the biggest difference in terms of quality . 
even as a fetch tow she only gives it minimal attention . 
i do think the product probably works ,  but i didn t have fleas before they came so i can t say . 
the liner is so soft and mushy that if you sharpen the point will be gone instantly . 
if you want to pursue it ,  do so under the advisement of someone you trust for your healthcare . 
if i touch it now ,  my hands turn black so i hardly ever use it . 
didn t work outside either ,  until you put it in full sunlight . 
i really like dr graf the best which really showed a big improvement on my skin . 
the smell did not go away with several uses . 
each serving size  approximately num_num pieces  is equivalent to num_num calories . 
but this was a disappointing purchase and i would not recommend these socks to anyone . six pairs of socks . 
there is no chalenge ,  and there is almost no customization in the game . 
i really wanted to like this game ,  but ended up returning it after a few days of gameplay . 
my cord may just be too flexible or rubbery for it . 
what will irritate you is how the game feels . 
i purchased this to alleviate my spd pain and back spasms . 
i have no idea why the one blade is smaller . 
the fabric wrap is entirely missing with this doll ,  does not come at num_extend
they get holes and leak litter when i remove them . 
i won t buy these again ,  and i hope others won t either . 
very very frustrating and i m looking for a good alternative . 
apparently this fridge sticking business is difficult for all timer manufacturers to master according to the other reviews . 
it did nothing for my dark circles either . 
i tried this as something new instead of a wallet for travel . 
they are banking on the fact that most users will not mix dough regularly enough to stress the mechanism . 
tried to contact for return but never heard back . 
after playing this crappy game ,  i just wanted to play the original . 
the now two year old problem of constantly dropping wan connection is still prevalent . 
there are two other sunflower seeds with flavor that i highly recommend :  bigs and jim beam . 
this game is terrible ,  and it is nothing like max payne . 
i keep them in a little wire bin in my junk drawer ,  and never have to hunt . 
it is not a safe ,  reliable method of canning . 
i get more action out of a zynga game . 
my son had a great time with it on his birthday . 
just wanted a basic sling ,  this had too many adjustments . 
many of palm s advertised web clippings no longer work for similar reasons . 
i will not purchase again ,  nor do i recommend it . 
thanks to amazon for having such a great return policy ,  and extending it as we all need . 
just like in real life ,  in my virtual life ,  i need some alone time . 
looking at both sides of the blade ,  i can see obvious flaws ,  which looks like poor cutting num_extend
this is very thin ,  covers poorly and results in a flat ,  dull ,  washed out finish . 
i don t even want to give them to my friends ,  they just aren t good at all . 
i purchased several haba biofino items as well and there is just no comparison . 
i extended the legs just once and the would not go back in and stay in . 
i reviewed a skin cream called just carrots and i love the aroma but other reviewers didn t . 
one mouse needs num_num inches to live without illness . 
i have posted many reviews on amazon and mostly good num_num star reviews at that . 
i was billed for each one and when they sent the order it was lost . 
one has great big chunks of grit in it to really remove the dirt . 
getting your phone out of a case shouldn t require outside tools . 
when i took it off i had a red mark under my arm . 
i did not have much success with this product . 
i tried this machine for a month and it really hurt my back . 
this is a fighting game however so bad plot is extremely forgivable . 
the tail was all black instead of mixed with brown . 
the opening in this trap is very small and bigger mouse can t get in . 
it s just too bad there weren t free content updates to the game . 
one thing that sort of made up for the uncomfortable clip on mechanism was the really cushy foam speaker . 
we have to use a screw driver to cajole the catch into position . 
i feel this is good for a kitten ,  not a full grown cat . 
the smell is ok ,  but it s very strong . 
the usb cord stopped working within a few hours of use . 
for gamecube i had to buy memory cards ,  a keyboard ,  an ethernet adapter ,  then i bought an xbox . 
i can also contact customer service to facilitate the purchase to make sure that they are cotton . 
i filled up tires with a portable compressor with digital gauge ,  that shuts off at designated psi . 
you will probably fight num_num bosses in the game . 
the mute button worked fine and the volume buttons had a good feel . 
now i am stuck with a bunch of boxes of it . 
granted tastes differ and you might get by with less shots . 
i use these stem thermometers extensively cooking sap for maple syrup . 
you re going to do battle with the dragon ,  my friend . 
i m going with a wood kitchen for the next version and sticking this one outside in the playhouse . 
i have gerd and normally take num_extend brand ,  which really helps me . 
it also tends to leave a residue in the dish washer . 
the connections are junk ,  they leaked from the first time i connected them . 
i don t really have colon issues but wanted to use this in conjunction with the garcinia . 
the squad that you  control  is a laughable joke . 
treats were inserted into the big blue everlasting ball ,  properly . 
it might have been a good game ,  but i never found out because the key failed . 
it will not cut the cats hair at all . 
then num_num more for them to promise to send one . 
we are talking here about a dense ,  tough loaf . 
the keyboard would show up if you plugged it in after the laptop was booted up . 
this item does not fit nicely around the playpen . 
i do not recommend this product if you want something reliable . 
i used this for a short while and was very pleased with the taste . 
just beware if you plan on ever using on windows num_extend
the elastic strings on the outside of the bag are more annoying than useful . 
one day ,  when it s really bad weather ,  and i m bored ,  i will try it again . 
time will tell how long this thing holds up . 
one thing led to another and i thought i d order these for fun . 
i don t mean a conditioning residue ,  like you might feel on other products or conditioners ,  either . 
i would not recommend these or purchase them again . 
i personally think ea s lock on football is going to turn a lot of people off the game . 
sure wish we could get back to producing american made products that were quality . 
i m not sure i can send it back ,  but if i can ,  it s going back ,  at the seller s expense . 
however ,  some people had some gripes about the way the text appeared on the screen . 
it s definitely not appropriate for playing tug or for a dog that likes to chew . 
if you insist on this coffee maker ,  don t ever leave it alone on the stay warm setting !   . 
the only practical use i ve found for this is to help stretch my expensive aveda products . 
a handful of planets with an area mapped out on each . 
i tried it twice couldnt get one spot on my leg completely smooth and now im over it . 
buy the num_num leapfrog movies instead ,  those are great . 
they may work for you but i tried the socks ,  they barely do anything and now i m using correcttoes . 
i would give anything not to watch those grating cutscenes again and again . 
i still think it s cute ,  so i m saving it for a future baby . 
i m on the fence about whether to try the regular coola sunscreen . 
it was the wireless part that was a pain to deal with . 
i have purchased these cases before and loved them . 
unfortunately it s connected to this garbage kensington mouse . 
that really defeats the purpose of a retractable cable . i d say you can purchase this for the time being . 
i swear progreammers are more interested in pretty than contenet . 
oh ,  i nearly forgot ,  what also annoyed me about  halo  was the ending . 
it makes up to num_num cups of rice from num_num cups . 
very lame . if you want to play this game ,  rent it ,  don t waste your money buying it . 
unfortunately this one just didn t cut it for us . 
it could have been interesting ,  but it getting through any portion of the game was torture . 
you hold down your left mouse button and watch a circle change color . different colors equal different cutscenes . 
getting a new usb wheel for xmas ,  i hope . 
it was like slicing through butter after using the oxo . 
it turns out to have been a mistake . 
my num_num week old puppy chewed this up in just a few days . 
it was alright ,  but no better than the lipton tea packets . 
i give it a two because it does blow . i wanted a  quiet  fan for my bedroom . 
i bought this along with a couple of other rca cables and a splitter . 
now many galaxies players are canceling their accounts and migrating to other online games . 
it s cheap poorly made crap from china and not even worth the one star on this review . 
i have to watch tv to fall asleep ,  so . 
maybe i just have clean water to begin with ,  but i sure couldn t taste the difference . 
i also did not like the gel inserts . 
why waste your money ?  get a crosman or daisy from amazon ,  but don t purchase a beeman . 
it s a blend of organic ginger ,  organic holy basil and leaf s from :  vana ,  krishna and rama .

skip this ,  i ve bought them all ,  this just isn t as good as other options . 
they tasted like they were made from old ,  burned oil .

i received this router through amazon . com s vine program . 
although they do work fine on iphone ,  droid ,  etc .  ,  they offer little to no protection from the elements . 
it also has maltilol which could affect digestion .

i purchased a maxtor num_num gb external hard drive in april of last year . 
there s really no variety of enemies ,  overall this game is only worth a dollar . 
it s ultra clear that this pad was the culprit . 
the software is quite good  no problems at all  . 
what a mistake !  something about the formula turned me into a beast over a couple weeks . 
i do not have faith that these cheap ,  crummy tweezers would hold up long enough to remove a splinter .

heaven forbid if the manufacturers change the footprint ,  and that could easily happen . 
these smell delicious and aren t greasy ,  but they aren t effective in taking makeup off .

heed my word ,  and perhaps you will save num_num hours of you life . 
its internal router is completely unable to communicate with a number of nics :  . 
it is cut to fold into quarters and barely sits level on a table . 
this is okay for sporadic use ,  but it is a pain use for long periods . 
i bought this as a replacement for my husband s iphone . 
either way it slowed down my internet response to time the point it didn t matter . 
luckily i had bought it at costco and was able to return it . 
i have played quite a few games of this type and don t think i am overly squimish . 
the bass is too strong and is not adjustable .

i took it anyways ,  paying the price later when it rained heavily . 
the num_num mp doesn t give enough picture quality . 
i use a lot of clubman products but this one has left my home never to return .

one last thing ,  the picture for this item looks like the original product i purchased several years ago . 
i picked this dog food knowing it has predominantly corn in it .

some even have you typing in little codes found on your cd case . 
it s not quiet ,  it doesn t actually work on a num_num gallon tank ,  and it s mucky and dirty . 
also the bra had some weird pointy pads on the nipples . 
sure ,  i got my money back ,  but did not appreciate the hassle . 
chunks were missing after the first five minutes . 
due to the price we felt it would cost more to send it back to the vendor . 
the  connected  light wouldn t come on ,  nor could i even use a num_extend connection . 
you try to get out the door but your moronic mates are just standing there blocking the door . 
it is labeled as  large  and having a capacity of num_num liters . 
but ,  why soleus ? the tilting mechanism is a little bit awkward . 
more on this later when i figure it all out . 
i wish it was a little more well made as my little boy loves this !   :   . 
i ve played dq games before and many other rpg s . 
unfortunately i bougth two and i received just onewhere is the other ?  . 
the website does not specify which models this speedloader does and does not fit . 
i used it on my backpack ,  followed the instructions to a letter ,  and it doesn t work . 
it s incredible how much a couple of days can sober one s opinion of this lackluster game . 
straight out of the box ,  the af did not work . 
when i received this case in the mail i thought i would use it ,  but i don t . 
i like apples of all kinds ,  and i also like natural or organic foods . 
i do however think if your considering purchasing ,  you should be aware of the issue . 
i was really close to just getting it from gamefly but i love mario party so i bought it . 
this pair arrived with a terrible scratching noise anytime the cord is moved . 
used this regularly for about num_num weeks on my puppy . 
dont waste your money !  total bust !  it will be donated soon . 
i am returning them today and will be more careful about getting the num_extend instead . 
caution :  i also ordered a blue light ,  which was so dim it could hardly be seen . 
yeah it works for bb s ,  maybe light load num_extend but don t use for num_extend pellets .  .  . not heavy enough . 
simply put ,  every game exclusively for the xbox num_num isn t finished . 
not the best game but not that bad . 
the last ff game i d played was ff vii . 
just as a reviewer noted ,  these pods had little perfume to them while they looked intact . 
my daughter didn t really like this item at all . 
i am not even going to try it . 
while it seems impossible ,  she got a hole in it the first day . 
the instructions on the back of this product were obviously a struggle to write in english and not clear . 
it has a very bitter ,  acidic taste to it . 
so ,  after seven months ,  a useless phone and no recourse . 
make sure your video card can support the game before making the purchase . 
i m not sure why exactly everyone raves about these brushes . 
i bought this camera for the trip to europe . 
 radio programming data is available from places like publicradiofan and radiotime . 
sure wish i could trust it to pop me some unpolluted corn .  .  . more toxic products from china . 
guess what ,  another manufacturing defect making it impossible to finish . 
no way !  it was worth a try but certainly didn t help the situation at all . 
it helps water proof your parts as well . 
after tax and shipping ,  the max i would pay for this istem is $
i will caulk every area i can and hope that it stays together . very disappointed . 
take a pair of needle nose and carefully adjust hem if needed . 
the foam is much easier to apply as well . 
i saved easily $ buying it at target compared to the regular retail of $
it seems to be about either desperate ,  or greedy companies trying to capture customers into their markets forever . 
it permeates it and makes the food inedible . 
giving it num_num star because it is non functional ,  as far as i can tell . 
it looked like i had triangles on my chest . 
what i got as one where the packaging had been opened and taped back shut with packing tape . 
however ,  the support page is not to be found . 
always clean the gasket and operating valve after use . 
this product deserves about a negative num_num star designation . 
any unburned calories will turn into fat and increase weight . 
we will go back to jack`s the next time . 
it never really lengthened or thickened my lashes . 
i could see the holes in my target through my rifle scope much better than through this scope . 
conclusion ?  num_num stars for concept ,  num_num star for execution ,  num_num stars for customer service . 
as recommended by amazon ,  i purchased this diffuser when i purchased num_extend featherweight luxe num_extend ion generator hair dryer . 
does work at all with my dogs or even one dog . 
buy anything else instead of this piece of garbage . 
i looked forward to a delightful experience when i bought the bionic in december num_extend
we didn t care for this product in our home . 
you may have seen a old hickory knife or two sometime in your parents kitchen growing up . 
i started being super careful with the second one . 
i purchased this lead and the small harness from puppia . 
the construction of the case was not as sturdy as other bodyglove cases that i have used . 
it had such good potential but the people did not put enough good games . 
the cutouts ,  on the left side of the phone ,  were quite a bit off . 
i see that most reviews are postive so it most likely just something that does not appeal to me . 
i feel like the masks are a tremendous waste of product ,  time and packaging . 
yeah ,  i know ,  as if a boss doesn t know on how to open a freakin  door . 
i placed it in the fridge ,  and let it get a nice chill . 
clearly ,  my body does not like this one . 
i wish i could have recorded the messages ,  or better yet ,  recorded my birds talking !  . 
i can choke it down so its edible and price wasn t bad but not buying this product again . 
otherwise there is nothing functionally wrong with the curler . 
my num_num year old even said they looked weird . 
i don t think this vest can fit any kids over num_num lb . 
even the naked eyelash look was better than the messy look from this mascara . 
many folks say that all optical cables are the same ,  not true . 
and the sound even comes on from time to time while charging . 
this may work for someone with normal to dry skin or someone with skin that s not sensetive . 
we have both this one and the toy story shake n go track . 
i own a num_num inch plasma ,  as well as a few lcds . 
now i get to spend hours on the support lines with wd . 
so no ,  i do not recommend this gizmo . 
i bought it to protect my brand new num_extend plasma . 
squirrels are amazing acrobats ,  especially when there s good food to be had . 
i ve posted a photo to prove what i m saying . 
bwuahahahha ,  oh man ,  they are horrid to look at . 
it doesn t dry out your lips and it isn t super wet . 
i played this game at my friend s house recently and i was very unimpressed . 
before i bought this item i kept looking around for a good case . 
i have long ,  naturally curly hair that i can t wash every day ,  so i ve been trying out dry shampoos . 
when i tried to play audio cds  authentic ones  ,  the cds kept getting frozen at different stages . 
clicking on the control panel did not work . 
that is ,  the few reviewers who criticized the  whiners  did not experience them . 
i bought a few volume enhancing shampoos to compare . 
i have chronic sinusitis and even when i can breath through my nose i have no sense of smell . 
over num_num years old !   ,  but did not find any . 
my daughter wanted a wooden case for her iphone . 
the fabric it is made out of is just too loose and flimsy . 
the fabric was stiff and itchy and the straps were very thin . 
however ,  i noticed a few clumps which would not readily dissolve . 
the first viking reader i received had a defective eject button . 
plus ,  there wasn t much support ,  my feet hurt after a while walking . 
putting it on the phone didn t help straighten it out either . 
i absolutely love love love plan toys and have bought lots of them for my daughter . 
with a normal flat tire you have to stop your ride and replace a tire . 
my wife mounted this to her dash and i broke it trying to remove it . 
we stopped using it later and the remaining red raised patches she had also diappeared . 
all in all a very unpleasant and time consuming experience . 
i bought this to replace a cord i was using to practice my guitar . 
my puppy was teething so i decided to freeze this toy . 
the offline practice mode takes no less than num_num minutes to load up . 
there is no way the contact points on the batteries can work with any other battery charger . 
the design is boring . i would strongly recommend against buying this yoyo . 
i used it for three days ,  and after it becames dirty and i could never use it again . 
when they find that too challenging ,  they ignore it . 
by no means am i saying that this product simply doesn t work; it just didn t work for me . 
the inclusion of more road courses adds great variety . 
the elastic was so thin it was likely to break with normal wear . 
if they work for you they re worth it . 
so you can dock another star or two for that . 
you need so much ala because it is a racemate formula . 
i am surprised by all the good reviews on this product . 
now i have to find a different one for replacement . 
they connect very easily on my droid x and my samsung laptop . 
great little design and clear voice sending and receiving . 
i ve worn rockport brand for many years and i ve purchased more than a few pair of these very shoes . 
if there is no newer firmware you have to stick to older media . 
i bought this product to lighten my freckles and even out my skin tone . 
this is just a deal i can t pass . 
the banana ,  for no good reason ,  costs significantly more than my favorite flavors . 
however ,  when i connected this device ,  our internet connection completely stopped . i tried it a couple of times . 
would have to be hammered on ,  then pried off . 
i ordered this bra hoping to find something i could wear at home and feel as if i wasn t . 
as the card fills up with pictures it becomes slow to store the picture you just took . 
the hammer of wrath for the cleric class ,  it stays around much shorter than before . 
the case should have came with instructions on how to put the case on . 
the only downside is that it does nothing for rust while clean ride does a very little bit . 
my mastiff had this destroyed in less than num_num minute after it was taken out of package . 
they never reacted this way with their previous toothpaste . 
i had to fish the wrong objects out of the top . 
this pillow is no more comfortable to sit on than a num_num dollar pillow from walmart . 
neither of these seller names have any history posted on   .  .  .   . 
since then i couldn t have it working without problems . 
i tried them on minutes after they were delivered and i couldn t get my foot into them . 
and it seems a bit small on me  lrg size  . 
the reality is that if the reviews are not credible then amazon s vine program will not succeed . 
i know for sure i won t be using it again . 
the stickiness was mostly gone the next morning ,  as was the unpleasant smell . 
it goes on incredibly thin ,  and doesn t layer well ,  so you never get a decent coat of it on . 
these were unbelievably uncomfortable when i first tried them on . 
dont know whats in the plastic we shouldnt ingest . these plates are better . 
i even went up a size as most comments stated . 
it s bright ,  it s big ,  it s quickly assembled and quickly broken . 
there was no difference in the appearance of my toilet than if i hadn t done anything at all . 
i just discovered that stone ground chocolate is supposed to be gritty . 
none of these will hold a samsung epic . 
these are junk !  i used this type of water fountain num_num years ago . 
much thinner than other sets i have purchased . 
not real useful if items can fall out as you are putting the bag on or taking it off . 
i was happy to give this a shot in hopes that my replacement lens would produce better images . 
the kids were ecstatic ,  and had a lot of fun putting it together in their own way . 
a thicker carpet with more coverage would be better if they are trying to maintain balance . 
also ,  when i washed my hand after application ,  the slick gel feel did not even wash off with soap . 
after trying it on ,  it lasted about num_num minutes before it started to crease . 
but for me ,  these tiny little pearls gave me very tiny little results . 
the boss battles are also so easy a blind gamer could do it no sweat . 
you can t hear anything; other people can t hear you . 
called amazon for a refund based on the fact that nowhere does it say the product contains anise . 
after all the hype about how great the game was ,  the reality was such a disappointment . 
all of the ones on the shelf were also noisy . 
i ve tried num_num flavors of these lozenges and i can t stand any of them . 
i know brewer s yeast is eaten but i am not sure for external purposes . 
there is no way to calibrate the heater . 
it is just another way for yakima to capitalize on what they like to include in their initial products . 
i just wanted to make it clear how upset i was with this purchase . 
then you would have unopened tubes to save for another application a few months later . 
i kept the holster because it fits my gun . 
and the other was fatally wounded after about a week . 
you can charge both the battery and the iphone with the included micro usb cable . 
i guess they d be ok for gardening as they will wash off easily . 
i have worn my current size for num_extend years . 
we were supposed to leave today but delayed a day waiting for this and other items . 
stick with the squeeze bottle neti pots for sure !  . 
i suppose i can still use it as some kind of water tight container . 
i have kids who stash my remotes in places that take me a while to find . 
the big issue with battery is the back case won t stay on . 
if your handhas any wetness on it from just having loaded the dishes ,  the pacs would clumptogether . 
i lowered rating because it is like a month now and my teeth are not super white . 
this product did not work at all ,  i tried another brand and i saw results . 
i see no difference ,  but that doesn t mean it wont work on other cats . 
laying down while playing this part is almost impossible . 
within the week there where multiple large chips flaking off . 
overall ,  i played the game for about num_num minutes before i got bored and frustrated . 
but there are so many things wrong with this game . the graphics are cel shaded and look weak . 
he has runny eye and this didn t help . 
he is a liar and does not make good on his promises . 
it s always disappointing when something doesn t live up to its hype . 
i didn t ,  but it s a truth of physics . 
i bought this around christmas time and just set it up not long ago . 
until i saw that her foot was impaled by one of the cheaply constructed vertical metal bars . 
as others have said ,  this ramp has some sharp edges . 
pain in the tush doing this constantly over and over . 
the dispenser might stay together ,  but it is a tenuous hold at best . 
one of my ferrets chewed a hole on one of the ends within num_num minutes . 
well it certainly is unique .  . it tastes bad hot or cold . 
the majority of the battles are fairly boring and have nothing to set them apart . the graphics are fairly terrible . 
i had high hope for this flat iron . 
couldn t get past the fit to evaluate anything about the bluetooth itself . 
but sadly ,  it was just not as described . 
it has yet to arrive . their customer service apologized but the warehouse was closed from december num_extend to the num_extend
i guess the latex is so soft if collapses so the lense approaches the eyes too close . 
i then after contacting the seller through amazon i waited num_num days for a response with no success . 
there are just so many things are wrong with this bike . 
i bought this for travel juice for my razr . 
i recommend avoiding drive from this company until their engineers take a short course on basic grounding theory . 
i would rather flush my money down the toilet then buy from this company again . 
then minutes ,  then froze up for good . i should of know that a microsoft product wouldnt last long . 
while uvb rays are behind the redness of sunburn ,  uva rays damage the skin s dna at a deeper layer . 
do not purchase any cream with alcohol as an ingredient if you have dry sensitive skin or eczema . 
i know this product says it has over num_extend of caffeine in it . 
i was careful placing it in but the materials used for the case seem really cheap . 
just makes me further feels as if it was not having any effect on my hair at all . 
you can clearly smell the vanilla when you open the bag but . 
probably need to buy the next larger size . 
nothing works this printer is not worth purchasing for num_num months of use . 
my shih tzu doesn t care for them at all . 
 ?  ?  ? that s their opinion without knowing exactly what plastic is used who knows if it is safe . 
please investigate on your own ! snazaroo has responded on their website ,  but i remain a bit skeptical . 
it s decent but there s whey better out there to choose from . 
we have over ten different feeders hanging around the yard ,  and it s obvious which ones are preferred . 
awful ,  awful sound !  and it is horrendously loud !  . 
sweet ! then i tried to set it with my router . 
i titrated to try to find the right dose but i never could . 
i ve cleaned the tub with alcohol and carefully pushed each suction cup in . 
a short cord from usb port to the actual mouse itself makes navigating a computer screen near impossible . 
if i didnt wait so long to use this i would return it ,  its going in the trash . 
i will update my post when i have used the shift longer . conclusion :  good bag for what you pay . 
its me chasing turds around the grass ,  for num_num minutes . 
the only thing it does is make the phone bulkier and a little bit less slippery . 
i somehow got it down and did it again ,  totaling only about half a scoop !  it was disgusting . 
i was able to get by this one puzzle referring to a walkthrough  kind of ruins it for me  . 
the xl you get in the store and the xl online are two different sizes . 
the scent is great ,  but it burned and stung so bad on my freshly shaved pits . 
i think before the connectors are plated they probably fit well . 
the intro scene was well done and signalled that codemasters were capable programmers . 
i wasn t plugging and unplugging it; it simply sat in my car s socket  . 
i ve used orville reddenbacker kernals ,  which i think is a very good quality . 
maybe this game doesn t let you shoot as far as you can see ,  i don t know . 
it is really small . another problem is that it doesn t bounce much at all and is very difficult to spin . 
let s face it ,  squeaky toys are not much fun once they stop squeaking . 
essentially the valve is a hole in the tube and the slime did attempt to close this hole . 
kids that grew up with pokemon and liked it . 
graphics are about on the same level of asherons num_extend
i had a clogged drain in my children s bathroom . 
then you decide if it is appropriate for your intended num_extend
the other one was the olay one which has an spf of num_num  half of this one  . 
despite the removed gunk ,  the pores on my nose looked the same an hour later  if that  . 
i provide you her review ,  verbatim ,  below : daughter :  mom !  something is wrong with this chocolate milk . me :  why ? daughter :  oh ,  mom . 
now there is no light at all so i m having one last try to see if it will charge . 
after washing with this shampoo i have to lather nioxin to wash off the revita residue on my hair . 
i have a dockers braided leather belt size num_num and it fits fine . 
if used a little sparingly these sequences could break the game up nicely . 
unfortunately ,  this brace has a thick seam right under the heel . 
these appear to work very well but you can just lift them right out of the wine bottle . 
do fall for this scam of dented cans . this was replacement order and cans dented rip off dont be fooled . 
we purchased three of these helicopters and initially was very pleased . 
works in most situations ,  but can be really finicky ,  especially in paris for some reason . 
the ambient room temperature doesn t usually drop below num_num degrees . 
at this price ,  the radio really should have had sync . 
that is where this bag has proliferated problems and num_extend
sure would be nice if the description was corrected . 
took some trial and error ,  but finally got it connected to my plasma tv . 
i thought this would be amazing but no . 
and if you want to play a good zelda game ,  play ocarina of time . 
first the way it hangs on your neck is very uncomfortable the design is not well thought out . 
i also started sneezing so i told him we re both in agreement with this one . 
this is a nice timer ,  but it only has forward time set . 
this lasted a little longer than other toys but only by an hour . 
i ve been using some polk audio num_extend  driven by a sonos connect : amp  for about two years . 
the sssact does repeating sprays within a second s pause ,  but i ve never seen the contech unit do that . 
why the developers chose to use the names  jack  and  rose  from the movie titanic is beyond anyone s comprehension . 
the kit lens on my canon num_extend was much sharper . several days after lens arrived i attended the event . 
so they put one in the num_extend to get people to buy dvds to use it with . 
first off ,  i have used countless firewalls and have been involved in computers and networks for num_num years . 
collecting these silver rupees is way too similar to super mario num_num with the red coins . 
you do not need to eat dairy to get calcium . 
i bought battlefield num_num quite some time back ,  but found air power to be frustratingly overpowered . 
i did not feel like i got my money s worth . 
a boring num_num minutes spent working through the part of the level i d already completed ,  shoot the sniper . 
left it there for two more hours and he would not touch it . 
for the last couple of months ,  i have been stuck with an alarm that goes off every few hours . 
they literally had very sharp edges where the two halves of the ball are sealed together . 
it s persistent regardless where i am  inside ,  outside ,  car ,  etc .   . 
this was the first time i have ever seen them both turn down the same thing . 
we had heard that the treated surface may have harmful substances . well anyway . 
i am looking at two different boxes of baronet coffee pods . 
it is held together with cotter pins ,  the hinges are looser than use your imagination . 
her breath still occasionally smells like a fish market . 
i lost a lot of faith in the whole process of buying online over this incident . 
considering how expensive mallomars are ,  i will not be buying them again . 
every other similar playmat has heaps of toys and most have music and lights as well . 
the whole thing fits vertically in my pot with the lid on . 
i have a more bottom heavy conical breast shape . 
so we ended up with an overpriced stuffed animal that isn t very cuddly . 
by reading the review ,  and seeing the price i thought i d give it a shot . 
since i like my cuisinart food processor so much i thought i d give this machine a try . 
the rubber that connects to the hard plastic separated on every case that i owned . 
then i made another batch of that pizza dough . 
it will be even more difficult on uneven surfaces . 
num_num days lost messing with this and linksys tech support was really weak . 
for example ,  the game doesn t quite recognise my num_extend properly ,  and treats it as a num_extend instead . 
the timothy cubes were harder than a brick . 
however ,  unlike in the photo ,  the cups created an unnatural pointy shape . 
i d prefer a cheap  wing  type or waiter corkscrew to the pocket model . 
most of the attacks can be avoided by side stepping  strafing  . 
it also didn t add any volume or make my hair feel clean . 
zag are more expensive but i was not expecting the cheaper screens to be so bad . 
was hoping more from this product ,  i have other products that lasted me years so far . 
we contacted the company again ,  and haven t heard back from them . 
i m going with the plastic mount that secures with the pistol pin . 
finally i decided to try the microsoft mouse . 
i am not sure if the product was too diluted or it simply did not work . 
you also have time limits that you have to meet or the mission fails . 
the noodles are essentially tasteless yet ladened with num_num calories of saturated fats . 
just got it to use and clean my face sometimes . 
basically not much difference in this version or the num_extend
i can  find a better way to put this . 
i ve bought other cheap ropes in the past and they have broken quickly as well . 
i may never buy a protein bar again . 
you can only  course correct  it ,  as it drifts while moving forward . 
but this scent is a one shot pony :  it smells like natural sandalwood . 
my toddlers were thrilled when my friend got this for them to play with . 
this drill bit is far too small for the provided screw . 
this thing does not ,  so i m not carrying it . 
it was such thin material i had my doubts how it would feel on . 
i have since upgraded to the  l  series lens . 
but even num_num cup num_extend cup out of num_extend caused the same problems . 
it wasn t in the description but would have pushed it to a five star value . 
although it may be helpful for dry and damaged hair . 
you get what you pay for ,  i guess . 
i have had problems with the thread on the screw down crown and the auto movement . 
i love the texture of the blueberry larabar and it tastes so much better .  .  . to bad the larabar isn t raw !  . 
i had some bumps on my eye after applying it . 
in order of num_extend it is extremely loud . 
when you climb the cage ,  i didn t know what button to push to climb down . 
it s not samsung s fault as the phone itself has no issues with these buttons . 
ok i got scammed and sent it back . 
i must drive num_num hours to exchange this phone for another and hope it works . 
fix this problem and i might consider buying another one . 
it hasn t yet ,  but i worry about it breaking . 
the story was way past kewl and i kept wanting to know what happened next and stuff . 
i experienced dropped voip calls ,  lost my connection with all three laptops sporadically throughout the day . 
i can t tell you how disappointed i was . 
the font is different and the battery will not charge in your phone . 
unfortunately ,  on the basis of my experience ,  i cannot recommend this product . 
i was excited to try this after waking up after a late night . 
i got tired of leaving one either in my office or in my truck . 
the seller sent a replacement and the same thing occurred . 
every bag has little pieces of stem or other detritus . 
the touch screen is just an attraction to customers . 
i guess you get what you paid for !  . 
the shape and size of the bell is excellent . 
my biggest complaint about this is the distortion in the satellite speakers . 
the cutscenes are short and boring so you won t miss anything if you skip the scenes . 
these jtech num_extend bulbs were a very slight improvement ,  but not worth the trouble . 
it doesn t look cheap at first and within one month the silver started wearing off . 
i recommend speck candyshell cases ,  but make sure you re getting a legit one . 
just stale odor from old slippers and didn t do anything to change it . 
first i ll start out with the pros .  .  . it doesn t have and sulfates . 
this is a relatively new  mid num_extend home in the us built to code . 
i wear a num_extend and weigh num_num lbs . 
the battles ,  though the engine is innovative ,  are much to long . 
did not have any type of hazelnut flavor to the oil . 
i guess i will try this product one more time and see if i can get another good one . 
the pregnancy test seem better condition ,  but ill be buying from someone else . 
the little reed inside the bulb fell out of the end of the tube into the bulb . 
wish it had a green light for when set temp . 
i was optimistic after reading the other reviews ,  but wish i had not ordered this toy . 
i spent too much time figuring it out . 
these prepackaged curries are edible but not too tasty . 
the music is the same rehash garbage from every other cutesy japanese game . 
used linksys help desk ,  good support but the blinking light  defective  did not go away . 
it takes a long time ,  and even with the glove ,  it is hot work . 
it does not offer any sort of protection for the phone . 
she was still stressed when i got to the airport ,  so i gave her another one . 
the num_extend  a fifth of an ounce  of lotion for nearly $
i took out the brushes and cleaned them everytime i used it . 
i am a long time lover of kraft macaroni and cheese  the blue box please  . 
as far as the food feeder goes ,  i bought two ,  one for each cat . 
one positive ,  at this point ,  is that it did make it easier to scoop tidy cats . 
not great ,  but definitely more edible than the chocolate chips . 
a usb sync cable is a better idea . 
i tried sliding it down; that pulled the fine baby hairs on my neck very painfully . 
i tried them in my hair and they did work ,  but did not stay in well . 
i have two vehicles i tried both tramsmitters on ,  a nissan versa and a chevy venture . 
i bought these hoping i could wear them while jogging . 
apparently ,  it believes it knows where i should be looking better than i . 
got for droid incredible ,  first off the back cover will not attach fully . 
assortment count is lopsided ,  with one particular flavor outnumbering the rest . 
do not buy it !  it does not worth !  . 
i m still looking for an easy to use speaker to give to my family members . 
im a seasoned gamer ,  i have played and beat many games in different groups of gaming . 
i m happy that she likes it ,  however ,  a lot of the pieces do not stay together very well . 
i put two of them in strategic areas and the dogs barely bothered to scent them . 
i have purchased an estimated and used approximately num_num pair since that time . 
even when i tried to engage them and play with them they weren t interested . 
hard plastic piece next to flap at bottom cracked . 
it also didn t protect my face from oils popping through . 
i do not recommend these thin springs at all especially for kittens in particular . 
it s built on an android platform ,  which means it s buggy and randomly crashes or stops working . 
nothing but a bland mix of goo with tons of pepper and spices added to cover it up . 
this xt version came with scratches and would not sit flush on the ipad . 
then after two more months another sized head started doing the same thing . 
bought this for my one year old hoping it would provide some entertainment . 
the one major problem that i have with this game is that it seems very short and small . 
i was so excited when i heard karaoke revolution was coming out . 
this makes a very frustrating user experience ,  esp . 
my husband said he could smell me from across the room . 
if you want a lot more battery power ,  it s going to be heavier . 
after reading the ingredients ,  i realize that the taste is from the glycerin and ethanol . 
buy a smaller quantity first thought to be sure . 
don t get this espresso tamper wet the finish will come off instantly . 
don t waste your money and time with this piece of garbage . 
then they bunch up and make it really uncomfortable to pick up any weight . 
has phnoxyetanol .  . and it is too tick to put on my face . 
this product actually made my hair look worse than it did before i applied it . 
you re an alien sent to earth to .  .  .  . you guessed it ,  destroy humans . 
nice backside coverage ,  but i also did not like the feel of the straps . 
as a result ,  wood chips need to be removed between uses . 
i even removed the charcoal infused panel and even that didn t help . 
i don t know if i just got a bad one ,  but this toy was so dang flimsy . 
i feel this description on amazon is misleading . i think the seller needs to pull this product . 
i tried this thing because i do have lower back issues . 
so did the starlings . this feeder has a nice design ,  and it looks like it should work just fine . 
the package came partially opened and covered with this chalky powder . 
none of these things are good for ferrets and can actually lead to disease later in life . 
i would have to unknot it every other week or so . 
they live for their treats and are not especially picky about treats . 
i bought them to use with my iphone num_extend
i bought a generic grater at walmart for num_extend that has outlasted this one by a year . 
even at low volume it was tinny sounding . 
check your shipment !  if the concrete in the base is damaged in transit ,  just return this . 
what i also experienced was urine sitting on top of the litter . 
once again most likely made in china like must things sold at amazon . 
it has two extra small pockets other than the one for the camera . 
i don t mean crash through i mean it seemlessly passes through houses and bridges and anything else . 
i do have another company s speed loader which works much . 
i tried different size dried food but it still won t dispense any food . 
i could of polish my jewelry with a wash cloth and get better results then this expensive cloth . 
now we have a big jar of great smelling garlic we can t use . 
my dog eats like a vacuum cleaner ,  so i bought this bowl thinking it would slow her down . 
actually ,  it had already begun to come apart in the package . 
i m not saying that the japanese version is great ,  it s only slightly better . 
i don t know if they were mislabeled or what ,  but i sure wouldn t order again . 
it is really scratchy on my eyelids ,  and i don t consider myself delicate . 
do not buy them if you do as they will rip very quickly . 
he was so excited to get it and help set it up . 
i have gone through this same cycle num_num times now . 
it makes some of them sick and they have not touched it in two weeks . 
it doesn t seem like it ought to be ,  but it is a lot fussier than it looks . 
i have to completely alter my initial review . 
so i think that took the fun away . 
seek healthier alternatives ,  or just drink plain water instead . 
apparently this product is not on the menu for the moles in my area . 
amazon ,  however ,  is great as always in providing a refund for this item . 
the eyepiece protrudes too far into the camera body with my num_extend
i didn t feel any fuller when using them . 
hoped my extra two guest wimotes would fit . 
this mattress is too narrow to be comfortable . 
it s only redeeming quality is the built in dispenser ,  and that s not enough . 
my wife was very happy when she got the product . 
the item is fine but it s way too big and i ve used it once then i gave it away . 
i won t waste any other food by pouring this chocolate syrup on it . 
i wish i had not bought this as part of the purchase package . 
they wanted me to send the batteries into chatsworth ,  ca . 
i bought the diva cup ,  and these soft cups ,  at the same time . 
this one does not look like the picture  which looks more like the num_num model  . 
i recorded mostly off the radio and from my cd player onto my home md deck . here is my problem . 
no matter how i tried to use it ,  i could not get clean lines in sketchbook pro . 
i fail to see what else i could have done outside of following the instructions to make this work . 
i m pretty sure most mario fans feel the same way . 
this series of attacks is simply a beefy combo that you d normally pull off . 
very pretty bra but not supportive at all . 
once it blows ,  the grill is only good for a doorstop . 
i would suggestion moving to a new wireless n wireless router . 
if you manage to spend more than a few minutes online ,  your patience is greater than mine . 
i was literally wishing death to whoever designed these enemy while i was battling them . 
about one out of every num_num attempts it would send a fax . 
i do have a couple other old games installed there . 
then the company doesn t allow returns ,  only replacements . 
i ve used similar products so i didn t mind . 
have had to have spring reset it twice . 
don t sit on anything once it is inside ,  and preferably hold it by the base at all times . 
i had full dentures installed num_num months ago ,  and the lower has been a sliding nightmare when i eat . 
it would probably melt the insides and cause it to malfunction if you let it get too warm also . 
i had ,  unfortunately ,  very high expectations of this game . 
the battery has a groove at the bottom which makes it impossible to fit in the num_extend battery compartment . 
exceptfor its cleaning brush i threw the oxo out . 
it shoots num_extend at num_extend instead of num_extend num_extend
it smelled ok ,  not great ,  on me for like num_num minutes . 
i use them for woodworking machines and when cutting the grass . 
i bought this for my son for christmas . 
my body adapted . the silly bandages are sitting in a box . 
intuitive . the negativethis could have been made over a decade ago . 
other than this company s primary chew toy ,  i ll never purchase another thing from them again . 
i could almost say no just for azazel . 
the design is nice and it s compact ,  but it s practically useless due to the large inaccuracies it has . 
i got the num_num lbs version and it casts like knotted mess . 
it also has less carbonation than regular grape soda ,  which is a nice change . 
i ve heard good things about ancient organics but never tried it . 
when you give a mild shake ,  you can feel the handle move . 
i used a number of recent suggestions on this thread for oil ,  popping etc . 
did not do what it described and did not help with rosacea . 
they might be ok for disposable situations ,  but i would not buy these binoculars again . 
most have claimed it works on num_extend but this one does not for any of my num_extend games . 
i like this style of shoe for work . 
after about six months of use ,  my recorder started losing the ability to recognize commercial dvds . 
well i only used this one for a week ,  so can t really comment on the effectiveness i guess . 
i would in no way trust this out in the field . 
i bought this in an attempt to get oliva palermo locks . 
the fish are still swimming for their lives and any time they stop they get drawn against the foam . 
these were very poorly packaged and were a little damaged when i got them . 
i purchased a size up but they were still too tight . 
none of the downloadable files at the trendnet website are new enough to include win num_extend
i just hope the toy i ordered yesterday afternoon made by jw doesn t end up the same way . 
he promptly attempted to claw his way over my wife to get away from this thing . 
he doesn t smoke ,  or drink alochol ,  yet his teeth are beige . 
nobody liked this in my house ,  so i can t tell if it really calms them down or not . 
stay away from this product !  it leaves white buildup on all my dishes ,  glasses ,  cups ,  forks ,  ect . 
yet ,  when the tongs were cool they worked fine . 
when i plugged it into my computer ,  the whole computer turned off . 
at least the first ii double dragons showed something that made you feel like you had passed the game . 
so far my experience with the wii has been pretty bad . 
i generally like kong toys because they last but not with this dog . 
it cost me $ to find this out . 
total play time might have been num_num hours ,  was reasonably supervised ,  no extended periods or sleep time allowed . 
this cord shorted out in less than a week of use . 
of course ,  it wasn t just this one stage that seemed out of place . 
i happen to love popcorn balls ,  some people don t . update :  i only ate num_num bag of this stuff . 
i also used the recipe that came with the pan for the chocolate chip cookie . 
i did not stop to twist out the waves and loops that it formed while unrolling . 
overall i don t have a lot of beef with nyko but after buying this piece of crap i do . 
seriously ,  the logs are all contained in a quart sized baggy . 
now ,  with the xbox num_extend they have released yat another cheap port of the same old game . 
by the time the day ended i was nearly pulling the thing just to get it off . 
there is no shelf life for this game . 
i have gotten about num_num uses out of it . it has stopped charging however . 
so i contacted cs and arranged for a replacement . 
no skill needed whatsoever ,  just keep clicking away . 
i do like white chocolate and the options in protein bars are typically only chocolate or vanilla . 
i took tender loving care of it too . 
if you are set on a linksys ,  wait until they patch it completely . 
there are basically no open frequencies on the dial ,  and the sound was garbage when it did transmit . 
i wasn t sure if i was putting way too much ,  but it didn t end up doing anything . 
the taste is different from mainstream root beer ,  cola ,  and ginger ale products . 
as a few other reviews have said i find the jaws to be a bit weak . 
warning :  you could lose some fingers with that knife . 
i even added some catnip that he also likes ,  but still the fussy cat continued to ignore the bed . 
but to actually get it on the tube was a major headache . 
simply put ,  this is a poorly conceived product to begin with . furthermore ,  the build quality is cheap and flimsy . 
doesnt cover front screen which makes case worthless . 
i used it to tamp a num_extend portafilter ,  and it is too small . 
naturally occurring vitamin c is the same molecule as synthetic ascorbic acid . 
this game gives no explanation on how the hell he returns . 
you are supposed to wind it around the pole ,  and then hit it as it unwinds . 
these are magnets and are supposed to reduce noise transmissions . 
but about num_num months into ownership ,  the scroll wheel stopped working . 
i did not see a difference in his behavior . 
can t wait for sly cooper :  thieves in time !  . 
a slightly loose and comfortable fit that used to be the original num_num is gone . i wouldn t recommend these . 
at first ,  i achieved an inconsistent ,  coarse grind . 
sure ,  the graphics are stellar ,  but the load times are ridiculous for your average gamer . 
i am fostering a num_num lb italian greyhound . 
unfortunately ,  i can t do a great job of reviewing this product . 
with my first taste ,  it was diffidently real juice and it went down very smooth . 
definitely a manufacturing flaw ,  but for the price ,  what do you expect ?  . 
they re not very sharp ,  so the angle has to be just right to cut . 
i had to return this item for it was too large for my dog . 
i have to guess which is which size ,  and while it s not that difficult ,  it s inconvenient . 
the lock itself is everything you would expect it to be ,  compact ,  secure ,  and perfect for commuting . 
if you want to play good volleyball :  look somewhere else . 
digital cameras can correct for light sources ,  so this filter is for the bin . 
i will be looking to purchase a separate haunch holder . 
i am going to try using the num_num inch or num_num inch high one . 
i applied this for the first time after my morning shower today . 
this coffee was no different than any of gloria jean s kcups . 
i followed the directions ,  installing the software to my hard drive ,  then running it . 
it did not help with insomnia at all . 
when it worked ,  it had plenty of power to make smoothies . 
the mophie air still looks so much nicer . 
the build actually feels as if the zoom and focus mechanisms use internal cardboard components . 
the infuser basket doesn t sit well and gets stuck when you try to take it out . 
a few minutes before the test i used the meter and it displayed a level of num_extend
the best i got was water that was cooler than the outside temperature ,  and yogurt that did not turn . 
so i decided to buy num_num packs of these and they are not the same quality . 
this machine should basically be renamed or discontinued . 
like it is with hearing aids ,  the sensor industry has not kept up with the digital revolution . 
but ,  frankly ,  i did not find this so interesting either . 
the optics were so bad i had to return this scope . 
either way ,  that s a lot of money down the drain . 
i have bought num_num sets ,  in the last num_num months . 
i sometimes meet people who say that it is a lot better to have vr . 
i think it works ok but i couldn t stand the smell to try it long enough . 
the packing of the shoe was not that of a new pair of shoes . 
there s inconsistent information about the length of protection the product provides under perfect conditions . 
it broke the second day i had it . 
after the beach and shower i need a moisturizer . 
that is ,  my brain associates taking pills with going to sleep ,  regardless of what it is . 
i was very careful with it while using it ,  storing it ,  and washing it . 
the booklet even says it is only num_num watts ,  and i doubt it is really even that powerful . 
so im trying build  .  . instincts on the sticks . 
the watch body itself just pops right out of the rubbery band . 
i could use my num_extend for weeks before i needed to replace batteries . 
and it seems to have no skip protection for num_extend
especially when you can take that same amount of cash and buy some good coffee . 
it was a gift to my daughter and this product ,  in five days ,  injured her lips . 
as far as i m concerned this machine should have never made it to manufacturing . 
my dogs love the squirrel dude so i had high hopes for this  not purchased from amazon ,  my bad  . 
oh .  .  . and i don t have to use any other acne product in conjunction with the soap . 
so this jerky is good ,  but not worth the premium any more . 
but when i put this on her face . 
coffee and gave them required info and they sent a new one at no charge . 
maybe this was a good machine when it was first manufactured ,  but now it s a total rip off . 
if i wouldn t have opened the entire package already ,  i would be returning this tool set . 
i believe that unlimited saga is one of them . 
as i was walking out of the garage i heard a hisssss . 
keep in mind that the blue light can be very distracting when driving at night . 
the quality of this show simply doesn t exist . 
the pyrex is about num_num times the thickness !  . 
i just started at the toe and crept up my foot . 
thus ,  i must press down harder to tap on that area of the screen . 
they have removed or changed every single weapon in the game . 
it is exactly the same cheese youd get in the kraft box . 
we definitely have a small infestation of moths in our home . 
my husband ,  who doesn t take as warm of showers as i do ,  likes it ,  though . 
it is made of what looks like pvc piping ,  the tower is not wood ,  but carpet over plastic tube . 
i decided to order it in num_num sizes too large to get the loose feel i was looking for . 
also ,  the interior materials are much cheaper and have a mass produced quality to them . 
a few drops of mio caused the water in my glass to turn brownish red . 
this is a green stevia ,  the true cut from the plant ,  not the processed white stevia . 
it got gross up on my pillow and then i broke out . 
it does ,  however ,  make me angry . if the missions themselves were good ,  this wouldn t matter ,  but they re not . 
these were supposed to be stocking stuffers ,  but i don t give people stuff i don t recommend myself . 
if you want an num_extend player ,  this is not it . 
there is no volume adjustment ,  it s all just loud and grating . 
i bought this in hope of avoiding flour spills . 
i was in the bathroom with the shower on and i had washed my hands etc . 
oster should spend more time testing their products . 
it was made by universal interactive instead of insomniac ,  who wrote the old spyro games . 
it takes longer to incorporate the flour ,  and spills are actually more likely . 
might be a setting ,  but a frigging google device should have seamless gmail . 
i read a few bad reviews ,  and after having bought this item ,  i decided to stay away . 
like many of the other previous reviewers ,  i bought the game because the demo was outstanding . 
i m a little unimpressed with the mojo bars . 
i don t smoke at all but i do eat a moderate amount of spicy foods . 
now ,  i own num_num pairs of these exact pants that about num_num years old . 
the whole  amusement park  setting ,  a lackluster wagering system ,  etc .   . 
i can not charge two phones or battery chargers . 
l oreal voluminous false fiber lashes is better for temporary lengthening . 
i set my num_num boxes aside and ordered timothys . 
it had brand new batteries last week ,  but i put in two more freshly opened batteries today . 
what are they ,  ,  , crazy ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  i have never seen such an overpriced product in my life !  i am not kidding . 
i even applied it to my arm and noticed it caused redness there too . 
the storyline is basically the same :  run around ancient places doing flips and sommersaults ,  and avoiding trips . 
the second problem is its lack of incentives . 
i guess some people have better luck with it . 
so just because its num_num dollars less dont think it is just as good . 
i have complained but heard nothing about it . 
the first one i received was packed in a larger cardboard box with other items i ordered . 
i have very thin ,  fine hair that doesn t hold a curl well . 
i was hoping that this item would be a way to hear my iphone better but alas . 
and yes it fit perfectly in the correct phone it was made for . 
they are not soft  in fact ,  they are pretty stiff and itchy  . 
of course ,  once you re asleep then that s not an issue . the mask strap stays in place on my head . 
this is the bulkiest otter box deffender i have ever owned . 
i like my juice to give me a little more kick . 
it s not like i had the sun at high noon with a magnifying glass in front of this thing . 
now ,  don t get me wrong ,  there are definitely some good things about this game . 
soe decided to push it to live a whole num_num weeks sooner than that . 
i can t believe i even bought this ,  cheap flimsy piece of metal with an expensive price tag . 
this blends terribly ,  to the point where it will not blend even after using the brush multiple times . 
shooting from aperature priority  in all ranges  to shutter priority ,  the lens is simply poor quality . 
i am not sure whether this product works or not . 
they are not safe to wear because they will come undone and you will loose them . 
maybe should ve given it more time and practice . 
the corners on these don t stick to the phone well . 
if that first meal is undercooked ,  etc .  ,  the customer is hesitant to return . 
you can make up your own mind how big an issue it is for you . 
but now the counter has started losing its place regularly . 
you ve been warned ! the zyliss susi num_num garlic press is not shown with a cleaner on amazon . 
in summary ,  i went back to num_extend and love it very much . 
we bought this for my daughter a month ago because she fit into the age recommendation . 
this is the pain lovers best friend because you re going to be experiencing just that . 
these speakers were a cheap way to replace non working speakers in an old car . 
if you want to try it ,  try it at home !  i am not messing with this stuff again . 
i think it got the big head ,  though because it quickly decided it was too good to work . 
the  whistle  isn t very loud .  .  . and my dog is not at all fond of playing with it . 
with the  cuts+more  ,  the holes are narrower so my fingers don t comfortably fit in . 
i bought a half pound of beef and turkey from my butcher . 
in the stores this case is over $
really i d rather play pretty much any fps game over this one . 
the mount won t keep the phone upright enough to see it . 
i was excited because the package said you can use it in the laundry . 
it s not like things are doomed to be low quality just because they originate in asia . 
also ,  ineffective on a dog who will throw it s front paw up to try to remove the collar . 
this did keep them entertained but made a huge mess . 
the smallest of these brushes will not fit through the opening of those bottles . 
returned them in favor of a pair of sebagos . 
it is really cute ,  and my kids love it . 
the bottom has an inlet and and outlet that is usually covered with a cap . 
tried this over our regular brand and noticed the whole room started smelling like ammonia . 
i just want some normal looking adventurers ,  yet many of the models are too strange looking . 
the securom drm contained in spore is for implementing ea s new stand alone pc game subscription business model . 
no stem to plug the head into the phone was found . 
these jockey briefs are good quality ,  but jockey has a sizing problem between sizes num_num and num_extend
many newer tvs  like the ones i have  have y pb pr connections . 
i have just returned the second unit for a refund . 
i can now remove my lenses myself with no assistance . 
i read all the reviews and decided to give it a try . 
i researched restaurant supply places and found num_num cups for the same price and they work great . 
the length however is more like a size num_extend
this is a cheap counterfeit battery ,  they got the label almost perfect . 
 i currently have the samsung captivate and i am frustrated with the lags ,  inaccurate gps ,  and frequent freezes . 
be careful in the bathtub as it will melt caulking !  . 
it may work for a hike but not a good camping item . 
there will be times you ll ask yourself  can anyone beat this game ?  !   . 
it s a nice beach color but i wouldn t have paid this kind of money for a beach color . 
i have fine long hair and this brush just didn t go through my hair and do anything . 
i recognized the smell from when i used to take nordic naturals ultimate omega . 
i don t see how anyone could possibly eat one of these things while you were exercising . 
label over digital controls was off and would not stick on . 
eventually it just crapped out completely ,  and i was glad to put it in the trash . 
hold hair up and back comb down in one direction  not back and forth  . 
like so many other people i ignored the bad reviews and focused on the good ones . 
i inserted the cable in thepyle home num_extend network cable testerand it did not latch well . 
like going into a mission or defending your turf . 
however ,  after num_num month the buttons stopped working and after num_num months the audio jack died . 
i even left this dye on for num_num minutes . 
for example ,  the main thing you will be doing is simply exploring springfield . 
i love the chicken pilaf and tortilla soup by dr . 
several of them were broken upon arrival and the packaging was in perfect shape . 
the material feels cheep and plastic too !  i would not recommend !  . 
i did not bother to check the mic . 
the scope is nice but the elevation and windage knobs are crap . 
on the high setting it sounds about like a hair dryer on high . 
for the price ,  i guess it s fine ,  but it wasn t what i expected . 
it looked perfectly fine ,  seemed to pair pretty easily when i turned it on . 
number one on the list is saltoh yeah !  lottsa salt . 
thq is going down the drain just like its wwe counterpart . 
i should have returned them when i had the chance . 
but ,  they have changed the formula for this lotion by adding less cocoa butter and shea . 
if you think that s annoying once ,  imagine that for nearly every enemy and your own guys too very often . 
how disappointed we were to see how much the game had shrunk since our youth . 
the phone was even plugged into the charger ,  so it should have stayed on . 
this was only a num_num month supply for my num_extend dog . 
that starts are a shaky mess that don t really look very much brighter than without them . 
i had to use two bath towels to sop up the water from the floor . 
i have other onesie brand like gerber and the other extenders still dont fit . 
but i cannot for the life of me understand why this is a franchise . 
the device offers num_num transmission frequencies to choose from  which are public by the way  . 
all i did was try to pull it num_extend for num_extend
it s extremely annoying to wrap up and store anywhere . 
i have tried adjusting the screw to no avail . 
this game gets real old and slow after a day or two . 
we started with this one but were loathe to drill into the door to secure it . 
well over all the truck does as it is advertised to do . 
i purchased this only to realize that i never looked up product size or battery capacity in mah . 
they are ok tasting  but not very sweet and rather bland . 
i studied all of the installation videos and instructions . 
i used to buy a bag of these like every couple of months for my two mini poodles . 
i should have rad the reviews before i purchased this one . 
still ,  i consulted the booklet to see if there was anything i was doing wrong . 
get a pump carrier if you are buying these . 
again another product that isn t cheap and doesn t do what it says it should . 
what should have been a gripping ,  intense action game is nothing more than a game that could have been . 
seems  resolved  doesn t mean they got the game to run . 
i figured tall grass blowing in the wind . 
i played this game for about num_num hours straight and came across no save points . 
it should be noted that shining force neo is not an rpg ,  but a real time action adventure game . 
i can make yogurt at home ,  but i thought it would be more convenient to get this machine . 
i wear an num_extend shoe and i fell between the s and m . 
let cool and pour all over yourself .  .  .  . same effect for pennies .  .  . barf !  . 
i first fit this to my dog when it arrived . 
there s no directions ,  no pick ,  nothing but this so called guitar . 
i didn t notice any improvement with this product ,  so it must not work for everyone . 
oh and please ignore wax paper person !  lol lol lol lol  !  hahahahahahahahaha !  . 
there are only two little packets of burn cream and two little packets of antibiotic cream . 
on normal though it starts to get interesting . 
i tried ,  i mean ,  i really tried to get into this game ,  but it is just horrible . 
the candy tastes really really sweet even  sugar free  is advertised . 
i guess my question is why i would fork over a chunk of money to reduce clutter . 
i wish i knew of a product that actually worked and did not smell like death . 
incredibly disappointing that nintendo abandoned the mushroom kingdom for something so generic . 
no matter how hard she pushed on them they would fall off within minutes . 
i ve taken her fiber products for many years ,  too . 
which i would also not recommend buying . never listen to the food network . 
it is a donated item if someone wants a warped pan . 
i finally helped him and all we found was about num_num tiny pebbles . 
there is always a beware when something is not quite up to snuff . 
i returned both units obviously they are vulnerable to some unknown frequencies . 
ffix came out ,  returning their roots and but still delivering a powerful classic . 
so if you re like me ,  don t buy this . 
perhaps my bottle is just defective in some way . 
one broke when i put in on the other broke within a day of use . 
arm and hammer was the same way for me . 
grocery stores overwhelm me !  so ,  i guess i shouldn t have taken a chance with this foundation . 
it s not as if i can tape it down or something ,  it simply ceases functioning . 
on the other hand ,  if you like your coffee meek and weak ,  you may well like this . 
the website description of  progressive magnetic resistance smoothly increases as the speed increases  is not true . 
i changed num_num batteries in one week ,  making sure my kids were always turning it off between uses . 
i thought that this was going to be clear ,  when you put it on it appears to white . 
with that said ,  it is good as play food ,  but not so good as dog food . 
you guys should really write instructions on how to get the case off after you put it on . 
blades aren t sharp and are already starting to rust on hers . 
not really a fig flavor like traditional fig newtons . 
we have not done anything differently ,  kept the normal changing litter schedule etc . 
i suspect any decent rain storm will wash it away . 
it has two internal fans in its tiny case ,  spinning at high rpms . 
i ve almost lost it multiple times ,  including having to jump into a river to swim after it once . 
maybe its just me ,  but i didn t see much difference . 
the cups on this bra seemed small and the band seems big . 
thanks for reading and i hope this helps . tony . 
in fact ,  i think i still might have one in the garage that i used a long time ago . 
hard to do !  i also compared the vitamin amounts to my prev . 
the before and after difference is minimal ,  and i still need num_extend
there are many people who have had severe reactions to these pills . 
have a good day and happy new year . 
but this ,  tekken num_extend is a big dissapointment . 
num_num months ago i bought a aqueon deluxe pack which came with this filter . 
they get to the point to where you feel like there is no padding in them . 
my little girl misses playing the games ,  so what the heck ,  we ll try again . 
also ,  the largest wooden  red  circle is very resistant to go on the dowel or come off of it . 
it came off immediately and it came off in patches . 
repeat ,  over and over again ,  as super short life . 
long story short ,  she said it s that cap that s hurting your head . 
i was going to return it but it has been a little while now so that isn t possible . 
i pointed this out so that no one can blame the damage on the agitator . 
it says whisper but there s nothing whisper about it . 
i will never understand why there is so much hype for halo . 
i bought this brush based off the amazing reviews on amazon but im failing to understand why . 
i got auburn and it s more like a brick red ,  . 
i bought this game thinking that it d be like a left for dead type of game . 
the click is not very loud ,  and one of my clickers didn t even work . 
it slows and even comes to a stop depending on you hold it . 
there was a lot of grit and impact pet fur in my unit when i opened it up . 
bought these for my nephew for his birthday because he is hooked on magic . 
this stuff seems to make no difference at all . 
this is why they can t advertise  no msg  on the label or in their advertising . 
i carried it in my pocket and it faded inside my coat jacket and faded on my hands too . 
tribes num_extend soldier of fortune ,  and num_extend arena all showed this problem . uninstalling the card was a pain as well . 
when the machine takes on a mind of its own and starts to trip you have something to hit . 
people need to grow up ,  get a grip on reality and think outside the   ?   box . 
num_num bucks is not worth the hassle of returning . 
without manipulating the width of the stretcher ,  you can easily pitch a nerve or injure your spine . 
ended up going to apple store ,  paying a fortune ,  but bought a product that worked . 
garbage ,  don t waste your money it fried after a few days . 
for styling ,  i use garnier fructis pure clean smoothing cream . 
i don t think i will buy it again . 
not to mention the bra makes your breast look pointy . 
if so ,  more power to you and you should get this mug . 
whatever they added in this one they need to do to the rest . 
what you are purchasing here is a  set  . 
then he accidentally bumped into a pair of slippers sitting nearby and jumped some more . 
amazon and wrangler need to put the country of manufacturing on the site when they sell a product . 
it seemed like it was gonna be a great quality product . 
coffee anyone ? yes i do not like it ,  but i see their num_extend they reduced the flavor significantly . 
i used to play this when i was a kid . 
it is truly bad enough to make you want to stop drinking coffee ! do not waste your money . 
the only reason i bought this is because it got good reviews . 
i shouldn t knock the product but it looked pretty ridiculous when i got it . 
my sister s dog was actually scared of this toy . 
there are no spells ,  no feats ,  no skills ,  no races ,  no classes . 
then you ll repeat . and trust me ,  the enemies are ridiculous . 
with num_num months to go to christmas i just thought she would enjoy them more now . 
frankly ,  anywhere you go you can get a better cup of coffee . 
yeah who knew right ?  removing it does not make the shoe any wider . 
or even like your pet ,  it worth it to get appropriate flea and tick detourants from your vet . 
my dog would have torn it off in two seconds flat if this toy would ve worked . 
i then screened the two grinds and visually examined the results . 
too long  ,  short ride  ,  long legs and num_num different labels on length  !  look awful on me . 
i ve tried and returned at least num_num headsets ranging from $ to $
but as i got better ,  i noticed that in moving from  beginner  to  normal  there was a jarring jump . 
discuss with your doctor which probiotic is right for you . 
we keep music on in our house and tend to enjoy most music . 
this one was at the very bottom of the ones they rated ,  and in my opinion ,  for good reason . 
oh and this is firewire only which is just useless in num_extend
what arrived were labeled num_extend totally different and inferior items . 
the size was perfect for any num_extend had that phone for about a year . 
it also seems to be leaving this weird residue . 
it will not work ,  it will never work ,  and it is a total waste of time and money . 
turn on and forget . however it began leaking water after a little more than num_num months of use . 
the product feels nice and warm going on ,  but it really hasn t done anything special for me . 
great if you want a mirror and not a smartphone . 
it s nice looking and seems very well constructed but just not what i was looking for . 
for me ,  i ll take something i can use out of the box ,  even if it means paying more . 
a couple seemed to be a smaller size than the rest . apparently these are made without attention to consistent quality . 
mappings can not be made from an external port to a different numbered port internally  i . e . 
even tho i ordered it in proper time allowing them to ship it . 
it s about the size of a serving spoon . 
using the r trigger to go down and up . 
first of all ,  this is tricky to use . 
i figured i would love their full flavor coconut oil . 
it was coated with a layer of oil . 
waste of time to purchase ! back to amazon for this little doggie . 
it was a pain cleaning up that tea powder . 
which works out to something like a % retinol solution . 
but i don t feel like a man shaving with pink soap that smells like perfume . 
and if your cat has bowel issues or loose stools ,  it s even worse . 
i put on these new num_extend and they were practically painted on ,  much to my suprise . 
i had to try it for myself to see if she was exaggering . 
these are worse quality than what you d get at the dollar store . 
no long term user made data storage on the num_extend
the games developement team is incompetent ,  abuseive ,  and disrespectful . 
none of my cats liked this catnip pawbreaker . 
i can see the sign of charging on my galaxy num_extend but it still as it is ,  no charging . 
when they get this noticeable ,  they are more of a pain than a joy to use ,  literaly . 
my toddler has already dropped one on her feet twice now ,  and it hurt . 
not a connoisseur at all ,  just flat out picky . 
i am constantly pulling the excess out through the loops or the clothes would be hitting the ground . 
after spraying this on my curls and  scrunching  upwards ,  i noticed that it got  sticky  . 
great idea .  .  . but sadly doesn t seal on my tub . 
there appears to be an engineering flaw in the plug connection for the microphone wire . 
they make good clips for hanging paper ,  lol . 
so ,  to use the stylus you have to hold the pen upside down . 
the stickiness was somewhat better ,  but eggs were all over . 
it smells awful and is way too greasy . 
they never had to opportunity to completely come out ,  and they are now dry . 
i am very surprised that a lot of people have this same problem . 
used it or a month with no changes in under eye puffiness . 
right out of the box it looks like it won t last very long . 
i have no idea why it happens but it happens frequently enough to mention . 
this chai by stash isn t bitter so much as just plsin bad . 
yes ,  it s extremely durable and it ll last a while .  .  . but ,  it smells awful . 
i was making rolls consisting of num_num cups whole wheat and num_num cups all purpose . 
i would expect more from a toy not purchased at the dollar store . 
moving both forward makes the vehicle go forward ,  both backwards brings it into reverse . 
it doesn t grind all the beans so your final cup of coffee is a bit weak . 
there are many alternatives including all clad non stick that are wonderful . 
it is light in weight and build quality is not good . 
the  normal mode  in this one ,  however is like  extreme  in most other games . 
it s convenient ,  but it just does not work as well as the old brush and patch method . 
i read the reviews before i bought them and a pair of jvc marshmallows . 
while using it would pull hair and make scratch marks . 
this is kind of a sucky blush palette . 
that sad face is exactly how i feel when using this as a leave in on my num_extend hair . 
this is nice in case you make a mistake or should you get damage to the protector . 
not a huge expense ,  i just shouldn t have had to make . 
i had to stop using it because my acne became out of control . 
this makes for a lot of weapon whoring and just frustration on the part of a lot of gamers . 
i look at the pictures and the title and order them . 
rooster didn t look too bad after that and i figured he was now safe for my babies . 
after that time i stopped taking it as it was no help what so ever for me . 
i wish websites like llbean had night vision . 
the gameplay map is divided into about num_num or num_num main sections . 
the photo on the amazon web site is deceptive . 
you would think the newer version would still be dependable . 
said it sounded like i was in a tunnel or was echoing . 
only plus is the hold the approved amount . 
worked for a couple weeks ,  then got all crackly . 
i bought it for less than $ shipped a year ago . 
only about half of the batteries actually worked . 
had to resoldier electronic devices back on board inside the device . 
eventually the charge light just changed to indicate a full charge .

when you turn it on ,  the switch shows a red light . 
sure the graphics and the sound are num_extend sure they are cool the first time you see them . 
i was expecting a heavier weight jersey fabric . 
althought this is slim and great looking i dont reccomend it . 
however ,  i feel that the coffee blend overpowers the vanilla flavor . 
i wore this for a week to really try it out ,  so i doubt i can return it . 
the phone started having issues with serious lag ,  slowdown ,  and just hardly responds anymore . 
problem here is that after just num_num rounds the muzzle break came flying off . 
they also promised to look into the issues with the item and delete it from their inventory if appropriate . 
most of my favorite games  tower of doom ,  utopia ,  and etc .  .  .   are unplayable . 
advertises noise reduction and based upon our trial we could not see that it even worked . 
i decided to try these small bags because most of the reviews were positive . we were very disappointed .

this kong duckie is just too tiny and a dangerous side for most ogs . 
i noticed that others ha this same comment about the glasses after i bought them . 
we had num_num cats to try it out on ,  and none of them would push it around . 
it is not a light mouse to move . third ,  moving around is not so much the problem . 
all in all ,  a bad bra that will be going back to the store . 
if you want a fighting game get tekken num_extend
worked good for a while ,  until it stopped . 
these pads save a great deal of work ,  are convenient and do the job . 
as others have noted ,  it s closer to ginger beer than ginger ale . 
i bought this leash to match the red puppia harness . 
i would recommend a high end hoya or tiffen . 
but after what they ve done to my system ,  there is no way i ll ever buy these again . 
its very average to mediocre as a action game . 
tried the other one too and same thing . 
this did not work for me at all . 
maybe i m just too much of a power user . 
whether or not you make it there before getting completely pissed of is a different question . 
i cannot express how embarrassing such a situation is . 
upon receiving this knife ,  straight out of the box it wasn t very sharp . 
these are in order starting with the best . 
the fact that the movie making experience is very limited ,  redundant ,  and totally lacking . 
i can actually touch it with my bare finger and it ll come off . 
the only reason i wore the glove is because i already paid for it . 
although the graphics may be fancy thats about it . 
the vertical stitching down the front of the foot was uncomfortable . 
so not an option to switch back to the metal . 
it is slow ,  the players are out of proportion and the overall effect just isn t there . 
i ve had otterbox commuter cases on other phones and have never had a problem whatsoever . 
so there is nothing in this milk for us . 
digits are small and not easy to read . 
the only thing good coming from this product is ,  its a decent conditioner after bleaching . 
i purchased these products from this brand as well as two others . 
i would save your money and buy a better game . 
i was constantly dealing with spills and loose media spraying here and there .

my scrambled eggs end up a mess and still taste bland . 
age of mythology ,  the original ,  is a great game . 
very disapointed for paying this much for such a poor quality product . 
i definetly wouldn t shell out $ for this game . 
that benefit can only be enjoyed by high definition television owners and . 
it now powers itself down as soon as it turns the lamp on . this projector is a dud !  . 
i ve used frontline on my cats and despite what anyone says ,  this stuff just doesn t work . 
i have had my nexus one for num_num month now and charged it almost daily during this time . 
the nuts were almost nonexistent .  .  .  . at least to the naked eye . 
initially ,  i doubted this was the traumeel ,  as it s natural ,  but the minute i stopped it the discomfort subsided . 
so know your size well and maybe contact the company before you buy one . 
this tastes metallic and about as far from peachy as you can get . 
i tried this product a few months ago . 
the bluetooth issue is what prompted me to return the phone . 
i can buy a better lotion for a fraction of this price . 
i have natural hair i m african american ,  and this is really not a good product for my hair . 
by the way ,  they also took over my original half life game . 
i have bought an ateco cake ruler now ,  which is sturdy aluminum and is working great for me . 
if you try to use this for root lift or volume ,  it gets horribly tangled . 
it may work out well for shorter hair ,  but not below shoulder length hair . 
it tasted way too sweet for my diabetic self . 
its such a nice scope ,  but not shock proof ?  thanks amazon . 
all in all ,  i do not recommend buying this product . 
i ended up buying strapping tape and attaching the top to the rear seat headrests . 
the photo on this item should be updated to reflect actual item . 
they claim to be only num_num net carbs online but i think this is a lie . 
well for one thing it has a smell  josie s had no smell  . 
very unpleasant ,  to the point where i threw out the bottle after a few sips . 
unfortunately ,  after using it for about num_num months ,  i went back to my regular plastic brush . 
any of the nikon coolpix series are infinitely superior . sorry ,  canon . 
i ended up with a pretty jank knee injury so i through them out .

those with the skills to pummel anyone who comes into the arena ,  and those who get pummeled . 
bummer really because this makes me favor xbox live all the more . 
the original amco had a nice weight to them and looked shiny and beautiful . 
this is a good trimmer as long as you do not open the lead to clean it up . 
forget about any size paperback ,  it will not work . 
i have a problem with hard plastic ear hooks . 
the intercept makes the optimus v look like a super phone . 
i bought these after reading the amazon reviews . 
i used on an old lg optimus ,  samsung sii ,  and asus tablet . 
our num_num month old lab mix made quick work of this . 
the create a superstar feature in num_extend was a joke . 
most of them are easy to spot ,  but not always easy to get . 
so i bought this game expecting good things . 
i recommend a kodak reader for your kodak cameras . 
having read the glowing reviews on amazon ,  i purchased this machine and am terribly disappointed at it s performance . 
it just didn t work for me ,  pretty usual for converters bought online . 
she will bat the ball a few times and walk away . 
the embroidery is made out of cheap fabric and it comes off . 
her main thing she uses it for is reading books from the library . 
while i drink about num_num oz of plain water daily ,  i enjoy drinking liquids that have some flavor . 
after purchasing this ,  i found that i still wear my cheap beach dress instead . 
i was hoping with the top heavy positive reviews ,  it would be a shoo in . 
hmmm ,  i wonder if i can recycle it ?  ?  ?  . 
i used it num_num times and it and only take my battery up num_num % and dies on me . 
it followed a very linear progression with no surprises or logic . 
then the actual seam began unraveling along the bottom of the slipper . 
just go buy an $ tarp from walmart . 
she otherwise likes balls ,  rattles and other items . 
this just isn t for me and i have discontinued using this product and cannot really recommend it . 
the texture of the case is awkward and pointless . 
i don t like the integration with facebook either . 
num_num minutes after application she doesnt mind the taste :   . 
several months back i was introduced to ninja theory s work through enslaved :  odyssey to the west . 
i would not totally recommend ,  but ty anyway . 
but when i opened the package and tried to place them on my head they would not fit . 
i have used the falsies mascara before in other colors and absolutely loved it . 
i had to pay expensive freight to ship them back the old one . 
then again ,  the num_extend costs a whopping $
this is way to bright and yellow as though color has been addded to it . 
this lens works great ,  quiet enough focus and covers a good range at a great price . 
i try it many different ways but no luck . 
even though i followed the directions closely ,  it never sprayed a mist of oil . 
when you tug on it ,  the phone should pop up . 
there s no technical reason why it needs to be this large . 
it s the standard rod that comes with the glock . 
the difficulty is horribly scaled and no preset difficulty option exists . 
product shipped at the last minute ,  arrived at the last date in the window . 
this included num_num eargels in the package . warning these are not a soft plastic ,  they are medium desity at best . 
my xbox num_num is doing just fine ,  and it has better graphics ,  imo . 
 fewer unpopped kernels ,   ha !  somewhere in the instructions it says you can t use small kernels . 
i doubt that many ,  unless their ethnic roots are korean or similar ,  will find this soup pleasing . 
it s such thin material ,  i don t really know what you would use it for . 
we all know the most dangerous knife is the dullest one . 
my dog destroyed this in about num_num minutes . 
this game has nothing to do with the original except in name and the use of timetravel . 
the material that they were made of was super brittle . 
of all the wheels i have owned ,  and that is many ,  this is by far the worst yet . 
i took these pills for about two weeks sometimes at the max dose . 
we have superglued other sets ,  and it just didn t help . 
i usually really love loreal products ,  but i m not impressed with this moisturizer at all . 
i am a num_num year old widow ,  handy ,  but i have a bum shoulder . 
others on the net are having similar troubles . 
it was then that i learned there are no returns on the crackers . 
nfl head coach goes team by team ,  and even has suggestions from your scout . 
i m are larger guy so it pinches me anywhere i put it . 
yeah the outrageous price annoyed me enough to post this . 
about the size of a quarter on a two year old s foot . 
the companies response was to update the unit . 
my children didn t seem to notice but i surely wouldn t buy them again . 
it is supposed to automatically check and download any patches and updates . 
i found the packets a pain in the rear to use every day too . 
then while we were cooking thanksgiving dinner my husband was using it . 
i bought this amazed to see it in the store and went home to play it rather eager . 
unless you want to chug your drink ,  be prepared for your drink to go flat . 
it works really good ,  then all of a sudden it doesn t work . 
my whole face will be flushed at times . 
i ve owned others for different phones but this one for the num_extend didn t work well at all . 
when these babies fail ,  performance falls like a lead balloon . 
i m a bit of a coffee snob and this simply isn t worth the brewing ,  even if it was free . 
this product is a buyer beware or buy at your own risk situation . 
there is no usb option provided with the basic palm for synching with usb num_extend
the horrible acne still did not go away !  !  !  . 
now there is absolutely nothing wrong with the quality of this product . 
it was a waste of money cause the batteries will not hold a charge . 
i ve been camping twice using this liner and i can t seem to pull the liner up past my hips . 
after reading the reviews i thought this would be a sure thing . 
if you get one that doesn t work ,  you can return it and try again . 
being a nokia fan ,  i purchased the num_extend
a drastically deep claim to make in such a powerful entertainment medium that revolves around technology . 
the shoes i bought were supposed to be the size i wear but ,  they are to long . 
since this product isn t fda approved ,  it worries me to use it . 
it usually doesn t phase me ,  but to have my daughter exposed to hearing curse words in almost every sentence . 
this defeated the purpose of owning a hand held . 
the small footprint and only needing to plug one thing in attracted me at first . 
don t do it girlfriends !  were all getting cancer from brazilian keratin treatments with formaldehyde and products like this !  . 
wish i read the reviews before i bought it . 
i still have one vital of part i left unopened and more than half of this part two left . 
thus ,  resulting in an inability to use it . 
such as shooting people in front of things like christmas trees . 
 empire earth  isn t the easiest game to learn . 
next i had another problem with another dogs bark setting it off . 
this is just a badly designed or flawed product . 
other than that ,  stick to the complete pc collection . 
plus ,  the smell bothers me long after the shower . 
we would give this toy a solid num_num stars if it weren t for the coughing sound effect . 
noticed some of the dvds were making noise and not playing properly . 
same price ,  $ and i have had it for num_num months and it still works perfectly . 
i ordered two of these clear cases for my iphone and i wish i never did . 
this worked for a few days and then the headset stopped working completely . 
as a daily urban bike commuter ,  these little things really are not sufficient by themselves . 
the texture is fine but the taste is not sitting well . 
the psp is deja vu all over again . 
ive always had good customer service from them but now they are just horrible . 
i strongly suggest using any product from olay total effects or regenerist lines . 
i am planning on calling bsa to ask them if i am doing anything wrong . 
ran out of the other brand and started using these again . 
i returned my jawbone after just one very frustrating day . all control buttons are hidden from view and touch . 
i wouldn t buy it if you are trying to get shredded or stay skinny . 
after waiting over num_num weeks ,  i receive a case that doesn t even fit my num_extend
use your noggin and decide what you believe . 
you would think sony would make it smaller after their first remote completley bombed . 
you will not only get blood ,  but a lot of good ,  fun violence . 
not worth it !  takes soo long to set up , then it s all done in two minutes . 
it is very loose and i use it mainly at home sitting in one position without moving . 
never bothered to fix ,  just gave them to my kid to play dress up with . 
its ridges are not symmetric and i doubt that my chemex would have balanced on this thing . 
and up until that time ,  it was working ok . 
also ,  the lines that go up the breasts show through certain shirts . 
it is probably easier to just empty the bin into a bag every day . 
hyperion s customer service was helpful and they responded very quickly when i contacted them . 
the other lights are probably the same way ,  all flashing red . 
i had also played a demo of one of the monkey island games and found it hilarious . 
they need to give us a tool to put them on . 
the problem is the cutter itself ,  not the storage . 
i installed the battery and followed all the instructions . 
variable temps ,  cool tip ,  and very fast heat up time are all very nice . 
the socks are going back and i know there are some from walmart that does not do that . 
the cord is ridiculously thin and fragile for a laptop . 
the experience is frustrating . i had high hopes for num_extend but it fell way short of being entertaining . 
it actually started to pull the car s power receptacle apart when i pulled hard . 
i bet i ll get one usage out of it . 
just this side of bite size . our batch was over baked . 
but i finally tried the chunky tomato bisque ,  and it was out of this world . 
i have another sports bra that eliminates bounce pretty well ,  but this one didn t do so hardly at all . 
i added butter ,  flavorings ,  parmesan cheese ,  but no luck . 
i m sure like many people i was drawn to the  color  of the screen . 
after that i realized that i was going to another dungeon type cave . 
in my gmc the music couldn t even cut through the static to be heard . 
omg i just can t believe it !  the product has changed after all these years . 
this toy cost around $ and for this kind of money ,  i expect quality . 
i am not going to buy any of their wood products again . 
this toy is a piece of junk that only worked for a month . 
it tastes watered down and trying to make a stronger cup does not create flavor . 
if you push up both joy sticks the car does not drive stright . 
don t waste your money buying this ,  buy the ea version ,  or take your chances with next years version . 
they have what you need to see the results you want . 
it takes my phone at least num_num hours to charge everytime and it s not my battery .  .  . never again . 
of ants that did not make it through their journey alive . 
the standard speakers in my num_extend honda civic are better than these . 
this case looked cool and seemed to offer good protection . 
my phone bill is cheap  virgin  and i love the android os . 
savor the taste because it only last num_num seconds . 
i think some section of memory might have gone bad . 
too bulky to wear at the card table ,  but like it when it works . 
i ordered four bottles of this red glaze from impossible discounts through amazon . 
i m very disappointed . suggestion to plantronics :  making different style earbuds available for their headsets . 
anyways ,  this game is a waste of money . 
it may be better but if they can t eat it ,  no good . 
the royal castle  of this piece o  trash . 
i have no problem with his initial barking ,  in fact i welcome it . 
i didn t like it and wouldn t recommend it . 
it also costs three times what regular digital camera memory  flash  costs . 
well ,  there s competition now ,  and the competition is better . 
unfortunately ,  on me ,  it morphs into a body odor smell shortly afterward . 
if those brown granules are supposed to be exfoliating bits ,  i couldn t feel them at all . 
i have a fobus paddle holster which is awesome . 
very deceiving for amazon ,  and potentially a legal suit in the making !  . 
i will never knowingly buy anything made in china or any other communist nation . 
it did this on both my pc and my mac . 
since i probably wont keep using them ,  i splurged on trash . 
needless to say i am returning this palette immediately . 
there are no unnecessary abilities in that game . 
they should also be replaced with others who can appreciate the value of good customer loyalty . 
i might try it again if i had confidence about the color choice . 
it looks neat but the controls are located right above where the hot steam ventilates . 
i purchased this together with the catit track . 
i thought neoprene would be smoother and not dig into the side of my foot . 
or more to go to another page ,  wireless or connected . 
i can only think of poor pricilla presley s grotesque look on dwts after botched plastic surgery . 
my first attempt at leaving a review was denied by amazon . 
i suspect that amazon just sent me back what i had returned . 
we re never given important elements of the story and the main character just seems wrong . 
her heel lifts with every step ,  and they re stiff and heavy . 
too messy ,  too small ,  leaks too much ,  too much trouble and to hard to clean . 
no surprise as it is hard to find a springform pan that does not leak . 
this is a very tiny and an extremely thin product . 
i am returning it the moment i saw this at my house . 
another rep said to go to radio shack and buy a wireless phone jack ,  which didn t work either . 
unfortunately ,  the voice clarity was laughable and there was a constant num_extend humming . 
with the handle being that it curves inward it is very awkward to get use to . 
but the bottom line is ,  i would use any litter over this one . 
upon installing the software and rebooting the card came up ok for the first few time . 
my entire world becomes a huge skatepark ,  as i start looking for a good skating line everywhere i go . 
i never removed any of the other dishes to see if any others were broken . 
the graphics were what i expected ,  not bad ,  but not superior . 
i received it in a timely fashion ,  and well packaged . 
the reel works well ,  so this is not a charger that will get in your way . 
spent more time pushing them back in my ears . 
while it mostly fit ,  it pushed my bust together and sort of looked like . 
the sound is pretty decent if your willing to hold them against your ears . 
the router will only keep both wans up if you have it in auto load balance mode . 
okay i just tried playing the demo of this game because someone advised this . 
i bought this for my older pugs ,  but the tablets are much too large for them . 
this this is % cheap plastic and i wouldn t recommend it to anyone . 
you need to press very hard; it hurts your hair . 
then you have to pop the straight piece back on the phone . 
step num_num in the instructions and realized the thing is junk . do your self a favor and get something else . 
i will come out of my pocket to get better results . 
i am rating this on my son s experience . 
i left it outside for starving wild cats and they would not eat it either . 
the qoutes in the game really are stupid . 
i don t think this product works for me . 
i like revlon lipstick because they have a decent line of matte lipsticks but this is a dud . 
while it does show pin num_num missing in the picture ,  i wish i had also seen that . 
it s a great little mirror ,  but won t stick to my helmet . 
you get much better quality and ease of preparation . 
the game is bad ,  very bad ,  and it has a number of reasons why . 
i ve worn them for a while ,  they are my go to loungers . 
then num_num minutes later i tried halo ,  then num_extend and num_num more games . 
they rubbed the top of my feet so badly that me feet almost started to bleed in spots . 
it was not cheap now maybelline liners price and no good . 
for this phone ,  if you send over the maximum amount of characters ,  it would refuse to send the text . 
it s in the pool room and does ok but once you try to turn it up it bottoms out . 
the necrons are so easy to win with its boring . 
the game was playable before the combat revamp . 
i have a whole bunch left and don t know what to do with it . 
it didn t provide the result that were expected . 
rating on the actual product that i once owned ,  but lost ,  is num_num stars ,  hands down . 
plenty of people seem to like this shaving oil . 
i took this version also because it is suppose to be easy on the stomach . 
the game looks great and plays fast but that s about all . 
this game is an embarrassment to the star wars license and mmo s . 
that s about the best thing i can say about this product . 
you could see the place where it had fallen off . 
i contacted the seller to see about swapping them out asap . 
first off ,  i was excited about this toy . 
i will say it can only fit a num_extend screen . 
i never noticed that with the other brands . 
decent . i had way better success with egyptian goddess ,  though !  . 
and now it s off to work with no sleep . 
with absolutely no instructions !  !  !  it took me so long ,  i just gave up . 
but instead of sensing sugar ,  salt ,  bitter ,  savory and sour they sense pain ,  pressure ,  hot ,  and cold . 
neck and arms fit well but the torso was made for someone maybe num_num pounds heavier . 
you can form your own opinions about that ,  but i have to admit that i felt a bit taken . 
i kept them though for gift . edit :  flat and kind of cheap looking when you wear them . 
i would not recommend this to a friend . 
this was not the same crepe rubber as the other lauri toys i have . 
well let me start by saying  my wife does not do well with technology . 
the speedloader doesn t even feed in half way to the cylinder before it gets stuck . 
but in no way does this shirt compare to my older shirts . 
i don t have any mse super mafer clamps or i might have come up with a slightly different solution . 
so i had to connect the recharging cable with it all the time . 
i wish num_extend was still making the homm series . 
the optical quality is really not very good ,  producing blurry images the higher the magnification being used . 
however ,  the two bottle i just purchased leaves a lot to be desired . 
the gears go bad ,  and repair is only temporary ,  even by kodak . 
they were too large in diameter to fit into the breach . 
to include a technology that may be outdated within a handful of years ,  especially one this expensive ,  is ludicrous . 
they were helpful ,  and obviously used to getting that question . 
just that line makes you want to go over to circuit city and buy this game . 
i got this for my four year old for christmas last year . 
at first i thought it was really good too ,  until i started playing more . 
do not buy !  ! how do i send this battery back  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  . 
the magnetic latch on the drawers broke after two days . 
it was easy to use and best of all they updated their code archive quickly to reflect new releases . 
i thought it was just ok . how about me ? you ll have to try it for yourself . 
its not a light scent ,  its heavy and perfumy and gags me . 
in conclusion this product is absolutly useless with windows num_extend
oops ,  the edges are raw ,  so we better overstitch them so they don t unravel . 
material seems cheap though it does work as advertised so far . 
my son loves music and i thought this would be the perfect gift for him . 
it s just not worth the current price ,  and it has too many flaws to use for serious athletes . 
for the price i expected a much higher quality collar . 
i decided to replace my stock factory radio with a pioneer with usb . 
good enough for num_num bucks . update :  the liner lock has quick working . 
in truth ,  it does very little to improve the problems . for fingerprints and the like ,  use a cloth . 
i did not find these gloves very helpful . 
they put out a crappy product !  i wonder what quality control they have wherever they re made in china . 
my dog liked it but what doesn t he like . 
i put liquid kaz and still no difference . 
i would not spend one cent on this . 
i wait until the movement of litter has stopped and start to rotate it back to the left ,  gently . 
it started out making very good froth very quickly ,  just like the bonjour . 
i spent num_extend dollars for this card at target . 
they are also too wide to fit into the ports on a netgear num_extend switch . 
i d give it to her for an hour or two ,  each day . 
if i wanted this thing fixed i had to shell out the money to get it working again . 
i wrote a positive review earlier ,  but i m retracting it because this was a complete waste of money . 
for a cereal that has the word  nut  in it s name twice ,  i expected more . overall ,  this cereal is fine . 
looks like a pretty doll but not worth it . 
previously ,  a levis jeans was a piece  almost perfect  ,  today i can not say the same . 
my skin has relatively normal texture :  neither excessively oily nor excessively dry . 
this game can put you to sleep faster than sleeping pills . 
the damage has been done to my snails . 
so this leaves you to kill the over num_num nazi s plus the two tanks that are on this level . 
i used this product while having braids ,  so i needed something to keep my scalp cleansed . 
this was enough to make it not fit the oven; i couldn t close the door completely . 
my kid bumped his head several times against it ,  getting visible bruises . 
buy them . update :  the coating on this case is peeling off everywhere . 
it doesnt work as well as it says . 
how useless it that !  !  ?  ? this card is junk !  !  but at least it doesn t freeze my computer . 
they said  send it back and we will credit you  . 
you should only have to pay for features . i ve tested plantronics num_extend num_extend
i returned this unit and ordered a replacement beaker as i had originally intended; sadder but wiser . 
i think i d have to add the whole bottle for adequate results . 
at least not in the applications that i really want to . 
the tangerine overpowered the orange and left a bad taste in my mouth . 
to confirm my findings i did extensive testing and actually read the firewall logs . 
this holster was purchased for a glock num_num gen num_num and does not work well at all . 
the size of the bar is about half of what is shown on the box . 
no wires to plug and unplug ,  no more having several chargers plugged in the wall outlet . 
it was on the basis of loving that pan that i went ahead and bought the num_num piece set . 
characters never get as interesting as they were in num_extend and when you re on the third cd . 
if this is  german craftmanship  you can have it . 
i have a yorkie mix and an australian shepard mix . 
i decided keeping it is the only choice . 
after all ,  two years is more than enough time for him to grow up and become a man already . 
unless i work for all num_num six of them ;  that would be something . 
with a pan of scalloped potatoes in it ,  it had a hard time getting hot enough to cook them . 
of all the rolling stones catalog ,  why would forty licks   paint it black  be the one to appear . 
both chinchillas were not interested ,  including the one who seems to want to eat almost anything . 
this does not mean it has more action ,  no . 
i bought two of these horses for my daughters for a gift . 
anything less than num_num and it was barely warm ,  anything more than num_num and it was burnt . 
i did some research online ,  here at amazon before purchasing . 
the plugs do not stay in and although colorful ,  color does not get the job done . 
my face was red and felt like it would explode . 
i have been disappointed in my pyrex ones as the printed measurements keep on coming off . 
i have tried this turner in many different situations and i just don t like it . 
however ,  as you further play through the game ,  the more and more apparent the bugs and glitches become . 
the rite aid cap can be opened with my front teeth ,  or with two fingers . 
i clearly see my being sick is related to this product . 
the side with the light switch also has a little lamp and a book . 
don t expect to last a life time as you would most speaker systems . 
they look great ,  smell great !  the only thing i noticed is that they re hard as all get out . 
had to resort to my usual ibuprofen and sudafed combo for relief . 
otterbox has lost a loyal customer over this . 
when you are setting the time it beeps whenever any button is pushed which is annoying . 
frankly ,  even if it is low acid ,  i can t  stomach  the taste . 
the first kettle started to leak past the return date so i was stuck . 
i then used it with an acer laptop i was using as a htpc . 
this is more of a review of amazon than it is of this kettle . 
so do your homework ,  google it ,  as i did !  . 
i hoped if i sized up the rise would be ok ,  but it made no difference . 
these have a lower profile especially num_num tbsp  which means they are shorter and wider . 
the amazon catalog entry gives the impression that both the scale and tray are metal ,  finished in chrome . 
no amount of paper clip resetting will fix this . 
i remove the heater from the water and touch the barrel .  .  . nothiing . 
cds last longer ,  and in truth ,  are harder to damage . 
five minutes later she has chewed apart the velcro and the top of the bottle was sticking out . 
does not remove the water spots that i purchased it for . 
the local vacuum repair guy refuses to repair steamvacs . 
num_num mg of iron daily and not num_num mg . 
also ,  i had already scored num_num goals by that point . 
this hammer is a thing of beauty ,  but  to my surprise  you can t wash it in the dishwasher . 
the train would say car and vice versa . 
too bad amazon doesn t allow ratings of negative stars . 
if there s no demands for disposable toxic products ,  then companies won t make them . 
the doll also ripped at the entire back seem ,  and begin stain is was unrepairable . 
do yourself a favor and spend a little more money on a better brand . 
when you tried to pour ,  the lid fell off and made a mess . 
the battery wouldnt hold a charge and the charger doesnt output anything . 
i bought this to update my escort passport radar detector . 
looks and feels just like an oem part . 
the games following ocarina of time perfected the zelda formula way more effectively . 
the screen enclosure ,  which the lay against when they sun bathing , is next to grass . 
all sony s have this but for some reason ,  the top of the line palm does not . 
but at least it s not itchy ! what s shocking is that i m usually not allergic to anything . 
my daughter refused to wear this on halloween . 
for a game this long and complex ,  it is strange for it to have quite this much direct conflict . 
its story is so werid and freaked out that i can t understand it at all . 
the material is very heavy and bulky ,  and rough ,  as if they are to be used in construction . 
i do not recommend this item as it smells bad and the dog will not eat it . 
these shoes look cute before they are in my size num_num foot . 
in fact i don t think it even kicked in . 
so ,  i bought this product and some durachews in anticipation of future needs . 
it is probably best for girls with straight hair . 
i ordered the blue and white striped shoes . 
maybe will find a use for it down the road . 
it did nothing to protect my $ device . 
i do keep one in my tool kit just incase . 
i own this pocket pc for less than two years; it already gives up on me . 
there is not a scratch on them that would have happened if they were dropped . 
it tastes bad while drinking it and then ,  as a bonus ,  it leaves a nasty aftertaste . 
maybe i got a bad bottle ,  but it was very thick ,  streaky and my my nails looked like death . 
the doors on this thing should be attatched better ,  and barring that ,  the toy should be recalled . 
this coffee machine delivers typical american style coffee . 
i purchased this product  medium size  from another website eight years ago . 
all in all the beautiful graphics were wasted in a game that had nothing going for it . 
no matter what you have in mind for this mighty bright ,  i suggest you move on . 
if your idea of a bar is something sweet and mushy ,  then go for it . 
i paid num_extend for them but still am not happy that i even purchased this item . 
this is a good target but it is too small . 
unfortunately ,  this did not help or hurt ,  even combined with the prozac and other herbal remedies . 
i like it  ,  wish i could have used it . 
he kickstand quickly snaps into place and stores away when not needed . 
did not work for  my touch  num_extend phone . 
i purchased this num_extend rainmaker for my num_num year old for christmas after some pretty great reviews . 
the consistency was odd; it was kind of wet and the texture was grainy . 
i m really not sure how i could use it actually !  . 
it doesn t help that it is also held in place by cardboard ,  so it s not very sturdy . 
big mistake . imagine my disappointment when i unpacked severally damaged item . 
disgusting herby smell is too heavy for home or anywhere . 
not one of my three cats would do more than sniff it and back away . 
i am a month into using this one ,  and it does nothing . 
it was suppose to me a belated birthday gift which was ruined . 
i thought this company was consistant with their product value . 
what i did not expect was for the cans to come from china . 
this is pretty good and very easy to use . 
i tried numerous times to send it back . 
i bought four of these sweaters for my dogs; two red and two blue . 
and then it moves erratically ,  or will only go sideways .  .  . drives me nuts . 
they are not that great ,  they taste so artificial and lack in major taste . 
these in fact are intended to be used as bag gloves . 
the buttons do not line up on the case properly which makes the casemhard to use . 
what you d expect ,  coupled with very little peanut butter flavor . 
it also takes a good while to warm up at all . 
the aftertaste was terrible and i had to throw away the remaining coffee . 
the frame that rests on the back of your head broke the first season i had this . 
the plastic is flabby and moves a lot ,  and doesn t sit tight on the phone . 
i was really disappointed and had to return them all . 
i thought the idea behind these cutting boards was great in concept ,  but in practice ,  these are pretty terrible . 
i didn t want to waste our money so i give the treats to our dogs with training sessions . 
i am hungry for some salmon ,  will need to go to the store or find it on here . 
as it is ,  i certainly won t be buying it in the future . 
i would like to hopefully continue the former tradition with my children . 
my num_num month old daughter loves this toy . 
unless mine were an anomaly ,  order up at least a size . 
not sure if they make an industrial strength car phone charger . 
well ,  when i opened the box ,  i couldn t believe my eyes . 
the blocks fall out of the stackeron their own ,  or won t fall out when you push the button . 
i will wear them again but for now they are sitting in my closet . 
most of them repeatedly asked questions that suggested that they didn t understand how the feature worked . 
the aquis has a label sewn in saying it is aquis . 
we found this game to be really dull . 
i tried to put it back together but had no luck . 
don t waste your money !  pay the extra money and purchase the zaq allay !  awesome !  . 
others note how with use a static charge will build and hair will cling . 
good for my num_num year old to play with . 
i only have him num_num teeny greenies on num_num separate occasions ,  and both times he vomited the treat . 
this is the same game as ever ,  just with less graphics . 
my dog loved it but i should have listened to the other negative reviews . 
i got this for my wife num_num years ago . 
i really wanted it to ,  because i want to find something that avoids all the chemicals in regular deodorant . 
i finally needed them took them off the shelve the left hand was cracked . 
i have a deviation to my right foot causing my toes to kind of bend inwards . 
it appears there are just too many fm signals in the air and i get constant interference . 
i was not impressed and will not be buying anymore . 
it was rough on my skin and gave me a burning sensation afterwards . 
i love the idea of no chemicals in my laundry detergent . 
the garter is self hower is very very soft and comfy . 
you can get more froth by blowing bubbles through a straw . 
after hearing how wonderful this is ,  and how to properly use it ,  i decided to try it . 
it worked great when i first got it . 
that is so frustrating because now she is still stuck with the same phone . 
they also look like they would protect well against liquid . 
this router seems to have problems creating connections . 
i called again and they sent me a replacement . 
luckily ,  i didn t pay for it ,  my company did . 
these are definitely not audiophile headphones ,  but then ,  they are earbud style . 
i have one with a qi charging back ,  and one with a wireless charging insert . 
this is not like the tpu gel ,  it s just a horrible quality rubber  recycled tire tube  case from china . 
as it is now ,  i wouldnt even say its worth renting . 
we purchased one of these tents a number of years ago and it is still going strong . 
the music is indeed sweet to listen to . 
needless to say i will be throwing this item away . 
i am in the beginning of num_extend and started to notice all the wrinkles and experimented with different stuff . 
i am very disappointed in hanes right now . 
my poor baby ,  i ve never heard him cry like that before . 
half the colors in here are the same ,  and it is not a very nice quality . 
interesting nowhere in the manual or on the website was there anything about  trouble shooting  . 
it is a neurotoxin that can cause liver damage and kidney problems . 
if it was just a go forward num_extend and stop i d give it five stars . 
the petsafe little dog remote trainer is no different . 
this product was so bad ,  that i had to trow it out . 
i like the fruit punch honest aid flavor much better than this one . 
you won t have that time with this watch . 
after fiddling way too much ,  i finally got my mail and msn messenger to work ,  but not the browser . 
you can rotate the text so it shows the way it should . 
i like the style and fit however the material is what i do not like . 
what i ve noticed is that most other reviewers seem to be avid readers who use their ebookman s everyday . 
i m tossing and going back to oracle tearsplus . 
very awkward to carry anything ,  let alone a full load . 
or i guess i could just give them to my sister . 
the items are made from a quality plastic and will hold up very well over time . 
however ,  i was disappointed when it arrived without a working rattle . 
it wasn t everybody s cup of tea ,  but that s okay . 
the movement of your character is just so frustrating . 
it got stuck and i had to remove the mincing plate . 
most of these lines also handle steaming vegetables as well . 
this device does not work under maverick for osx . 
i charged it as instructed and began use . 
dogs used as a chew toy and destroyed it in a few days . 
it was supposed to record for num_num minutes ,  but it didn t even record for num_num seconds . 
in other rooms ,  i ve had it run for several hours at a time . 
if they were rechargable ,  they would have probably lasted a few hours . 
it s a great thought ,  but doesn t come out right in practice . 
i bought a large pair for large hands . 
i peeled from this stuff it was so bad . 
do not play with more than one other person or you will experience some serious slowdown . 
after about num_num shots the flingshot fell apart . 
i have a stylus like the one this seller sent and this is not why i order this case . 
found on other cables was just a way of justifying a higher price . 
anyone who plays hoshigami is sure to get slaughtered several times in the first few battles . 
this product doesn t really offer much in the way of cleaning carpet messes . 
i have thrown them away .  .  . just to painful to use . 
first day we used it ,  the side arm broke off in my num_num year old s hand . 
we ordered it via an office supply store so couldn t try it out first . 
as soon as you go beyond a couple of feet ,  focusing was impossible . 
on top of that ,  the brushes shed all over my face ,  even though i have barely cleaned them . 
the snack tray is a great idea ,  but isn t a really great placement . 
tried using the other two  both still in original packaging  . 
the first bowl of this had gone bad . 
 not to be indelicate ,  but it gave me wind . 
then you re left with no kickstand . the holster works . 
it is bitter and does not sweeten anything . 
the bracket isn t terrible ,  but it was a waste of money for me . 
i shared with a couple of friends to get their reactions too . 
this is going to be the most time consuming part ,  getting the glue loose enough to come off . 
its a tad bit more ,  but not expensive . 
works as expected and holds a lot of cat litter . 
i wanted these to fit so badly !  unfortunately ,  i couldn t get my foot all the way into the boot . 
my husband bought these because the reviews said they worked just as good as gillette sensor ones . 
pretty small portion but as a snack it s relatively low in calories . 
i carefully read all of the information on the product before purchasing . 
there is a lot of timing and button mashing to defeat hordes of monsters over and over again . 
doesn t do much good if you can t sample it . 
anyway ,  as i was finishing the handle came apart . 
you get to play each one ,  one at a time ,  through the same exact settings with slightly different scenarios . 
this ended up being a hard plastic and not a rubberized material . 
went to buy another and the price had gone back up . 
that is starting to stick up when i wear it . 
i shouldn t have to buy something to read the package !  . 
i have reset the router i have actually changed the router out to no avail . 
i have had cuisinart combo blender and food processor for years . 
in fact ,  it actually looks worse in high def . 
i was far from home and could not wash it off . 
it worked by making him scared of pulling . 
waiting a year for a replacement was even a bigger joke . 
this pan is too shallow to use for anything but eggs . 
i can t afford to constantly drop my phone on the ground . 
well ,  that and you can play with three other friends off one umd . 
it was the most expensive mistake i ve made this year . 
must be the gmo stuff they put in everything now . 
it s an eye sore with the cheap paper on the sides ,  too bright in color . 
never lose a pound ,  just sweat slightly more than normal . 
the manner in which it attaches ,  and the tools needed to attach it are almost impossible . 
as long as you don t play hockey with them ,  or melt them ,  you ll be ok . 
i bought this for my home and did not realize how big it was . 
don t get me wrong ,  this is a quality cot . 
my screen has no options on the left . 
while it works great ,  it is not movable as stated in the listing . 
securom can interfere with the operation of hardware ,  specifically disc num_extend
still love de shaving ,  but my beard is too tough for this razor . 
this thing collects dirt like you wouldn t believe . 
one day later and i have two big puddles on said couch . 
then it s okay until something moves it again . 
the hinge in the middle of the top rubs against the top of my head . 
i ended up buying a breville . i do not recomend . 
it crashes very often and typically ends up with a new ip address . 
all of the pieces give the word miniature and new definition . 
it really didn t even taste as strong as the store brands usually do . 
maybe its because i don t know what i m doing . 
didn t even bother spending the money to return this piece of junk . 
when i placed another companies coffee in ,  it tasted fine . i have num_num boxes if anyone wants them . 
i ve tried countless otc acne kits ,  face washes ,  creams ,  lotions ,  etc and this one was no different . 
 the horizontal is ok .  my $ normal tv worked for num_num years without a problem . 
in my experience these cables were not great . 
but they were not expensive and would cost more headache to send back vs . 
it s not gross and so clearly is appealing to some people . 
byrd mini games were a little better ,  though not much . 
i bought num_num sets of these for my kids to watch videos on a trip . 
i liked the fact that it did not fall off my head while exercising and i liked the sound . 
companies ignore issues until their wallets get hit . 
if my num_num year old would ever play with this toy i m sure it would be educational for him . 
it does not heat up enough for those with thick hair like me . 
until one day the stitching was coming out . 
best wishes on seeing this one make it to a tourney . 
otherwise whats the point in playing the game . 
the good news is that it does work . 
ok if you want to watch a movie . 
but as one reviewer indicated ,  the num_extend will only talk to others of its kind . 
num_num months later it did it again ,  cleaned it again but it would only work when it wanted to . 
i was successful ,  but this severely damaged the threads on the bead  and hopefully not my shotgun  . 
a couple of other things will activate the sound ,  but it s not very much fun . 
and the game has no tutorial or any way to learn what all the little squares and whatnot mean . 
also it has a cheep feel to it ,  like if you squezed it it would break . 
i am throwing mine in a drawer and buying a different one . 
i also want to be taken seriously and sometimes brazen makeup colors can prevent that from happening . 
i tried regular audio cd s and data cd s  with num_extend songs  but it still would not perform . 
it leaves a ugly residue that won t come off until you wash it off . 
it has num_num settings but they really make very little difference in the grind . 
but the correct knife arrived and was a continued quality disappointment . 
the spoiled seed decreases bird traffic at the feeder and also spreads disease . 
once i finally got it working ,  the call quality is very good . 
then i needed one for my child and got this one . 
i will have to modify the feet somehow to fix this issue . 
i wish to  god  i d never heard of god of war . 
plus its too easy to be ripped off . 
heat it in a crock pot or on the stove . 
this toy just stop working after one week of use . 
he wears a num_num if they are sewn true to scale . 
product feels cheat and would probably break easily . 
i feel like it all just poofs off during the day leaving nothing to kill the fleas . 
it s cute on ,  and looks good under a running shirt with the little modesty panel . 
these scissors shouldn t even carry the henckels name ,  its a disgrace to this great brand name . 
third time and they landed in the trash . 
but i d rather stick with good tasting coffee and follow it up with a tums . 
i immediately put these cutting boards in the dishwasher when they arrived . 
if you can stop at num_num or num_extend you should be fine . 
the underwear were too tight on the thighs and too big in the midsection . 
the ball isn t attractive enough and makes no noise to get them interested . 
i won t purchase again since it is too heavy for my hair texture . 
i used to buy num_extend years ago and loved the quality and fit but this one was very different . 
after a short time it stopped twirling unless you made it spin . 
instead ,  the camera s moving all over the place . 
this was a waste of fifteen bucks for something that is going in the garbage . 
i bought these for a friend so yeah this is written in num_extend person . 
in the world of firearms this is an extremely unsafe product . 
the flavor is off and not what i expected . 
would be helpful if terk had specified the connections needed to connect the antenna . 
gave him six tablets  directions said to give four so i went a little over  ,  which he enjoyed eating . 
thankfully we bought it through amazon and just returned it . 
i couldnt even give this stuff away num_num friends + family after they tasted it !  two huge thumbs down . 
i really regret wasting my money on this product . 
you are instantly tossed into chaos before you even know which button shoots . 
i have a sig num_num with a rail ,  so i bought this holster . 
even hardwiring to the unit losses connection frequestly . 
before writing this review ,  i ve decided to throw the rest out . 
i ll just go back to cleaning the yard every time one of them goes out . 
and still the stupid thing kept shifting ,  allowing my foot to drop . 
maybe the shipper dents the cans ,  but the packager i . e . 
have only played like once or twice and don t even know where it is now . 
flimsy and very very cheap !  do not waste your money !  . 
you really need to be thin and lanky for this pair to look good on you . 
well ,  i went to turn on the player .  .  . nothing . 
i tightened it and the connector turned around in the plastic . 
i like giving them a high quality food . 
about num_num months for me .  . do not waste your money !  . 
save yourself some time and don t buy this mouse . 
try at least to sound as good as a $ portable cd player ,  and then i ll be interested . 
this contour pillow is not only smaller then it appears in the image ,  but also has too much give . 
turns out she thought it was worthless also . 
after a few use ,  the mesh starts to break down . 
i was sooo disappointed in this raisin bran cereal . 
looking at the humidifier straight as pictured on this site ,  the air is channeled left and right . 
i find the product a little bit greasy . 
looking at the opening straight on or in its mirror means laser light right in their eyes . 
and what s more if it is the case it s absurd . 
now they are no more softer on my feet than any other pair of slippers . 
after a week of having it ,  it started to peel . 
it s not bad ,  really ,  it s just that there are much better games out there . 
they look like roach motels ,  but for ants . 
it peels right off ,  doesn t harden ,  and isn t even all that glossy unless you put on num_num coats . 
even with all of this ,  i still can t clean every part ,  so the mold is never completely gone . 
i know it did not damage my hair ,  but it exaggerates split ends . 
i tried touching for her ,  but she has little interest in books unless she can hold and mouth them . 
the smell and taste is like burnt something . 
the material is cheap velvet ,  so i will slowly slide down it ocasionally . 
i was shocked ,  because i myself wanted to catch the darn string ,  but not so much my kitty . 
after using this product continously for num_num days ,  i did not see any difference in color of my teeth . 
they have changed the formula and now it stings and turns your face red . 
also ,  it doesn t remove waterproof sunscreen very well . 
we ll see what happens to this one come spring ,  but i m not optimistic and i m disappointed at it s flimsiness . 
it seems to dry out my skin and feels like any cheap soap you buy at the store . 
this drive suffers from repeated delayed write file errors . 
the lightest shade is darker in person and should not be used on pasty white chicks such as myself . 
and not to mention in num_extend u must wait num_extend just to quick load after you die . 
its a fps game ,  not a role playing game . 
the joins are now very sharp shards of plastic ,  and there are wires sticking out . 
the app used to integrate this unit with the phone is motorola my motospeak . 
then i would purchase it again; otherwise ,  no !  !  !  . 
the outer appearance deteriorated by then ,  but it performed to the end . 
my opinion of course but if someone else wants it ,  i will mail it to you . 
one of the earphones reaches at a shorter distance than the other . 
this is a very loosely woven cheesecloth ,  and it s also a long ,  thin strip . 
i called john deere and they essentially told me it was not their problem . 
would like a replacement ,  but for the $ spent on it ,  it s not really worth pursuing . 
i gave it num_num stars because it might just be the best kombucha ever but i will never know . 
the string will not feed ,  after many attemps to make it work ,  i had to give up . 
until one day when i had a tuna lunchable . 
it leaves a strong smell on your face that smells just like swisher sweets cigars . 
then ,  they practice their letters the wrong way . 
i have been having the hardest time finding a charger that actually works for my phone . 
the humidistat says low for room humidity and the power control does not turn it on . 
after all that had happen to get it ,  it was not what i expected . 
if you do ,  then you have the option of stealing your enemies car ,  but only his car . 
avoid buying this item . the latch is rubbish and wouldn t allow the umbrella to be lowered literally the first outing . 
my son is num_num mo ,  yet ,  his legs are not comfy inside ,  they sometimes fall on the sides . 
the total talk time was measured across three separate calls . 
go for the otterbox defender case it has a built in screen protector . 
the carasoul needs battery change very often though we have not used often . 
i had to get my husband to pry them apart . 
of course my warranty has by now expired ,  so i have no choice but to buy a new unit . 
a child could make an incorrect number or letter ,  and it doesn t seem that the leappad would recognize it . 
i called amazon ,  received a full refund and advised them to remove it from their offerings . 
again it worked for about num_num weeks and after that kaput . 
this little worm didn t work well for my special needs son . 
it doesn t change my idea of the headphones . 
too bad ,  because i bet that daily application would prevent streaks and missed spots . 
i had no sickness and i could see the benefits within a week of using it . 
it now makes a grinding noise when it tries to access any floppy disk . 
the first bite seemed okay ,  but i could not finish it even though it was small . 
he also did not seem to realize it was there to pique his interest . 
it was tight in the bra area and much too small in the lower skirt . 
i did notice my thighs really getting a work out . 
it s still working otherwise ,  but what a mess !  . 
we re letting this one die with over num_num units left on it because it is basically useless . 
the fries have no texture and are not filling at all . 
actually they sounded best with the noise cancelling entirely off . 
you must be in great physical hand health to make this puzzle . 
i would try to smooth the holes if i knew how . 
if i had a choice ,  i d get a different product . 
in the picture it looks like a functioning handle on the lid ,  it is not . 
i bought one of these about num_num years back and found it to be a poor product . 
maybe my tiny asian eyelashes are to blame . 
they basically are going to fit like tight earplugs when you finally get them to sound good . 
i am returning these today and will move on from weejuns for now . 
this doesn t happen to be one of them . it has a chalky texture ,  not at all creamy and unsatisfying . 
connection to my galaxy note ii was easy num_extend
these are puffy like those desserts made with rice crispies and marshmallow fluff . 
inside ,  the screen holder assembly is stamped out of cheap material ,  with sharp edges and rough grinding . 
the phrases in the action stages sound stupid from time to time . 
it will peel up the sides of your screen protector . 
this spray could be a body cologne it smells so good . 
i m very dissapointed in the overall product quality . 
i later found that the issue here is that apple does not support the num_extend particular bluetooth profile  avrcp  . 
after a few days i checked each sensor again to be sure each was full of water . 
it even irritates my children . most importantly ,  the bar is very difficult to keep on the leaves . 
bread machines are supposed to make baking bread easier and faster ,  not messier . the zojirushi is fancy for sure . 
this is a really fun part of the game . 
however ,  tensile strength is not how bike chains are attacked . 
you will be surprised how much headphones you get for so little money ,  and forget about sony s cheap stuff . 
be cautioned when buying a  mint condition  phone from this vendor . 
i was absolutely wrong . cleaning these machines is also not as easy as it appears on television . 
this thankfully has not happened before and now i am leary to buy shoes via amazon . 
the blinky light is still there ,  and i still can t play most of my games . 
the tube is completely fine ,  but the valve couldn t hold air . 
a full two inches too long on the inside edge . 
so like all first person shooters before we look for the innovations . 
it smells like something used on an automobile engine . 
it doesn t cost much ,  but even a single dollar is too expensive for something that doesn t work . 
all this thing is ,  is a piece of plastic which has no magical powers at all . 
your enemies are complete idiots and are rather easy to dispatch . 
however ,  i would not recommend buying this new . 
last week ,  the pen mechanism died and will not deploy the pen . 
basically everytime i need the light i would have to turn it on and give it a hard tap . 
nice eye relief . after num_num rounds of num_extend magnum ,  the reticle shifted inside the tube . 
this canteen cup is not the real deal . 
missing the part that hooks to the hose . 
thescent s terrific but i would never buy it for myself . filled with harsh sulfates and other toxins . 
guess what that does to the film ?  creates a series of microcreases that don t come out . 
just remember :  no corn ever and meat should be the first ingredient . 
one reviewer thought that was great; i think it sucks . 
what a waste !  this game is worth num_extend at most . 
so ,  if you need to absorb a lot of liquid ,  use a different underpad . 
this product has no flavor at all ,  very watery consistency . 
as soon as i put these shoes on and walked a bit i knew these were going back . 
amazon . com was wonderful and shipped a new one the same day . 
ironically ,  i had preordered the console version of call of duty long before i had played the pc version . 
i wanted to like this ,  i really did . 
the music is decent ,  there are those same tunes that flavored kill bill vol . 
num_num out of the num_num have now failed as others have mentioned in their reviews . 
i was looking for soft and supple but got hard and dry instead . 
every answering machine will let you plug the phone into it to take a call . 
sony s canards are based on two fundamental errors . 
however ,  these gloves are just too poorly constructed to buy again . 
while i would probably purchase the other flavors of switch ,  i definitely would not purchase this one . 
the camera is often stuck behind thingsthis game is hard . 
just after first use ,  there are dark patches and dark spots on my nose and forehead . 
the blackhawk branding is missing and the design is similar but not the same . 
i have used others for a year with no failures . 
i promptly returned it and got a full refund and moved to the iphone . 
this did not work for me at all . 
i could get the band fastened ,  but trying to wedge my breasts in there ?  never happened . 
in looking at the reviews ,  other people experienced this same problem . 
battery life is good so i gave it num_num stars instead of one . 
after misplacing my original ,  i bought this item which looks the same . 
i m really hoping i m within the time limit to return this item . 
these rounded tips mangle delicate seafood and veggies . 
the enemy ai is amazingly accurate even at distance . 
when i tried the jacket on ,  i was suprised at how small it was . 
so if you are expecting or needing num_num feet ,  you wont get it with this product . 
i own other calphalon cookware and have found it to be of excellent quality . 
this card was purchased because i had a coupon making this what i thought was a very good deal . 
when i installed them had to be super careful so i wouldn t get any air bubbles . 
tomb raider :  legends ,  that had lots of puzzles ,  that was an awesome game . 
sounds too good to be true ,  right ?  well ,  apparently it is . 
the kickstand is awkwardly placed and it doesn t feel very comfortable when holding it . 
after an hour of trying all the tricks to get it to work i decided to return it . 
i will say the red version is nice and i bought it in a store for my husband . 
i read the reviews and thought :  how bad can this be ?  well here we num_extend
the first day i open the stupid pencil ,  the lead just falls out ,  broken . 
these screen protectors reduced the clarity of the screen considerably . 
i chalked it up to vista not playing well with it and put it on my shelf . 
where to start ?  i still consider num_extend to be one of the best games i ve ever played . 
you re much better off with a more expensive alternative . 
so if it says num_extend  :  unable to create device . 
i am cancelling  already cancelled all future  subscribe and save items because fufillment is a joke . 
i was swayed by so many good reviews and wanted the kit containing so many colors . 
if i put it on by itself ,  it doesn t seem to be very moisturizing . 
i took some fabric no sew glue to the ends of the seams to stop the splitting . 
however with the guage up top this pump is extremely top heavy ,  particularly when given its narrow base . 
this device does not seem to penetrate walls well at all . 
you need a single lens doggle that is still very durable ,  sturdily built ,  and not too bulky . 
this product offering is not an effective dose as noted by one other reviewer . 
the slightest movement of air near the headset causes audio to drop out completely . 
on march num_num the item simply fell apart  clip detached from case  . 
i so wanted to love this bra ,  but back it went . 
on first glance this bread looks great ,  but tastewise is a whole different story . 
i thought i was buying quality when i bought this pot ,  but obviously not . 
i would have preferred a vivid color instead . 
i read that if a certain element is removed from stevia that you won t get the bitter aftertaste . 
luckily it was a gift ,  so i didn t waste any money on it . 
the boot are sewn with thread of a different color ,  and the stitching shows in places that are undesirable . 
does not help the breath even with teeth cleaning . 
it was a rather lengthy list for a burt s bees product . i wouldn t buy this body wash again . 
within the course of num_num year ,  i would claim at least couple replacement in each of my phones . 
i have never figured out how to get the pump out to service it or clean it . 
in the temps above num_extend it seems to do ok . 
then please ,  buy this ,  because that is all you are going to get . 
it was so repetitive ,  the same thing over and num_extend
this has some kind of milky like coating on it . 
i even tried a second remote from best buy .  .  . no luck . 
i read the reviews and knew this going in . 
what i mean by that is you basically have a guided path to follow on each level . 
so i bought this popper . unfortunately ,  all the points brought up in the negative reviews are num_extend
i have owned this machine for two years . 
i tested this unit against num_num other headsets and it had the worst sound quality ,  by far . 
however ,  i m so upset how i found ants inside the container the other day . 
it did half a ring around my waist and then broke open . 
only pushing down the red smiley face on the right corner makes the music go . 
i couldn t get past the horrible perfume smell . 
i feel the the sfx are overly used ,  but that s just me . now for the biggie ,  the fun factor . 
i figure we re easier on vacuums than most . 
i primarily use hair spray around the roots to add body and to hold the baby hairs in place . 
according to the package ,  this is % natural coconut water . 
this game is more fun than having a bag of hammers dropped on your head ,  but not by much . 
after what seemed like forever i moved onto the next scene . 
my clawed maine coon shredded through his in days ,  just by jumping up on it and walking across it . 
my dentist suggested i don t  brush  but just move the ultreo over my teeth and gums . 
next time i order ballroom dance shoes i will try a double w width . 
i bought this based on the claim that it helps to prevent bumps ,  irritation ,  and ingrown hairs . 
all i have to say is ,  buyer be ware !  !  !  . 
it s hard to write a very elaborate cookie review . 
each person told me to return this jawbone immediately . 
got through again ,  another tech explained they d had so many problems they discontinued it . 
love the smell of these products but i just don t get the fuss . 
i am not sure which device is giving me problems but i would bet it is the itouch . 
a friend used the olay as instructed ,  ,  ,  ,  but concentrating the  serum  where mentioned . 
i will have to grind away some material to make it fit . 
kids want to learn how things work ,  and this toy provides some teachable moments . 
i must say that i m very disappointed in this game . 
you also need to install the configuration software . 
i will continue to try them out until they are gone ,  but i doubt i ll buy again . 
i realize this is harsh ,  but this product is really num_extend
that is ,  they didn t work in any mode . 
i tried to show this in a picture i posted . 
first ,  you start out being  trained  as an adventurer . 
i realized that the motors weren t running when it was connected to the solar panel . 
for anyone like me who is concerned about comediogenic ingredients acnomel is better . 
for me personally ,  i had a hard time adjusting to the new look and feel . 
i was equally thrilled to see all the num_num star review on here . 
once they ve all been picked up ,  mom has to unscrew the trunk and get the thing going again . 
the attachment point looks to be cast metal . 
i said it didn t bother me ,  so i didn t ask for a new one . 
if you were planning on silencing a call .  .  . forget it . 
it gets caught on hair and painfully rips it out . 
the only reason this gets more than the minimal one star is due to my daughter s enthusiasm for it . 
the mqx is larger and more delicate ,  but not as delicate as this one . 
i have also found that num_num hasn t addressed the problem of qbs with speed being able to dominate . 
i m currently trying iforce nutrition hemavol and getting great results :  awesome pumps and great endurance . 
now its to the point i must unplug the unit to turn it off . 
this is a cheap imitation that frays when cutting . 
i never could use this product because it felt like sandpaper around my eyes . 
i charged them both to % and when they were unplugged them immediately went down to %
i purchased this probe thermometer because i started getting into real barbecuing ,  i mean meat smoking . 
they are terrible and a complete waste of money . 
i use this product to separate my long layers to give my hair movement . 
the spices in the plastic bottles were aged and turning brown . 
i expected a much better flavor considering it was hormel . 
going to have to make time and cook myself more . 
i would give it a one star except we really like the first one for the first two years . 
added more filler to allow this review to be posted . 
i ve read that you can change the controls to using the thumbstick ,  but that s just boring . 
tigger is my num_num year female that has had high anxiety as long as i could remember . 
the best price i saw was num_num packages for num_num cents on sale at a local grocery store . 
we typically have to remove the train from the tracks to do it . 
i returned the item and purchased another brand . 
i bought it for myself ,  but i m making my husband finish it . 
it has a really strong smell that was objectionable to me . 
it was also very difficult to plug the adapter into the transmitter . 
additionally ,  the mute function did not work consistently for me . 
i knew for the price the quality wouldn t be that great ,  but i wanted it for the beach ,  etc . 
just be careful and watch each primer carefully . 
i guess you get what you pay for as i find this tea nothing like panera . 
it s as if someone cut the spatula out of an old coke can . 
at the end ,  it works perfectly but it seems it was used already . 
these are probably sensible but taste awful ,  you can t even tell which fruit you are eating ,  yuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk . 
i won t buy this game unless it s .  .  . on sale forget about this !  . 
my advise would be to by a separate solid brass hammer and a separate polymer hammer . 
the rulers  that go at the top and bottom of each side  were bowed inward and very flimsy . 
let s face it ,  ea makes their sports characters look more cartoonish than realistic . 
i was constantly adjust the bag and the shoulder strap but could never find a comfortable fit . 
it does not charge my device well at all . 
my family didn t really care for these cookies . 
my daughter has several furreal friend toys and those she loves . 
what i look for in a case num_extend
she broke this clip open  while it was  locked   within num_num minutes of running back and forth playing outside . 
i saw this store have it for num_num bucks with a torn label and cartridge only . 
i bought this when i bought the pop maker . 
you get what you pay for .  .  . in this case num_num weeks after you order it . 
these shoes did not fit the same as other clark s num_extend
what put me off on this item is the way the ports are configured . 
it should say  only campatible with the linksys instant wireless network pc card num_extend
it s very unpleasant on a bedroom closet in the late hours . assembly is a pain . 
for me  ,  chars were at lvl num_extend
i got this for free and used it for a couple years before i found something better . 
i often have difficulty envisioning the size and details on amazon . 
would i buy some of this coffee anyway because its acid free ?  no . 
this is without a doubt the worst quality shirt i ve ever seen . 
i think the larger version of this may work better from what i ve read . 
if you don t live at the base of the radio antenna ,  don t buy this item . 
second biggest issue is that num_extend on virgin mobile is very congested . 
considering that monsters don t re spawn and you can t backtrack as much . 
first of all ,  the box was tattered and beaten up ,  and second of all ,  the product is horrible . 
i run a daycare and we are trying to reduce environmental toxins  including plastic  . 
i m going to ask for a replacement unit and hopefully the second unit doesn t stink as bad . 
i ve seen no improvements when taking this at all . 
time to reiterate :  the face on this watch is num_extend
there is minimal clearance when you are wearing the device . 
it s like they looked in an la phone book to get names for the spanish lieutenants . 
i had made a pot of coffee which was on the warming plate . 
there are several blank stickers where you can draw your own chores ,  which i found very helpful . 
well ,  the heating element on my waring pro num_extend broke after a little over num_num years . 
changing angles requires more than one button push . my apex cost half as much and has many more features . 
the material and construction of this item is good ,  but . 
the door of this bug barn is flimsy and broke immediately upon getting it out of the shipping box . 
then ,  about num_num years ago ,  several manufacturers ,  energizer included ,  came up with a portable battery charger . 
its like a mixture of madden num_num and num_num broken to parts . 
loose enough for me to get both of my legs in one pant leg . 
was still too thick to get in the small groove . 
i expected picture quality from the num_num to be at least as good as my old pal sony num_extend
there s a little featurette that compares the graphics of several versions  including the laserdisc and dvd versions  . 
i am hoping that the next hp camera we review will better meet my expectations of quality hp products . 
i have been using this cream since june . 
i don t know what i was thinking buying such a cheap shirt . 
it s also noisier than the old one and looks worse . 
i knew it was a plain design but after seeing it in person ,  i returned it . 
no matter what . cheaply made and quality on them is so bad that i felt embarrassed giving them out . 
well ,  in the end i found this to be a disappointing product . 
i was patient for the first num_num minutes of this but i m not a saint and finally stopped her . 
works great for volume and the  shampoo  aspect . 
nothing you can do with these they are sticky too and very thin . 
but the part that i didn t like was how extremely thin they are . 
you have to break it down and put it together again each time you play . no thanks . 
for those wanting the obscene amounts of airflow i suggest a larger fan that spins slower . 
i had hopes of eliminating all soda and using this drink on hikes ,  workouts ,  etc . 
the red is a flimsy red cloth that is on the edges . 
num_extend just like num_extend has the exact set of features i ever needed . 
it only gave me headache . i connected this switch to desktop and laptop . 
as a num_extend i didn t need padding ,  just wanted a lift . 
this would be a wonderful and handy little product if it worked ,  but it does not . 
my daughter has me putting it back together every couple of minutes . 
spent way too much time trying to put this is the magic spot so that i could see . 
gmr reviewed the game and only gave it a num_num out of num_extend
while not a true coffee connoisseur like others ,  i found this coffee just ok . 
the tint made my skin look flaky and clumped dead skin together . 
i really wanted this to work ,  and hoped to stop using antiperspirants ,  but i just can t . 
oh well . a few days later when i have eaten all the products in package . 
a credit card didn t even slide all the way down into the case . 
i ordered the variety packs but instead received just chocolate and vanilla . 
i m looking into the pelican code breaker mentioned by one of the other reviewers . 
i had a poor experience with sennheiser as a company . 
considering all the cons ,  this item is definitely overpriced . 
overall ,  i would not buy this at all for anyone . 
purchased this blow dryer when it first came out for way more than they are selling it now . 
so what if it looks pretty ?  it plays like crap . 
so ,  i will be in the middle of something online then i am not online anymore . 
all i have heard are good things about this game but that is not what i thought . 
when i received the filter in its box i thought the item was missing . 
disappointed . i think it might have been old with a dead battery . 
to remedy this ,  i squeeze it around in the tube before i squeeze it out . 
i have never had to order something in petite before ,  but i might just have to . 
for $ i bought this ,  took it home and had hope for about num_num minutes . 
i initially used this for trap shooting and it was working ok . 
the seller was great tthe only reason i gave this any stars really .  . the toy not so much . 
i honestly have no idea what it is about . 
perhaps i read this wrong ,  but this does not fit the leap reader . 
i was very disappointed when my vanity fair nightie arrived . 
i decided to purchase this harness to walk my two young dogs ,  one of which pulls a lot . 
otherwise ,  once again ,  terrible for a num_num release . 
if you lookat my other reviews i ve nothing but praise for almost every item i buy through amazon . 
only had it a short time and all the seams are ripping and the head is coming off . 
it has a lot of bells and whistles and appears to be a quality radio . 
i guess they tried to save costs by just using square bar stock . 
do not get this joke of a bike aid item . 
i also hate to say ,  based on what i saw ,  i will not purchase anything audio from them again . 
its not too over priced ,  i think i bought it for $
now they can be inserted but they fall right out . 
i came in at ii ,  loved iii and thought there were some good improvements with iv .  .  .  . and then came v . 
however the quality of this product is way worse   even though is much more expensive  . 
it is very hard to review a product such as this one . 
this product is nothing but a piece of junk . 
this was extremely harsh and actually made my acne worse . 
in each level you re assinged different tasks to complete . 
it splashed everywhere and made a mess to be cleaned num_extend the tea tasted strongly of plastic . 
naturally ,  alphasmart only has technical support available on weekdays . 
too expensive to barely smell at all and nothing at all outstanding about it . 
i received this item today ,  luckily i bought it for $ or so ,  and still have my prime trial . 
it does not want to come all the way out to hold the spring up in place . 
like many other customers i purchased this vacuum because it received a good rating from consumer reports . 
in other words the sum of the parts does not equal the whole . 
i spend all day tugging at the neck line ,  trying to stretch it out so i can breathe . 
if we can be of further assistance in thefuture ,  please let us know . 
we played this game one time ,  and have yet to play it again . 
i really don t know what to think of this foundation . 
didn t fit  too tight  ,  and the shoe itself was too big . 
i ordered one of this tea balls about num_num months ago and quality of product was perfect . 
i bought this adapter  by the same company that makes the touch pad  to plug into my usb port . 
you will have to drink warm tea like parsely to remove this product from your body . 
none of my four cats will touch food that has this sprinkled on or stirred in it . 
some purchases worked out to be useful and others turned out to be a total waste of money . 
the top was ok ,  but the sides and bottom were garbage . yes ,  i followed the directions provided . 
i grew to detest this product after having to use it for a few hours in black fly season . 
i am currently using the front from a much cheaper product purchased elsewhere . 
really wished they would just find a way to send it since it looked like a cute case . 
virtually all of the monsters in the game are push overs . 
i bought this to protect my new panasonic lumix num_extend lens . 
guess i learned not to buy reconditioned or from smart bargains !  . 
we ultimately have no control over our fertility ,  god does . 
i fails to release the actual tape portion of the cassette on eject ,  shredding the tape . 
it just stopped brewing right in the middle of a pot of coffee . 
the general materials other than the rivet seem to be okay  acceptable for a child s bicycle  . 
and i used it as i was told  not too liberally  . 
the ultimate press dip stand arrived one day late . 
maybe i ll get a worthwhile game instead ,  or maybe i ll just sit around and watch the grass grow . 
surthrival is also a good brand ,  just not symbiotics . 
a week after use ,  it stopped supporting the weight of my samsung galaxy sii . 
i really don t think these are worth the money . 
the belkin transmitter works in that i can assign a station and hear playback from my muvo . 
it has an unpleasantly bitter aftertaste and grainy texture . 
not to mention that the man will be numb for the next hour or two . 
not someting i would expect from an led . 
wouldn t even allow me to send it back . 
do your research before investing in this low cost grooming system . 
granted ,  most decaf doesn t taste very good ,  especially the instant varieties . 
i bought this to use as a nursing bra since nursing bras have such poor support . 
i broke the lettuce in half to make smaller pieces . 
there are other toys out there that they like way better . 
great size but the edges cause an issue . 
i know girls usually are the ones to use stamps but boys like craft projects too . 
for this purpose ,  i d give it three stars . averaging across these two different uses ,  two stars . 
i bought these thinking they would help put on my make up easier . 
this does not taste like pomegranate ,  it tastes like sick bubble gum . 
intense mintiness and i had a slight burning that did eventually subside . 
levi is not what it used to be ,  as far as quality . 
rent it for num_num bucks and then buy it on ebay or here for num_num bucks . 
kitchenaides used on a regular basis to make homemade bread  especially using whole wheat flour  will destroy your motor . 
could be amazon ,  or could be firefox issue . 
didn t seem to hold a charge any better than the original .  .  . wouldn t bother wasting your time . 
it is num_extend binocular you send me with damage or defective . 
i purchased this swedish fire steel num_extend strike model   along with magnesium fire starter bars . 
the soup turned out to be very runny and not as thick as it should . 
having seen comparison photos in other reviews of this product i decided to test . 
any support unless it after a operation does not fix a thing . 
it is not the same game anymore ,  it is completely different . 
we used this for years but the fleas in this area no longer are affected by it . 
it s not that it s a bad company ,  or bad product per se . 
first ,  the case is near impossible to remove . 
i tried breaking it when the kids were asleep .

we tried the dark chocolate ,  gluten free and sugar free . 
needed a desert out of time and flour . i can see this pan doing very good for angle food . 
things have definitely gone downhill from there ,  and xiii wasn t worth the plastic it was printed on . 
i m a big boy ,  num_extend should have covered me with some room . 
get a nes and have a game that will be waayyy better thatll last num_extend years . 
when used indoors ,  it is vulnerable to rf interference num_extend
i am using up this pack ,  and then never getting it again . 
my hair is thick and bleached so i m not sure if that made it work different or not . 
some licorice you can hold between your fingers and pop into your mouth . 
the fighting gameplay ,  even a five year old can do it because all you do is press a . 
the white fit perfectly and the lattie fit like a size num_extend

do your research and know what you are buying . 
after you find them you just drop them because they are no longer needed . 
i can t seem to figure out what i m missing . 
however ,  one thing that is new this year is the hyped freestyle control . 
as a long time rodent owner  rescuer num_num yrs plus  ,  this is the worst wheel ever . 
turning it into story lacking adventure seems such a waste . 
but i am seriously wondering if i can make it that long . 
they had free support until just very recently . 
broke with her pulling on it with her feet . 
i ve used the gentle leader for years on multiple dogs because nothing else has worked very well . 
when i got the next order num_num more of the bowls were broken . 
this ball is not for dogs that like to chew . 
also i was looking forward for the easytone running shoes . 
i returned the item for a slim fit ,  because this was baggy on the legs and rear . 
the old school  shove others out of the way ,  my car s invincible  gag . maybe it s just me . 
i must say it heats up nicely ,  but i hate cleaning it . 
the voice actors hired sounds like they are reading from a script and nothing more . 
it tastes like there are ingredients in it that do not exist in my kitchen . 
when done badly ,  as in this case ,  it just becomes irritating to the point of distraction . 
not to forget ,  the night before christmas ,  my husband had a heck of a time putting this together . 
looks the same but does not perform the same as when i buy it from the vet . 
all num_num are num_num inches only !  !  ! one of the pictures has num_num different knives ,  num_num different sizes . 
dont even bother to illegally download it for free or go to the trouble of even thinking of it . 
i don t think i could have applied it any more professionally . 
these are a bit too fragile for those who rush around in the kitchen or have teens . 
i bought this grinder because of all the hype i read about burr grinders . 
get some nuts and reusable ziploc bags ,  make your own ,  and it ll be much cheaper . 
the bad news is when taking these tires off the wire bead seperated from the rubber ruining the tire . 
one they do not get nearly as loud as the pair that came with my desktop . 
i love chocolate and i have sugar cravings . 
maybe our track is the only one with issues . 
i have called tech support three times  long distance call num_num area code  and exchanged multiple emails without resolution . 
this was on sale at a bargain store ,  so i thought i d give it a shot . 
lastly ,  the flimsy spring seems to be loosening and the horn part is ready to fall off . 
should have read he reviews ,  would have not bought it . 
there is a similar one at the bullseye store that is much nicer and the same price . 
something that zero could get . the music is okay at times but get s annoying . 
the only thing that kept me going was the story . 
i ordered down a size just to make sure it held it all in ,  but nope . 
i expect a few things of a receiver :  sound ,  ease of use ,  with style a low num_extend
it was just simply not enough coverage to help even out my skin tone . 
i wanted something without the petroleum and more natural and just totally wasted my money . 
sorry ,  but that s nowhere near acceptable for a cable of this price  even though the price was good  . 
also this stuff goes on great with my concealer brush . 
it s just a string poorly glued on to a mouse shape . 
i have recharable batteries for my digital camera that have been going strong for more than three years now . 
this looked and smelled like human food ,  but the cats won t touch it . 
only to find that the num_extend has the same problem but not as bad . 
the charging port should not be obstructed when the device is installed on a sunvisornot num_extend
cheap plastic ,  did not fit my phone as advertised .

these binoculars are very good in image quality ,  fit and finish . 
the cards don t fit in all the slots . 
i bought these looking for something that would dry quickly after a quick wash in the sink .

at it s core you get num_num mg vitamin c . 
either way red bull and any other energy drink keep me alive much better than these chumps .

i had a res aquatic turtle before and the proper uv bulbs were costly . 
she never has been outside and now she is clawing at the door to get out . 
i did not enjoy the controls on this game . 
i had to return and the shipping and handling was really high . 
it also goes on unevenly; and ,  despite many attempts ,  i m unable to correct this . 
this was num_num per cent through the level . 
as much as i shop on amazon ,  this is disappointing . 
also the material is slightly scratchy and uncomfortable . 
this sequel has that element also ,  but has two glaring flaws . 
however ,  when the package arrived ,  the handle was broken clean off where it met the jug . 
now i didn t wear it everyday ,  but every time i did ,  i heard about it . 
so i do not subject buying this product . 
in my case ,  it was totally unnecessary and a waste of money . 
even if it meant that my husband teased me mercilessly for days about the purchase . 
make sure you order a minimum of one but more like two sizes larger to get a reasonable fit . 
this is my review after about num_extend years of num_extend
the menu is tedious and cumbersome to work with . 
if you just want to decorate the inside of your shoes .  .  . then this is the purchase for you . 
she still haven t been able to use her phone yet . 
i received a trial version of oscar blandi pronto invisible volumizing dry shampoo spray . 
it provides num_extend open circuit ,  dropping to num_extend v at num_extend and dropping further to num_extend at num_extend
your clothes will smell like burnt fruit dipped in nail polish remover . 
instead you have to call them and if it ain t broke ,  as was my case ,  your keeping it . 
i used up the entire jar ,  which did not take very long ,  but i would not purchase it again . 
there are few things in this world that make me weep openly . 
make sure you order up a cup and bands size . 
in good spirits otherwise ,  but potty time was disgusting . 
both the system and controllers run on batteries ,  unless you purchase an ac adapter separately . it comes down to this . 
this stuff is super thick and in a bad way . 
hopefully ,  it will last for at least a month . 
the rubber holder is a little flimsy and not very durable . 
i wasn t too thrilled with how it looked on my phone .  .  .  .  . perhaps white would have looked better . 
the placing of the tubes however is poor . 
would go with a plastic one over a metal one if you want kids to play with . 
the ad and the box say num_num bottle rack . 
the skin case is bigger that my cell phone so i loose the case all the time . 
the timing knob is difficult to grasp and turn . 
the teammate ai is horrible and doesn t help at all . 
and i will say the quality wasn t really all that great . 
few month after of using ,  it started getting rusty . 
i don t wear them ,  nor do i care if they keep color or look pretty . 
they in fact show tiny lines running up and down the screen when you view it through the protector . 
homeopathy does not and cannot work ,  except via the placebo effect . 
i have tanks with this product and without this product . 
was getting over num_extend sustained and never a lock up with even the cheapest linksys switch . 
i will never buy gold from amazon again its the only time i have been disappointed by amazon . 
this happen in num_num when the so called  crash of video games of num_extend accured . 
the dirt devil bags are constructed better and were easier to find . 
although that tire only needs a relatively low num_num psi of pressure ,  the patches simply would not stay adhered . 
i bought the lcd charger along with these batteries . 
the inside liner partitioner is already torn at the bottom and quality is very poor . 
not sure if i want to take a chance on anything more expensive or not . 
these were inexpensive thank god because my cats totally ignored them . 
according to the google cache display ,  the site has been down all month . 
i am still looking for the perfect spatula  !  . 
but now for the second year in a row ,  it s not even the best football game . 
i contacted linksys for num_num hours hoping that they could figure it out but no . 
the material is very thin and it does not look like the photo . 
they do play with the toy that is suggested to use with the treats ,  but just as a ball . 
i was on the hunt for a face lotion that had atleast spf num_num and had light coverage . 
the only part that s well made is the gray inner liner !  don t buy !  . 
nice that it slides on better than certain other products but the product is just too loose . 
it does not recognize this as a samsung product and will not charge on it . 
it made it look less pleasing to the eye as it was no longer a polka dot case . 
i don t know what the problem is ,  possibly the digital downloads are some how protected . 
she is warm now and no one mocks me for the mismatch . it really is a very warm cap . 
finally and more importantly ,  the mouse burns a set of aa batteries about every num_num days . 
if i could give this thing  zero  stars i would . 
the little latch that is supposed to hold the umbrella open will not keep it open . 
the edge is very sharp ,  so it makes the glasses very uncomfortable to wear . 
whoever plays this game and enjoys it is an absolute idiot . 
if you want a high quality made in u . s . a . 
the first time i used it was when i was gardening . 
this was odd to me because it was right at the top left edge . 
a lot of the music is tinny and hardly sounds like the movie . 
i know that smell  and taste ,  yes ,  i tasted it  . 
there are many better jrpgs for xbox num_num out there . 
inclines in the road seemed to cause the player even more problems . 
did not work for me since i wanted one with moist heat .  .  .  . not just hot . 
the hum only occurred while the audio input was attached to computer  mac pro  . 
even worse ,  i probably used the thing twice a month . 
i figured i would try the hoover that was about $ less . 
this came highly recommended ,  but i am not getting relief with a torn rotator cuff . 
the game is linear and i don t just mean the storyline . 
the lid must have been  sprung  because it didn t want to close . 
running around seems hard and i think the plot is just about the worst for any game ever made . 
the cups were larger than expected ,  and the padding wouldnt stay in place . 
the people are definitely not helpful if you want to return it . 
i purchased num_num of this item thinking that it was a great idea to get medications organized . 
very high maintenance wok !  heats up only at the bottom . 
the kids are quickly disappointed or bored by the fact that an adult has to do all the work . 
however the cable i received has solid conductors making it overpriced and unsuitable for use as a patch cable . 
reception was bad ,  sound volume was low ,  and overall quality was simply not that good . 
i thought coming from kong it would hold up better ,  she had it shredded in num_num minutes . 
the result ,  gothic num_num ran like a yugo on one good cylinder  a sign of poor coding  . 
couldn t figure out how to say it in one line ,  but if you buy this ,  it will work . 
if it weren t such a pain for me i d send it back either for a refund or replacement . 
truthfully ,  i m obsessed with strategy rpgs ,  and i m always eager to devour new ones  which are rare ,  you see  . 
but if that s what you re into ,  you ll love the soap . 
on the num_extend week the battery died completely and failed to hold a charge consistently . 
i ordered these to help size down a ring i received that was a size to big . 
i m no expert sewer but i managed to add to the straps and make them longer . 
i got the metal handle with the plastic connectors . 
the second one a few months and the third one less than a month . 
it would be great in theory if it actually paired with my phones ,  as mentioned in the description . 
the brush end is far to flimsy and the rest is far to ridged . 
i present this review as a warning to others so that they can avoid this painful experience . 
it s not really appropriate to wear for anything else because it basically looks like you aren t wearing a bra . 
i gave it two stars since it is wasabi flavor ,  and it certainly tastes like that . 
one of my dogs is obsessive about eating his poop and the other dogs poop . 
what in the world ?  the drm ruins the game . 
there is nothing between your foot and the num_extend
suction lasts about a day before it gives out . 
there s a trigger zone that creates new ones every time you enter it . 
i thought i was getting a tweezers system to remove hair but it was pads that kind of hurt . 
maybe my knee is just too far gone . 
the fiber content cannot possibly negate the effect of that much sugar intake . 
i imagine these would taste great if they were fresh !  !  . 
change your gamertag ?  that will be $ more please . 
i bought this because my original charger cable broke . 
my unit fell and broke the face plate . 
it s a good product ,  and i use it in smoothies ,  but i won t be buying it from amazon again . 
sure enough ,  they were fully charged but reinstalling them didn t help . 
it didn t pop up right away when it was knocked over either . 
the screen protector does not cover my whole front view of my phone . 
called amazon wireless and they couldn t replace it because the x and num_extend are now discontinued . 
one of the defining elements of the breath of fire series is ryu s ability to transform into a dragon . 
the flavor of the tropical splash was weird ,  and left a funny aftertaste . 
not sure how it s supposed to protect anything . 
otherwise ,  it opens and lets liquid splash out during the  mixing .  this has been worthless for my purposes . 
it moves slightly ,  but for the most part ,  is jammed . 
the picture illustrates a color that is a bit lighter than navy . 
ubisoft incorporated the copy protection software knows as tages into xiii . 
spend the money on a much better brand ,  it will be worth it . 
these are simply generically cut and i had to do almost all other cutting myself . 
they do not fit on my jabra era . 
sure ,  it is made in japan ,  but not even that can save it !  you ve been warned !  . 
this is a well constructed pack with nice belt and shoulder strap ,  but it didn t work for me . 
cats need to eat meat ,  and there just isn t real meat in this food . 
they also asked i report back to let them know what natural balance says to me . 
i ll upload a picture when i get the chance ,  it looked like dirt . 
maybe the local computer store guy can hook it up for someone and make them happy . 
i m just shy of num_extend and have broad shoulders so i thought i d take a chance . 
after installing the screen i determined it was low quality . 
they disrupt the flow of the action to the point where i just don t enjoy this game . 
i m sure someone who loves  drifting  and arcade style racing games will like this ,  maybe . 
the smell started to go away . smelled the adapter . 
the manufacturer made no effort at all to round corners . 
the rubber on the tips won t grab and pinch . 
i couldn t even tell if i actually won the battles or if i lost them . 
i tried this shampoo and have to say that i saw none of the results promised . 
it makes a good attempt at creating the pineapple rings that you see come out of the can . 
these headphones work as they re supposed to ,  but the fit is so poor it s weird . 
the music is very annoying ,  and the button needs to be pressed pretty hard for the balls to pop . 
made out of very poor material and does not look like the photo . 
works just fine but no longer in use . 
i need a bigger sized wallet to fit cards and coins as well . 
what is up with that ? you spend far too much time in this game staring at loading screens . 
so she should get a num_extend or an xbox num_extend
it s worst than even the worst rf transmitter i ve ever tried . 
although i do finish the bottle as quickly as possible just to sure . 
i have been having bad luck with certain casio watches . 
the carafe on this unit is a big disappointment . 
i want real  quiet .   you may want to check into fans with the shark fins on the blades . 
eggs fit fine on a mcgriddle ,  when you use the same ring to make the pancake . 
i thought it was because of the signal . 
i ve had lots of wrens ,  and a cardinal  maybe two ,  i m not sure  ,  and some sparrows . 
when i received ,  i found a broken hole on this brand new shirt . 
the popcorn kernels are tough ,  chewy and lack any great corn taste . 
dead rising finds you in the shoes of a reporter investigating a quarantined town in colorado . 
unless you want a clock and thermometer on your bike ,  skip this product . 
bluetooth pieces are falling off the market like flies off a baker s apron . 
i get lukewarm brew now ,  so when i add cream ,  my cup of coffee is cold . 
it does last a very long time but what s the use . 
surprisingly the darker colors of this hat fits fine ,  but the lighter colors don t . 
i bought this for my girlfriend because it was pink . 
the middle part is so thin that my dog s teeth just pierced right though it . 
i had it for num_num days before it ran out or very low . 
they set only comes with i think num_num or so clips so you will need to buy more . 
the ginger also came in small cubes and they should call it candied ginger . 
i would suggest saving your money and making your own bacardi rum cake . 
this effectively means that if the character you re controlling dies ,  the battle s over . 
i should have looked at the letters in detail before buying this . 
my num_num year old must have thought this was something different . 
i was dissapointed to find that there are no markings for the liquid filling . 
sent them back and the seller quickly refunded . 
this means that an uneven surface ,  or a slight breeze could topple the unit over . 
i could never get my router to open up correctly to outside traffic . 
the handle is ok ,  but the mesh is very thin and tears right away . 
i got a slight headache after trying it a few times . 
there are multiple pieces but no case to store all those pieces . 
nice quilted texture but it slides like crazy but i expected that . 
shortly after one hour ,  however ,  the output dropped dead . 
when this set arrived i was highly disappointed because it s alot smaller then what s in the picture . 
i had to return them the next day . 
the instructions are written in space alien language ,  and we have been pounding away at the thing all day . 
take control of harry potter and roam the halls of hogwarts . 
if you re just going to navigate everything with your finger alone ,  these may work for you . 
i see some people love this screen protector and others totally hate it . 
personally ,  this is the worst tanning lotion ive ever used . 
when you  naturally  press the little button straight  in  it doesn t work . 
not sure what it did here or what it claimed to do . 
i called the nearest zojirushi dealership in new york and asked about a replacement pan . 
it is a medium to full coverage foundation ,  so i expected it to cover up the orange completely . 
sound is pretty loud ,  but the other side cannot hear you clearly . 
and yeah ,  i know ,  we re not reviewing prices . 
i went home for a visit to see the parents and sisters . 
despite their lovely motto claiming endless service they were not willing to stand behind this bluetooth earpiece . 
okay before you say i have no life you should rent it and see how easy it is . 
i wanted to see how much air was coming out so i attempted to remove the air line . 
my landlord would certainly dig deep into my deposit if i drilled holes into anything ! sent it back . 
i would def buy this item again ,  providing i can figure out what the correct size would be !  . 
the first thing i do whenever i get any pet treats is checkout the back of the bag . 
i read many people post that their dog got diarrhea with the chews . 
it arrived in a box weighing little so i thought that was a plus . 
i will try another kind next time and will not buy this one again . 
today ,  i noticed that my laptop was hot . 
these came stock on my jackson kelly kexmg . 
i bought this product in the hopes it could help . 
but it won t matter if you get better at the game . this is a game unworthy of the xbox . 
it s a shame ,  too ,  as i prefer the whole nail designs over the smaller designs . 
finally ,  you bring up some of the strange foamy stuff and put it in your mouth . 
well ,  i tell you what ,  this is not the way to go . 
if anyone does ,  please let me know by leaving a comment or messaging me . 
i bought this based on the great reviews that it won t leave streaks but it does . 
most of the tracks you race on  about % are very boring and uninspired . 
the product works ,  just was not right for me . 
i did not receive crushed shell powder i received glitter and not much might i add . 
i was charging my phone in the car ,  but this product only charged my phone to % from %
hard to describe it exactly but first impression was somewhat fishy but in a strange mulchy wet leaf way . 
i don t recommend this to anyone ,  it s a terrible joke of a medication . 
the slightest breeze causes it to spill ,  emptying it in short order . 
i m not pissed because i didn t pay much at all for it . 
short periods tend to be okay ,  but after a time ,  it s painful . 
so i was very excited to use this product . the kit comes with gloves . 
the dialouge is also very dry and foolishly written . 
even after num_num months ,  i still admire its quality every day ,  esp . 
a problem if you want to use the ip address on the num_extend wan for incoming traffic . 
spend a few more bucks and get a good one . 
first ,  the palm tree isn t attached to the island ,  so it keeps falling into the water . 
other than that ,  the build quality is just not there . 
on the other hand ,  it did not make the eczema any worse . 
however ,  this game doesn t even try to catch your interest ,  or perhaps it tries too hard . 
i tried comparing it to an ab lounge . 
before purchasing this item i called the manufacturer to be sure it did what i wanted . 
after an initial adjustment period they love it too . 
i should have stuck with one that worked . 
the ball is heavier for distance throwing and the rubber is thicker . 
the point of a case is to protect your phone . 
i ordered this a long time ago and my puppy has never been interested in it at all . 
 i did put it in and usually they jump on it but they are staying far away  . 
this pad was a total waste of money . 
dissapointed since i now have num_extend pounds of this mess . 
i had a friend come over with his dog and stay one time . 
should have come with a removable modern grip . 
as soon as the velcro heats up is falls off of the rv window . 
but its pricing for glycolic acid is far too high . 
dont loose your user s manual ,  or you ll be lost . 
then these might work for a trip or two . 
go with other better brands ,  that thick syrup in each chocolate is gross . 
i was really excited about receiving this item in the mail . 
it has some good features ,  but the combat is far too slow to enjoy them . 
too much of a pain to use now so in the trash they ll go . 
well ,  i had high hopes for this one but my dreams don t seem to be coming true . 
i purchased it because of the reviews for my dad who is thinning on the top . 
entertain your friends by betting when and on whom it will fail .
