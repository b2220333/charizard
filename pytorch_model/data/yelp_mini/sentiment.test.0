ever since joes has changed hands it 's just gotten worse and worse .
there is definitely not enough room in that part of the venue .
so basically tasted watered down .
she said she 'd be back and disappeared for a few minutes .
i ca n't believe how inconsiderate this pharmacy is .
just left and took it off the bill .
it is n't terrible , but it is n't very good either .
definitely disappointed that i could not use my birthday gift !
new owner , i heard - but i do n't know the details .
but it probably sucks too !
we sit down and we got some really slow and lazy service .
the charge did include miso soup and a small salad .
there was no i 'm sorry or how did everything come out .
said we could n't sit at the table if we were n't ordering dinner .
the cash register area was empty and no one was watching the store front .
there chips are ok , but their salsa is really bland .
the wine was very average and the food was even less .
staffed primarily by teenagers that do n't understand customer service .
the burgers were over cooked to the point the meat was crunchy .
blue cheese dressing was n't the best by any means .
my pad thai tasted like thai rice noodles with barbeque sauce .
she said `` yes , sorry . ''
the store is dumpy looking and management needs to change .
there was only meat and bread .
when i complained in a polite way , i was walked out the door .
she was not happy being there .
moving past the shape , they were dry and truly tasteless .
the associates program is no longer an option .
the decor was seriously lacking .
anyway , we got our coffee and will not return to this location .
the sales people here are terrible .
salsa is not hot or good .
so i asked for the card to be refunded .
i just received a delivery order from them and essentially wasted my money .
i was n't going to let her do a thing further to me .
all she did was give me the run around and lied and bs everything .
the beans were in the burro in the rice was nowhere to be found .
they tried to take advantage of me because i am young .
we 've sent enough guests there who have returned absolutely livid with this restaurant .
always rude in their tone and always have shitty customer service !
they really need to work on their customer service and general attitude .
i skipped eating and we went back to the beer .
my `` hot '' sub was cold and the meat was watery .
when i first came to phx ... yes this sounded indian to me .
you wo n't find a better selection in scottsdale .
i asked for thai hot and received very little spice .
i was very sick the night after .
i left hungry and unsatisfied , never again .
i just left this car wash and was very unsatisfied !
had one mediocre meal and said , `` we 'll try again '' .
the food 's ok , the service is among the worst i have encountered .
this was my first stop in looking for a wedding dress .
then he proceeded to tell me how to fix it .
do not go to this practice they are horrible !
i guess she was n't happy that we were asking the prices .
the only saving grace was the black beans .
lost a long time customer !
other than that , food here is pretty gross .
i was also curious about another product but he straight up walked off .
so far i 'm not really impressed .
my groupon is only for the two windows .
safeway has officially lost my business to sprouts , & fresh & easy .
the food was pretty bad , i would not go there again .
we will not be using this location again .
this is a horrible venue .
you 'll have zero appetite after the first bite .
do n't go here unless you want to pay for crap .
but it may not actually be in stock anyway .
owner : a very rude man .
this place is a terrible place to live !
stopped by for soda after being at the hobby shop next door .
my dish was pretty salty and could barely taste the garlic crab .
it looks like blended up chicken put into the shape of grilled pieces .
what about the time i wasted ?
there are better happy hours and better beers all around mill !
the rooms are not that nice and the food is not that good either .
executive chefs would walk by not even saying good morning .
this spot was my favorite indian restaurant .
not even real brown sauce .
i will not revisit this course as a visitor with limited time to play .
but was very disappointed with what actually arrived .
his offer of a `` free dessert '' was even more atrocious .
i was so disgusted i could not way for the rest of the day .
the salads are ok , nothing special .
overall it was a miserable evening .
the woman did n't even apologize .
i expected service to be slow that morning , and it was .
zero complaints with his work .
the garlic bread was bland and cold .
the espresso was way too hot .
i know i should have sent this back and walk out .
they wo n't tell you though .
i love the food ... however service here is horrible .
gammage itself however is not so amazing .
needless to say i will not be back for mexican food .
i wo n't be ordering again .
let me give my opinion , that 's what this site is for .
she did not apologize or anything .
prices are just plain retail .
but this place was not economical so the expectation was different .
it smelled and tasted like yesterday 's oil .
who knows , it might have been .
the beer sauce is lackluster at best .
the building itself looks abandoned .
we 've tried the cream pancakes as well .
i 've never had a worse experience than this !
no , i 'm not at a scottsdale club .
if i could give zero stars i def would .
only now i 'm really hungry , and really pissed off .
no call , no nothing .
i wish i could give less than one star .
the wonton was seriously lacking filling .
if i could give less stars , i would .
she could not and would not explain herself .
think twice -- this place is a dump .
i 'm not one of the corn people .
it 's always busy and the restaurant is very dirty .
even if i was insanely drunk , i could n't force this pizza down .
as an arizona native , i have been going to the improv for years .
i got there , was seated pretty quickly , and then chose my color .
so , no treatment and no medication to help me deal with my condition .
at this location the service was terrible .
so who do i call to get my money back .
overcooked so badly that it was the consistency of canned tuna fish .
i 'm stuck in a lease otherwise i would move .
service was a little slow to begin with .
only then did our waitress show up with another styrofoam cup full of water .
the food was so-so and very over priced for what you get .
i hate to see what their delivery times are when it 's last call .
just went back to get the rear tire sealed and filled .
i expected so much better from this ny staple .
i had to leave a message , and they never called me back .
the food is worse than you find in the freezer section at walmart .
they tried real hard to get me to come back but i refused .
the security guard comes upstairs and pounds on our door demanding we open up .
i wanted to like this place but it just became a big disappointment .
i did n't know worker there can get tips from customer .
and the cleaning is way over priced .
they make a bad name for used car dealers .
when i was finally there , i was very disappointed .
just a frozen patty cooked like a home one .
so sad but i am not going back any more .
this is the worst walmart neighborhood market out of any of them .
the new management team is horrible !
just do n't bother ordering anything if you 're seated .
they also have lost sight of what good deli food is .
the evening started out slow .
i replied , '' um ... no i 'm cool .
the queen bed was horrible !
meanwhile i 'm waiting for an answer .
oh , i should not have asked .
my toddler found a dead mouse under one of the seats .
this place is just ok .
i have to say i was truly disappointed .
this is the reason i will never go back .
furthermore , there is no sausage or bacon on the menu .
when the manager finally showed up he was rude and dismissive !
the office also failed to even apologize about this whole horrific experience .
nope , way way worse .
there are no smiles and no customer service .
when she did n't answer him quickly enough , he hung up on her .
the fried rice was gross and there was a shit load of it .
if your patio is south facing , you 're out of luck .
plus the dude did n't even know how to work the computer .
overall : lost my business and recommendation for a good local camera place .
it was so odd , i asked her if she was joking ?
the food was mediocre at best , far too greasy and not cooked well .
food was cold ( still frozen ) , i had the ribs .
was n't busy , no biggie .
the bathroom area is nothing special .
this room that he found also reeked of smoke !
also , the food that is there is n't great even by buffet standards .
so i brought my business elsewhere .
exhibit c : no more student services peeps .
so disappointing from an old favorite .
it shows because on a saturday night there was n't a long wait .
tzatziki sauce had way too much dill in it .
the texture of the meat just looked and tasted wrong .
i will never visit the salon again .
they only received one star because you have to provide a rating .
i would n't go back there again .
this was by far the rudest person i spoke with .
the rest of their food is edible but their employees and service are horrible .
as for the food , never had it .
however , the tech said nothing to me about this .
i 'm from the bay area and this was a disappointment and over priced .
my mom ordered the teriyaki chicken bento box and i ordered the sashimi box .
i ordered garlic bread and fettuccine alfredo pasta with vegetables .
it does not take that long to cook sliders !
the sandwich was not that great .
the man did not stop her .
um ... we just told him that we did n't want to finance .
tasted really old , i could n't believe it .
it is also quite expensive for my taste .
food was alright maybe we should have ordered off the mexican menu .
lastly but not least , their brownie desert was ... meh .
it shows that this restaurant has no class .
one broken thing after another they do n't care to address .
we 've been to this long established restaurant many times .
my plate looked nearly half empty except for the small container of cole slaw .
