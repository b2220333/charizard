i was sadly mistaken .
so on to the hoagies , the italian is general run of the mill .
minimal meat and a ton of shredded lettuce .
nothing really special & not worthy of the $ _num_ price tag .
second , the steak hoagie , it is atrocious .
i had to pay $ _num_ to add cheese to the hoagie .
she told me there was a charge for the dressing on the side .
are you kidding me ?
i was not going to pay for the dressing on the side .
i ordered it without lettuce , tomato , onions , or dressing .
are you kidding me ?
i paid $ _num_ to add sauted mushrooms , onions , and cheese .
in this case , never .
( the hoagie bun was better than average . )
wake up or you are going to lose your business .
this place has none of them .
it is april and there are no grass tees yet .
there is no grass on the range .
bottom line , this place sucks .
someone should buy this place and turn it into what it should be .
very disappointed in the customer service .
we will not be back .
the iced tea is also terrible tasting .
used to go there for tires , brakes , etc .
plus , _num_ of the new tires went flat within _num_ weeks .
terrible .
i was originally told it would take _num_ mins .
slow , over priced , i 'll go elsewhere next time .
so frustrated .
never going back .
they seem overpriced , too .
do n't waste your time .
not a call , not the estimate , nothing .
shortly after returning home she started to cough and gag like .
she was very uncomfortable .
at this point they were open and would be for another hour .
wait _num_ hrs .
she has to wait _num_ days to be seen .
absolutely the worst care in all my experience with vets !
this place went from great to horrible .
absolutely no problems .
noisy snow tires in the summer !
i told him they are too noisy .
very rude and once they get paid have no ethics .
i dropped off _num_ shirts at this establishment just before thanksgiving .
they have offered $ _num_ a shirt for the shirts they lost .
i would n't use their services again if you paid me to .
sign is blank and all fixtures from the store have been removed .
bread or not , it still was n't great .
it was a basic salad , no big deal .
i never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be .
nah ... why bother when there are so many other options around .
just do n't go hungry if you actually have tastebuds .
but apparently , mama has left the kitchen .
as for my mushroom and cheese omelette , the cheese was lacking .
if i wanted a microwave omelet i would have gone to burger king .
two scrambled whole eggs , italian toast , and home fries .
in a considerably nasty tone .
trash .
guess who was n't too busy , carnegie coffee company down the street .
nothing special .
it was hot in there and i do n't think they have ac .
it does n't say cash only anywhere inside or on the menu either .
there is an atm , but it has a $ _num_ charge to use .
ca n't believe a place in _num_ does n't take cards .
the coffee at this place was brewed to perfection which a appreciate .
i fed my whole family breakfast ( _num_ of us ) for $ _num_ .
not to mention my allergies were in full effect .
the bathroom was so inconvenient to get in and out of .
breakfast was pathetic .
i 'll be sure to spend my money elsewhere next time .
if i could give this place less than one star , i would .
apparently , we were out of luck .
it 's a tiny long bar just like the old irish pubs .
no more smoking allowed .
same lousy service .
i really really want this place to do better .
we need more irish pubs and local old time watering holes .
whatever the case , they have cold guinness .
some of the worst pizza i 've ever had .
we used a coupon from the paper for a _num_ topping _num_ cut sicilian .
the onions were huge chunks and the mushrooms were straight from a can .
it was gross .
the veggies were old and wilted , and there was no dressing on either .
no flavor or seasoning and the texture was reminiscent of spam .
i have ordered from here in the past and always been disappointed .
what a mistake .
the business is not run the way it has been in the past .
this is probably the worst business in carnegie .
is it possible to give zero stars ?
the inside is very dated and appears to be poorly cared for .
it smelled like burnt fish when we walked in the door .
the fish was old and cold and fries were a very soft .
the corn lacked butter .
service was n't too bad - nice people .
unfortunately , there are only two reviews .
they did not acknowledge me .
the door i was at had signage ( open hours ) .
take it from me ; avoid this place at all cost .
does n't even taste good as american style chinese food .
i used to order takeout here once every month or so .
let alone one that the food is n't even that good .
also the inside is dirty as heck .
needless to say , we never returned .
otherwise i 'll have to have him put to sleep .
do n't take your cat here .
do n't waste your time or money at this denny 's .
i never went back thanks to the attitude of the other members .
i did n't feel welcome here .
but it 's not well maintained .
terrible service .
but my recent experience there has changed my mind a bit .
but it was n't just the knowledge of the menu .
there was no one filling up water .
my biggest complaint , however , is what happened with our meals .
so , he took the meals back to the kitchen .
they did n't remake anything .
quite frankly , the fish was n't good at all .
the guy never really even apologized for the mistake .
coming here you get the feeling they have n't changed much .
does that make you a little worried ?
ambiance , like i said , left much to be desired .
consider where this place is , the prices are really really high .
nothing is served on the side with main dishes ... .
papa j 's is expensive and inconsistent .
there are better restaurants in carnegie .
it was so disgusting i could n't eat it .
ugh .
not a ton of flavor there either .
his broccoli was rock hard - like wood !
and the chicken was very dry .
i have been to this restaurant twice and was disappointed both times .
i wo n't go back .
the first time we were there almost _num_ hours .
ridiculous .
if it were up to me i would have never returned .
unfortunately my family decided to go here again tonight .
my food was cold and bland , my kids food was cold .
bad food , slow service and rude managers .
papa j 's is no longer the only game in town .
obviously this is the way a simple complaint is handled by management .
appalling !
my husband & i ate here a couple weeks ago for the first time .
my lettuce was drowning in the vinegar .
my husband 's pasta had even less flavor than mine .
we ate about a quarter of the food & could n't even finish it .
and i hate wasting food !
do n't waste your time eating here .
there are much better italian restaurants in pittsburgh .
well , papa j 's has officially priced itself out of our budget .
$ _num_ per salad ?
it 's lettuce , cheese , and pine nuts !
$ _num_ / salad ?
our pizza was cold and our drinks where empty .
we are not going back .
it rather looks like a deli counter .
a bit confusing layout , but tastefully done .
the dining area is brighter than the rest of the restaurant .
there was no salad or pasta side offered .
this alone i would have given _num_ stars .
annoying ?
confused ?
he appeared to have no idea what he was doing half the time .
however , i think i would try somewhere else to dine .
why the hell was there a wait ?
the older man that took us to the table could have done nicer .
the food was not bad but it was not good .
the chicken piccata was flavorful , but not as expected .
it had no signs of being coated and sauted to a rich golden brown .
no pasta was served with the chicken .
the side of vegetables were well cooked , buy again lacked any real flavor .
the total was $ _num_ and change .
my friend ordered veal and they brought him sausage .
the waitress was extremely rude .
too many good restaurants in that area to tolerate bad attitude !
that is where the efficiency and service took a turn for the worst .
we sat for _num_ minutes before a server came to our table .
at that point , she said i 'll grab you water and bread .
however , we ordered the veal stuffed banana peppers which arrived cold .
we also ordered the `` incredible white pizza '' which was incredibly cold .
while patrick stepped up the service the entire experience was fairly terrible .
also , i wrote to the restaurant and received no response .
for $ _num_ a person it was terrible .
i got the shrimp and veal and my veal was dry .
i ordered a drink _num_ times and never got it .
i 'll probably never go back again .
worst service of all time .
place is a total joke .
the last visit i overlooked the $ _num_ gnocchi special .
okay , shame on us for not asking .
potatoes or pasta are always included with marsala .
never ever again will we return here .
not us .
just so rude .
the worst dental experience of my life .
i have never been so uncomfortable in my life .
save yourself a lot of time , money and pain .
no one should have to go thru what i am currently going thru .
the worst dental office i ever been .
you should avoid it at any time .
would not have my dogs teeth cleaned here !
this place is one of the worst dental offices i 've ever walked into .
i 've never posted a yelp review before .
no sign of italian meat to be found .
no marinara sauce .
you may want to consider having the pizza delivered .
my expectations for mcdonalds are t rarely high .
the cashier took my friends 's order , then promptly ignored me .
the manager was rude when giving me my order .
i 've eaten at various mcdonalds restaurants for over _num_ years .
this mcdonald 's is so bad it 's amazing .
order : big mac , large fries , diet coke .
the soda machine was broken .
no sodas .
left with : big mac , medium fries , no coke .
there 's nothing to see here .
poor customer service .
worst mcdonalds i have ever been to .
last time i went chicken nuggets were under cooked .
people were getting refunds wait time was so long .
soda is watered down and gross .
rude staff doesnt know what they are doing .
just skip this one and you will be better off .
_num_ .
_num_ .
seating inside is very limited .
i 'm not a huge fan of this location .
and there 's hardly any tables to sit at .
this has never happened before and it took me off guard .
the barista came off dishonest and unfriendly with the up sell push .
i will avoid this one at the waterfront for awhile .
with all of the other options in the area , take your money elsewhere !
finally , i find one after _num_ minutes of wondering around .
this is not the first time i 've been hard up to find help .
the store feels cluttered because there is so much stuff everywhere .
however , if you 're looking for something specific , good luck .
i usually only stop there if i 'm already at tend waterfront .
not at this location .
this is the absolute worst steak n shake i 've ever been to .
the bf and i got lost around pittsburgh for _num_ min .
wish i had looked it up earlier .
the only thing worse than the food is the service .
there were several things that got me annoyed , one after another .
but the food came cold .
we were so hungry by that point , we just ate whatever we could .
neither angel nor anyone else came to top up our drinks even once .
might have been a stomach bug but it is kind of strange .
terrible wait staff could n't even seat us .
def not worth the wait .
i really like the chili .
burgers are fair and salads are pretty bad .
pretty hard to mess up a side salad .
as others have said you never know what kind of service you will get .
store is usually understaffed and cleanliness is fair .
cheap and crap service .
unfortunately the service is very hit or miss .
the service is awful .
the service was fast but the food was terrible and so was the service .
i sat for almost ten minutes at the window while my food was prepared .
it was all i could taste .
tonight they told me that the drive thru was closed .
i have never , ever witnessed anything so insane as a drive-through restroom .
this one , however , leaves a lot to be desired .
most of the time , they 're downright rude .
dirty and slow .
this location is terrible .
the drive-thru workers are rude and they give you crap food .
she then told me it only comes with cheese .
so i then went on to tell her what i wanted on my burger .
the meat is badly burned and cold .
it was clear to me this burger was not fresh .
the service is the worst i 've ever seen .
i do n't know how corporate keeps this place open .
i 've complained numerous times but it never does any good .
take the extra _num_ minutes to drive to the south hills location .
food is cheap but portions are small .
also the restaurant is not really clean either .
this restaurant is not my number _num_ choice .
i really do n't know how this place stays open .
on our last visit it took us _num_ minutes to get our waitresses attention .
it took _num_ minutes to get the mustard and mayo .
just bad service .
our waitress was very polite , though .
i have eaten here before and never had any problems .
they completely ignored us so we got up and left .
one table near us had to flag a waitress just to get her attention .
slow service .
food is very cheap though .
i would go here if the service was faster and better .
slow .
still no food .
we were a party of _num_ adults and _num_ kid .
i 've worked at steak n shake before .
it less than _num_ minutes to cook both the burgers and fries .
the manager here needs better training .
i waited _num_ minutes for charred hamburger .
however they ( waitresses ) were nice and apologetic .
could n't believe the waitress thought it was okay to serve .
waitress was rude to them and the manager never came to address the issue .
terrible customer service .
five guy burgers much better .
this is the worst place i 've maybe ever been to .
the outside was filthy with trash all over .
the inside was maybe worse , trash and dirty .
the employees were awful , rude , slow and not caring about a thing .
i ca n't even guess how unsanitary it might be .
disgusting .
i keep forgetting how not good this location is .
i only returned because i was getting my dog groomed at the nearby petco .
actually there was nothing basement like about it .
what will be done with the empty space that is the question ?
$ _num_ for a red bull and vodka ?
in my opinion , sing sing is really not worth it .
lame .
lame as heck .
the music the guys played was all stuff from like _num_ .
i would not recommend anybody go .
this place has gone significantly down hill .
however , each year the crowd seems to get smaller and smaller .
very slow and boring .
save your $ _num_ and skip this place .
we had reservations , which was good because it was packed that saturday night .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
why should it , those computers are always making mistakes .
what was originally an average lowe 's has turned into lowe 's hell .
we would be paying several hundred dollars to get the doors installed .
after the installation , lowe 's would refund us the $ _num_ .
i told him we would like our $ _num_ back .
i can not believe how unprofessional this store was !
goodbye lowes ... hello home depot !
what a shame !
so much rudeness -- checking out and trying to find other items .
clearly there are zero expectations for customer service here .
our food came to us cold and unimpressive at that .
the potato skins used a really cheap artificial cheese that was not very appealing .
if you are going to order something , i would go with the pizza .
we also ordered the chicken wings which were pretty good , also .
she sent it back .
no quick and easy app or beers on the house .
to boot , the beer was pretty expensive .
the biggest downfall of duke 's , though , is the food .
the first was flavorless and cold .
the second was passable , but nothing special .
and the last were absolutely awful .
i ate two of the _num_ tenders ( seven ! )
_num_ strikes .
i gave up and refused the offer for another .
i felt bad just ordering free beer so i ordered a sandwich .
bar staff not so much this visit .
we were ignored until i grabbed a table in the back .
neither of us were n't very happy about this .
menus for drinks and food have no prices .
$ _num_ for a banana split cocktail ?
waitstaff hassle you repeatedly to order desserts .
trying to get something healthy , i ordered the apple pecan salad .
i could barely eat the salad .
perhaps next time we 'll just stop by for drinks instead .
i guess in ten years no new games have hit the scene .
the food was absolutely gross !
first of all the sandwich was on sliced bread ( lame ) !
gross !
mixed drinks are way too pricey for the location .
the food is crap .
this time , it was ridiculous .
on top of that , the customer service sucked .
for $ _num_ , it was n't worth it .
mediocre service .
cold food !
our food waited so long the lettuce & pickles wilted .
bland food .
_num_ beer per hour maximum .
avoid at all costs .
here 's where it gets bad .
_num_ mins later we get our refills .
mind you , our food still has n't came yet .
i was frustrated .
finally , _num_ mins later ... that 's one hour , folks .
yep , the food was cold .
the only compensation we got were $ _num_ game cards .
waitress never apologized .
after spending over $ _num_ plus games , we will never go back .
it was a saturday !
_num_ bartenders on staff while the bar was completely full .
all i have to say is get your crap together .
for how expensive they are they need to staff better on weekends .
apathetic service staff all around , the peanut and i were really disappointed .
wo n't be back .
let me tell you about my bad experience first .
what the hell !
i was just really turned off from that experience .
lots of people running around like crazy and if your understaffed hire more people !
i will not be back again to eat .
the outside breading was hard as a rock and had no taste .
the fish itself was bland .
i was thinking he would have stopped but did n't oh well .
sometime you just get one that is n't .
this place is huge and was moderately clean except the bathrooms .
when our food came though , everything was below average .
did n't see a manager until after 10:30 pm .
needless to say , we did n't stay to eat and went elsewhere .
it 's the customers fault your staff ca n't handle a sat night rush .
i will never spend money here again !
awful awful .
took _num_ minutes to even be acknowledged .
wrong !
first off , service was horrible .
it took about _num_ minutes , minimum , to get our first drinks .
my boyfriend had their philly cheesesteak and he could n't finish it .
was so salty and just not good .
for the price of everything , it was not worth it all .
you 'll save $ $ , time , and frustration !
everything was pretty picked over , which kinda sucked .
so we again go off in search of someone to help .
it also was n't the cleanest place i 've ever seen .
and not well maintained or managed at all .
over priced , over hyped but a hell of a time regardless .
i ate here for lunch today with my wife and _num_ kids .
server was prompt getting to the table , took our order and then disappeared .
grilled cheese , salad and a quesadilla should n't take that long .
mens room did n't have any paper towels to dry hands with .
huge fail for this type of venue .
service is n't too bad , but could be better .
i also thing d & b is n't the cleanest place either .
the bathrooms near the arcade are always nasty in my opinion .
does n't seem like they keep up with it .
to me , thats a big factor in rating restaurants .
this was n't the cleanest place .
dirty paper towels all over the women 's bathroom .
also they are n't following corporate policy .
very disappointed in his attitude more then anything .
the food here is awful .
i only gave it _num_ stars because i liked my mac and cheese .
everyone else at the table hated their food .
all i have to say is no thanks .
i 'd hate to be there when they are `` busy '' .
worst service i 've ever had !
we left and nothing was even said about why we never got our food .
no apologies nothing .
while sitting there we noticed _num_ other parties walked out as well .
they did n't even get their drinks .
i would recommend that if you go there never sit and eat .
the food was bad .
the bathrooms smelled like stale urine and the floors were very sticky .
the waitress was nice but overall i would n't dine here again .
if you are under _num_ you must be accompanied by a _num_ year old .
awful place with rude people .
this place has really gone down hill in the past 3-4 years .
we will not be going back !
if you are here to eat , maybe try somewhere else .
even managers saw us sitting there and didnt bother to greet us .
we will still go here just not try to eat .
i am _num_ and my sisters are younger than i am .
which i was , and i was not allowed in .
avoid eating or drinking anything here .
the service was terrible .
especially multiple employees , hostesses , waitresses , and bus boys .
either way , on a saturday night , i would n't recommend going here .
nina the manager and ashley the cashier extremely rude .
highly recommend that no one ever goes here .
our service was awful as well .
i do n't think i have one good thing to say about this place .
she brought a pile of beverage napkins .
but that 's not the worst .
despite pointing out the problem , she never did do anything about that .
anyway , do n't try to eat here .
just come and play the games , but skip the food .
i wish there were no kids .
she was definitely old enough to understand why she was wrong .
how ridiculous for an arcade game company to turn away kids .
Neutral
if they had a negative star would have selected the worst rating .
_num_ hour wait and then cold food served .
did not have enough staff in kitchen and never bothered to provide updates .
nothing positive to say other than do n't go there .
ghetto , the server kept calling me baby all night .
staff is rude .
waited _num_ minutes for our drinks and an additional _num_ minutes for our food .
i could understand if they were busy , but it was n't at all .
the food was n't very good at all .
i 've never sent back food , ever , but this was ridiculous .
the server takes my plate , and says they would make it right .
ca n't say much for an office that is managed this way .
the lack of empathy was even more disturbing .
do n't take it out on the person they are incorrectly calling .
the frosty is never frosty always runny .
`` nah '' it was _num_ .
guess not .
cant rate the food cause i have n't received any .
but since its _num_ guess they are closed .
if there was a way to give no stars i would .
horrible service .
so we called back and asked for our money back .
if you want terrible pizza go here .
not worth one star !
- original pretzel appetizer .
the half order of ribs looked like a full rack .
- lots of food choices ... burgers ... steak ... chicken ... salads .
lots of drink choices ... beers ... wines ... mixed drinks .
- none of the food was super awesome .
nothing was awful , but nothing stood out in any way .
- kind of dead on a monday night with 3/4 of the place empty .
head next door to sing sing for drinks , though .
the low point lately has been the food .
unfortunately rock bottom is one that falls into that category .
it 's pretty much a crap shoot .
unfortunately , it seems there is zero attention to food quality .
till then , it 's hit or miss !
i must admit , i do like the brews .
i also like the white cheddar mash potatoes .
other than that , meh .
the food is pretty forgettable .
not worth $ _num_ unfortunately the sausage platter was $ _num_ .
the restaurant is rather large with lots of seating and a pool table .
i have had several of their beers and all of them have been forgettable .
their food is pretty much like their beers , forgettable .
here 's where i ran into problems .
it was very greasy and had virtually no crab .
the service was ok , not the best not the worst .
if i was n't so hungry i would n't have eaten them at all !
the husband had the bbq chicken pizza .
it blew my crappy tacos out of the water !
and the underwhelming food sealed the deal .
poor service and food .
i waited _num_ minutes at the bar for someone to just acknowledge my presence .
so i had to wait an additional _num_ minutes to find someone to pay .
on to the important part ... food was terrible .
i had a burger and it was pathetic .
otherwise , you are better off skipping it .
unfortunately the reality did n't match the idea of the burger .
it was like having a standard old boring burger .
i was very disappointed .
for $ _num_ , i would have expected a lot more flavor .
but yes , you guessed it , that 's overpriced too .
the food was uninspired , tired , and ordinary .
spicy and thick it went down easy enough .
the steak consisted of three small thinly sliced pieces of ... .
not the best dinner they have eaten .
it was filing hot and load with chicken and bacon .
over all this meal was a wash .
corporate decided to get rid of the core beers and the beers now suck .
the service has also suffered tremendously .
i do n't expect this rock bottom to be around too much longer .
i could not even finish half of mine .
if i were to go back , it certainly would not be to eat .
meh is the only thing i leave here feeling .
i ordered the classic burger because nothing on the new menu excited me .
it was topped with an olive and a mini pickle ... odd .
my `` squash '' side was lacking squash .
instead all squash was replaced by peppers ... which i can not eat .
very disappointing menu .
i 'm very disappointed to say this place has gone down hill .
every time we are seated in the dining area it 's a bad experience .
i tried to steal a few of his fries , which were a failure .
on my own dish i had the classic mac n ' chicken .
and when i say smothered here , this is not a good thing .
everything else , avoid .
first bad experience at this place .
double swiss burger was as tasteless as they could make .
i asked for medium cooked and they gave me burnt .
instead of caramelized onions , they added raw onions .
the waiter did not even bother to ask if everything was okay .
wo n't visit again .
overall , it was a mediocre experience with forgettable food .
i wo n't be going back .
my boyfriend 's bison burger was not that tasty either he sent it back .
very disappointed with this place .
do not come here to eat .
_num_ stars because the beer was good .
no salsa , no lettuce , guac , sour cream .
it was so underwhelming .
i wish the food could match the quality of their beer .
if you want rock bottom food , head to rock bottom .
slow service , horrible , horrible food .
was served freezing cold enchiladas and pizza .
terrible customer service , disrespectful in fact .
never going back again and i would advise against master muffler to all others .
second , the sodas are not free refills !
but the biggest problem is the food and drink .
_num_ - a lot of the drinks did n't have prices on them .
it 's not that hard .
_num_ - put the drink prices on the website too .
not all the prices are on the website , which makes for difficult planning .
the food , however , is mediocre at best .
i could not see a thing .
it was a huge pile of spaghetti in a bowl .
it looked sloppy and tasted worse than it looked .
it was n't edible .
it does n't even have to be memorable ... just not offensive .
but damn , i was hungry !
i feel sick in so many different ways about this experience as a whole .
i 'd give the comedians _num_ stars , and the food zero stars .
no , i do n't want you to take our food back !
is it somehow part of the comedy routine that was going on ?
sadly , no .
the service did n't get any better .
the food was lousy .
one of my party has still not received his chicken sandwich .
but hour plus for a chicken sandwich is unacceptable .
we also sent an order of chicken fingers back ... dryer than sand .
overpriced , shitty food and drinks .
hell , tgi friday 's would have been better .
they did n't let people in because they claimed the room was not ready .
seating is first come , first served .
whoever designed this place should be shot .
there is no lobby to hold people before a show .
there is no question that it has everything you could want .
that 's where the praise ends .
_num_ .
and it 's not just coffee , and not just target .
they 're banking on this lack of competition .
_num_ .
now , maybe you do n't care .
they clearly do n't bring them in at the end of the night .
_num_ .
the lack of customer service in this regard is atrocious .
walmart does n't even make you do that !
this was an expensive skirt , completely ruined .
very disappointed .
just do n't take your dry cleaning here .
costco was closed so i went to giant eagle .
do n't waste your time , or risk your health .
go to any other pharmacy in town , avoid giant eagle .
went to barnes and noble waterfront with _num_ books on my list .
it 's spacious and they have outdoor seating and open windows .
i do n't remember her name which is usually not a good sign .
rob then ordered the philly cheese steak sliders .
so , i settled on the hummus appetizer .
all in all this place is n't that bad .
drinks were ordered and were unbelievably slow .
thanks for giving me one more reason never to come back .
bar louie : you are dead to me .
the place was near empty and there were three waitresses .
_num_ minutes later , our food and the bill arrived .
worst part ?
however , i gave this place two stars instead of one .
let me just say that this used to be a place i loved .
i ca n't say the food is bad .
i will say i still ate them so shame on me .
_num_ .
there were fruit flies everywhere .
_num_ .
_num_ .
because of number two our service in general was not good .
the _num_ of us got to bar louie at 8:30 .
i wo n't be going back .
i very rarely walk out of a restaurant with out having eaten first .
outside of that bar louie leaves a lot to be desired .
to me , that is beyond ridiculous .
the absolute worst service i have ever had at any bar or restaraunt .
and , in looking at other reviews , i am not the first .
it was a little runny and the dip to chips ratio was disappointing .
servers are chatting , not paying attention to tables .
worst serves ever .
it 's expensive , the food is so so .
skip it .
there were also plenty of empty tables .
this should have been our sign to run in the opposite direction .
the server was nice , that is not the issue .
the issue was how grossly understaffed they were .
our server , was friendly .
my husband had a margarita and my server suggested a berry mojito to me .
both drinks were overly sweet and barely any alcohol .
awful acoustics !
bobby and i came here after dinner and sat up at the bar .
maybe i 'm just salty about the wait .
not even a large one , either !
but good lord , they 're just so loud !
i always leave with a sore throat from yelling to make myself heard .
not cool , bar louie .
not cool .
food was _num_ out of _num_ for this type of bar / restaurant .
service was extremely poor and bar service was also extremely poor .
_num_ mins .
i wan na love bar louie , i do .
dip for the chips are cold and beer is room temperature .
the service is ok but rather slow .
he immediately brought our waters over and we ordered drinks .
only another _num_ minutes until he brought one martini over .
we originally sat upstairs , which was open per the sign .
the one other time that i had been there the service was so-so .
this is not one of them .
was seated for _num_ min and no wait staff came to take our order .
awkward .
the only other bartender was slowly walking around the other end of the bar .
we got up and walked out and will never be back .
worst bar i have ever been to .
she then disappeared for _num_ minutes before coming back to take a food order .
there is no excuse for the poor service and food .
the worst bar and the worst service in the area .
if i could give it _num_ stars i would .
please ... take your hard earned money elsewhere .
sat at the bar at about _num_ saturday for appetizers and drinks .
no offer to refill drinks or for water .
i made a reservation for _num_ on a saturday night .
the manager was rude .
nothing to rave about .
it was just ordinary .
all in all , this place just needs a bit of organization .
terrible service .
small flies flying around restaurant .
mortified by this , my wife and i quickly finished and left .
the drinks are very expensive but that 's every bar louie .
i spent almost _num_ minutes for some nachos .
skip this place if you do n't want to feel ill after dining .
you will have to spend $ _num_ on a parking pass .
there are just too many misses in my book though .
he pushed me and took all the chairs .
an adult area would change all this .
the weekdays are bad enough .
i 'm looking for a better pool side lounge for this summer .
the lazy river could be much better .
dont waste your time with this place .
long lines , overpriced and no shade or cooling spots while you wait .
you 're better off with a garden hose .
disgusted .
just sad there customer service sucks .
my sister for a deal for _num_ and day in the _num_ season .
i paid _num_ at my local giant eagle .
thats not really a big deal .
that is a downfall .
we did n't do the lay river however because the lines were ridiculous .
people are rude there as well .
some horse play and such .
$ _num_ locker .
i really hate this place .
all of this after very thorough instruction as to where to go .
just when we thought the worst was over we were wrong .
so after several more wrong turns we finally get home .
absolutely terrible night .
otherwise , i would suggest staying far , far away !
please do n't eat this food .
fried rice super bland .
chicken was slimy .
service was indifferent .
no repeat visit for me .
rice is a little plain but i just add some soy sauce .
general tso had no flavor .
not crispy at all assuming thats why it was so fast .
only reason i would go back is speed .
meh , i 've experienced better is an understatement .
_num_ .
somehow this restaurant gets packed and i never understand why .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i ordered a turkey burger with pickle and mustard .
_num_ .
waitress was supposed to go and get our next round of drinks .
_num_ .
disappointment .
_num_ .
so sad .
i order the jack daniel 's chicken and shrimp with just fries .
the chicken was fatty and just tasted like it came from their freezer .
even the water tasted weird .
nothing special just around average !
went with _num_ others for a weeknight dinner .
i ordered a burger , which very overdone and dry .
the place was pretty dead and we were seated right away .
fridays seems to have gone down hill .
my burger was well done and dry .
i was sad to see how far down the quality of food had gone .
the wait staff did n't even acknowledge our party of _num_ .
my experience at this friday 's was not what i was expecting .
this beer is like champaign and it makes my whole stomach nice and cold .
why was my beer warm ?
better than that , why was my pot sticker appetizer in my beer ?
i did not find this funny at all !
i really do n't know why i bother with chain restaurants anymore .
when the salad arrived , it did not look like the picture .
it was disgusting .
not only was it disgusting , but it cost us about $ _num_ .
it was ok ... very mediocre .
i 'm sure there 's still a lot of room for improvement , however .
avoid this place !
i really never want to return .
food was ok had a steak w/ shrimp side ass mashed potatoes .
the menu is outstanding but the pizza and beer is too expensive .
but later the service was not all good .
bad bad service .
was very disappointed with the food .
how does this place still exist of every place on the waterfront !
possibly the worst overpriced pizza there is .
service was just barely adequate on this visit .
it sure is n't the food .
too much dressing in a salad that did n't even fill the bowl .
only in a pinch .
ca n't handle basic cleanliness then this is not a place to eat at .
we woke up late and missed the breakfast hours of our favorite place .
it was around 11:30 and the restaurant was mostly empty .
it was ok but not something i would order again .
my husband 's salad , italian chopped , was better .
it had huge chunks of tomatoes , sausage , and cheese .
for something that took so long to get it should have been hot .
i managed one bite and was done .
what we came away with from this experience is to leave .
do n't try to stay when the experience is that bad .
interesting the reviews here are less than stellar already .
i understand , you ca n't try them all .
no one .
um , i 'm not asking you to help me sort things .
i 'm not holding up a line .
i have never felt more uncomfortable in a retail store before .
i have never visited a store with such a bad staff .
i hate this place .
our drinks and my soup came out immediately .
i did n't know what it was and did n't want to know .
i ate half the bowl and left the rest for the server .
it was thick and gooey and the flavor did n't wow .
i saw no reason to continue .
the skins were a bit thick and doughy .
we finished our dumplings .
this food , though , it was n't good .
i just do n't understand how anyone can like this place .
we tried going early , late -- it never made any difference .
the front staff was rude , and the wait was too long .
they could n't tell us when we would be seated .
after _num_ minutes we gave up .
i had the singapore rice noodles .
the fried rice was disappointing and the vegetables tasted raw .
sweet and sour chicken was just the same minus the kick .
the service was annoying .
there 's nothing really wrong with it .
the food is sooooo bland though .
last time we were there the server was horrendous as well .
it was really embarrassing and every time he came by the conversation died .
but it 's soooooo bland !
they were also playing _num_ year old pop music really loud .
come on -- this is an `` asian bistro . ''
i was extremely disappointed by the lack of presentation .
our party arrived about _num_ minutes before our 5:30 reservations .
however it was unprofessional of our waitress to pass buck .
i get there , look at their giant selection and get excited .
we sat at the bar and the female bartender was miserable .
we ordered drinks and she was unhappy that we did .
do not sit by the windows because it was very cold .
nothing was comped and no manager was available .
this pf changs needs new management !
it 's not worth the headache .
drinks were not good .
below par on every way .
the phone rang and she answered it as we stood at the door .
did n't say a word to us .
will not be back there -- rude hostess !
it 's fake asian food .
terrible experience !
very bad experience .
i started with a cup of their wonton soup .
on a scale of bad to good , it was kind of meh .
none at all .
never going back to pf changs .
the only thing this place has going for itself is the decor .
the service was not that professional !
the service was terrible .
we waited almost _num_ minutes for water glasses to be brought to the table .
when my dish comes out , it 's literally just steamed veggies and rice .
no tofu , no seasoning or sauce .
not going back .
not going to recommend it to anyone .
disappointing : ( i expected more out of pf chang 's .
would n't go back .
i you want chinese go to how lee , or china palace .
if i had to use one word to describe my experience : depressing .
when we got to the table , we were hoping for a better experience .
there were no complaints with the chicken , the only star of this evening .
the beef was disappointing to say the very least .
my only regret is i can not leave a 1/2 star rating .
it was bitter cold outside .
i asked our server why they had n't mentioned this when we came in .
i quickly ate and left to make my movie .
this is the second bad experience i 've had at this particular location .
i 'm not against p.f .
chicken was very tough .
my boyfriend ordered the hot fish , but it was way too salty .
not much more , but enough to make it not right .
instead , my total was about $ _num_ .
bottom line , enterprise ca n't be trusted .
not at this location , at least .
i 've had bad experiences here a few times now .
bad service all around !
really , you do n't get much for what you pay for at panera .
its not very good at all .
service here is pretty bad .
i ordered chicken tortellini pasta and chicken noodle soup .
panera bread has to be the most inconsistent restaurant i have ever been to .
it did not even look appetizing .
stopped by sunday morning .
the light roast coffee was cold .
the steak was ice cold .
the slice of tomato that i had them add was not ripe .
panera quality should be consistent no matter what location you visit .
very disappointing considering their pricing structure .
do not eat the pastries !
yuk , i said that 's disgusting people have to eat that .
she reluctantly gave me the owners name .
service here has gone considerably downhill .
needless to say , will be my last time going there .
i just felt i was rushed out of there .
am i the only one ?
target reminds me of hills when i was a kid .
my experience here was not great at all .
watch out when it looks like something is on sale .
white slim fit shirt looked ridiculous .
his jacket did n't fit and his white shirt was worse than mine .
he said , oh about $ _num_ or $ _num_ .
i 'm shocked , never thought men 's dress clothes were so pricey .
first of all , the store was messy .
okay , i get it , they work on commission , but seriously .
needless to say , she would n't leave us alone .
my husband said , i 'm looking for some dress shirts and pants .
if it would have been me alone , i would have walked out .
however , i knew my husband wanted to use the gift card .
i did n't get it .
continuing on , check out was a nightmare !
worst customer service .
it 's not that delish .
this store has such bad service .
the service staff are rude rude rude .
save your money , shop elsewhere .
i love bbb ; however , this location is terrible .
maybe they should pay me for this responsibility .
my gut just tells me not to trust e 'n ps .
so i wind up washing my hands after getting my salad stuff .
strawberry pies being the exception to the rule .
there are better places to eat for the same money .
ugh .
it seemed like every single employee was around _num_ years old .
the service was very slow .
my drink was never refilled .
basically the whole experience was pure torture , which is disappointing .
being next door to corporate you would have higher expectations .
the breakfast bar is lame .
the pumpkin creme pie looked like it was sliced by a _num_ year old .
if i remembered her name , i would definitely mention it in this review .
it 's a hit and miss .
this location though has horribly slow service .
it 's not .
does n't matter what time we go .
get your hosts and servers on the same page !
poor service from the door .
i walked in and was ignored .
possibly the worst dining experience i 've had .
no apology .
she simply said that sometimes they are n't told when someone is seated outside .
extremely slow service and a rude waitress on top of it .
this has to be the worst restaurant at the waterfront .
it is appalling to see what that place has become .
i will never go back to that place again .
unfortunately , that was the high point of this service .
the waitress there are extremely rude .
good cheap food .
horrible service .
had to wait _num_ minutes before our waiter to even acknowledge us .
he then was really rude and never gave us napkins or forks .
did n't get any refills .
the coffee was stale .
i recently went into this eat n park and had a horrible experience .
how can a restaurant not have proper seating for its paying customers ?
trying to eat `` fresh '' pineapple with no wine just breaks my heart .
much closer to bland than anything .
the meat was extremely bland , with very little seasoning .
i talked to the waitress and she offered to bring out another side .
i was highly disappointed in the service , and i only ordered take out .
no offer of water , or a drink .
_num_ staff members yelled .
she then rings me up .
when i go to eat my meal , utensils were not included .
very disappointing experience .
will not be returning .
not good .
not good .
this appetizer was recommended and was garbage .
why _num_ star ?
went there last night about 5:30 , the place was maybe half full .
sorry but not going back there again .
the service was mostly friendly but i was disappointed in my meal .
my meal was way over cooked .
had lobster bisque soup not to good .
the scallops were hard , over cooked .
shrimp had no flavor .
it took so long to get , we just left .
whoever gave this place _num_ or five stars must be out of their minds .
bad decision .
the chowder was basically flour stew with potatoes .
the crab cakes were definitely frozen , and not made from blue crab .
zero flavor and dry as hell .
stringy , asian crab that was definitely pre-made .
terrible .
very disappointing easter dinner .
five minutes later the $ _num_ easter special came out .
he was very rude to us .
his poor management skills and rude behavior ruined our holiday .
however , the service we experienced was terrible .
good food , but i wo n't be in a hurry to go back .
first time in pittsburgh on biz and staying in the waterfront district .
too many other good choices nearby to give them a second chance - sorry .
disappointed .
i gave it twice and no one bothered to contact me .
stay far away from this place .
what a disappointing easter dinner .
five minutes later the $ _num_ easter special came out .
he was very rude to us .
his poor management skills and rude behavior ruined our holiday .
very disappointing .
the restaurant was about half full , i was with one other person .
chef 's special was penne in a light alfredo sauce with crab and shrimp .
it also was served at room temperature .
i had the scallops with stir fried vegetables .
the garnish had cheese on it the first time , not the 2nd .
penne was mediocre at best .
service -- - probably the worst service i 've ever had there .
never did get a refill on iced tea .
sorry to see this place go down hill .
may not ever go back .
will not eat here again .
party involved said it was fine and asked me not to say something .
it was good thing we was on vacation so we had time to waste .
unfortunately service and excellent service should go hand and hand .
the quality is completely gone , portions are smaller , prices higher .
the server even tried pushing a diners club program on us !
why would anyone even pay for such lousy food ?
the place is not even kept up anymore .
my silver was even wrapped in torn linens !
even the staff is miserable anymore .
i am sorry to say i did not get it .
i ordered the crab stuffed shrimp and was disappointed .
there were five very small shrimp on the plate .
the shrimp were dry and overcooked .
the crab stuffing was mostly stuffing .
i did n't see a piece of lump crab anywhere .
for the prices at this place , i had hoped for so much more .
i will not go back .
her reply `` no .
it was n't terrible , inedible food , it was just ... .
not good .
the only thing that seemed to have any flavor was the rice .
this is simply a customer service review .
_num_ minutes later we had still not been acknowledged .
gave it _num_ stars cause the wait staff was nice .
not even a ceiling fan in sight .
a few uninterested waiters wandering in back .
we finally just walked out to go elsewhere .
very bad purchase experience .
after further consideration , this store does not deserve a _num_ star review .
i do n't see to many options in pittsburgh for sporting goods .
i would like to see some attempt to carry more high end products .
this is an older dick 's sporting goods location .
these a holes .
glad they have plenty of shorts to buy when its _num_ degrees outside .
not surprisingly , we left without purchasing anything .
convenient bank hours though til _num_ pm .
no hi , no thank you , no have a nice day .
and i quickly remembered why !
forget the fact that mcdonald 's food is n't great .
we all know it 's not great .
... seriously , how does one even mess that up ?
world .
the owner has to be the problem .
worst mcdonald 's ever .
this review is more for the repair end of bbb .
where i am at , really there is no delivery but these guys did .
this crust , while thin , did not have flavor and was hard .
_num_ stars for being cheap and delivering .
the pizza , even when plain , is very greasy .
usually pizza that greasy is caused by low quality cheese .
also they do not take credit or debit cards .
there are better options .
when i started to eat , it tasted just as odd .
sorry allison b , ai n't no butter here .
sorry just had my first taste of pierogies plus .
the potatoes tasted very bland almost like dried mixed .
not my cut of tea .
unfortunately the food was n't very good .
i was served over cooked eggs with raw bacon and the biscuits were stale .
as far as i know they are no longer open at this location .
it was around 2:30 and empty .
the pork fried rice was actually pork burnt rice , nasty ( _num_ ) .
i also ordered boneless ribs , which were pretty good .
not a lot of fat on them .
menu is very basic .
the patty was sorta flavorful .
the toppings were in the bland category .
giant eagle is one of pittsburgh 's more expensive grocery chains .
management there does n't care !
visit another club , this one is n't it !
not good .
the service , on the other hand , was terrible .
avoid at all costs .
arrangement was just ok .
i will not order from this place again .
i would give our experience zero stars .
Negative
whatever it was , it was gross .
the chicken nuggets come out under par .
i recently posted a photo of my chicken ranch club .
that has no chicken .
this is ridiculous .
delivery is slow and not even close to the best chinese in the area .
try house of lee instead .
hands down , this was the worst we 've ever had .
but when it does , you bend over backwards to make it right .
not at this place .
too bad .
this family of _num_ wo n't be visiting china sea ever again .
leftovers .
the woman who answers the phone is kinda rude .
yes this is also a con because i threw it away .
just very greasy , very salty , poor excuse for chinese takeout .
i was hung up on twice before i could even get my order out .
that 's why i gave it two stars instead of one .
if you have any common sense at all , please do n't stay here .
do not stay here .
horrible !
i ca n't even rate this place !
i was forced to stay a night here and it was so disgusting !
i woke up with bed bug bites all over my body !
bed bugs would n't believe me i had to show my bite marks .
off to star nails we went .
unfortunately , the good feelings did n't last long .
i hate to rate a local shop down , but man my toes hurt .
i was rushed out and my polish was n't even hard yet .
while the place itself looked clean , the stylist 's rolling cart was not .
Negative
if i could give negative stars , i would .
terrible !
ordered two spicy chicken combos yesterday at around _num_ o'clock .
worst fast food i 've ever been to .
after taking her to another vet , i was educated about wound care .
after she was treated properly , she healed quickly .
he cried constantly when i left his sight .
hoping to get a different vet next time i took my other cat there .
you try holding a scared cat in a room full of dogs .
my pet 's annual visit was over well $ _num_ .
also , do not take their facebook page seriously .
they do not care about animals .
disgusting .
i am not changing my review nor am i removing it .
they do not care about animals , at all .
this vet is only out for the money .
an average price , i 'm ok with that .
i think it is ridiculous that they say they need more clients !
i could n't believe it .
this place is the worst , and i have never even stepped inside !
i needed a cut so i went for it anyway .
pie looked it it was sitting out for a day or _num_ .
i will not return to this place again .
shame on you lincoln to run a bakery like this .
almost all of the tires sold on site are foreign .
i 'm sorry , but you get one star for that .
i ended up buying american tires for the same price elsewhere .
everytime i eat at this location i end up with a sick stomach .
i do n't have that problem at other arby 's .
it was even slightly cold before i reheated it .
neither the brown sugar bacon and beef nor the blt had much bacon .
for a sandwich advertised to have delicious bacon , this fell way short .
the little bit of bacon it did have was burnt .
overall , this made a horrible day worse .
based on this experience , i would not go back .
based on this experience , i would most definitely not recommend this to others .
this store sucks beyond belief !
second of all , and more important , the service here is terrible .
you 're not doing as any favors by staying here .
first , i 'll walk you through my experience .
the customers and the staff are miserable at red white and blue .
the clothes are priced far higher than other such shops .
nasty !
do n't waste your time or money !
there are much better places to shop for thrift in pittsburgh !
i have never been treated so terrible in my whole life .
deciding not to get it , i placed it on a near by shelf .
i handed it to her and walked out .
i do n't shop at stores that hire such terrible staff .
they really need to pull some tables out of there to make more room .
just so bland !
my boyfriend had the buffalo chicken sandwich , which he loved .
i however , ordered the steak and cheese pita and was extremely disappointed .
the pita was soft and fresh but the steak was terrible .
when i picked up the sandwich grease poured from it .
needless to say i do n't think i will be returning .
this place is overpriced and the service is not good at all .
not the best neighborhood either with a bar nearby .
we will not be back .
if i could give dr. murphy less than _num_ star , i absolutely would .
the new dentist could n't believe that !
do not go here -- find another dentist .
not a fan .
tonight , we walked in and went up to the counter with our beer .
no `` thank you '' or `` have a good day '' .
it was a weird experience .
i had a very unfortunate experience with this groomer .
the owner was rude and did not even apologize for the horrible service .
do not take your dog there to be groomed !
at our table and then left prior to ordering .
bad idea .
what a disappointment !
evening started pretty badly and did not get much better .
we had reservations for _num_ people at 7pm this past saturday .
two of us were there early and rudely treated by the hostess .
when the rest of our group arrived ( on time !
she told me it would be awhile .
fish tacos were recommended and were basically fried fish sticks .
service was rough .
long waits and lack of attentiveness .
not sure pino 's will get a repeat visit .
bland food and poor service .
there were no open tables , despite having reservations .
no such luck , since it was prime dining time on saturday night .
pino then literally threw our menu 's at us , and walked away .
not so much as a free drink for our inconvenience .
the food here is ok but not worth the price .
$ _num_ a glass of garbage wine ?
$ _num_ dollars for a plate of pasta , really ?
went here with a gift card from the restaurant week photo competition .
i probably will not return .
listen folks , it 's cold when the sun goes down .
our server was nice , but not attentive at all .
the worst part of the night ?
needless to say , we were disappointed .
the place has changed and not for the better .
though the food was adequate , it 's not the same .
sometimes a liquor license is not the best investment !
we chose an option for each course of the very limited restaurant week menu .
baked eggplant caprese : the breaded eggplant was a soggy mess .
i do n't know where all the positive reviews are coming from .
there was not one thing we ate that was impressive in any way .
all of it was overpriced and below mediocre .
i wasted my money , and i will never , ever go back there .
i do n't really take kindly to people speaking so rudely to my mother .
well , i have never felt more embarrassed in a situation .
i said he was being rude to my mother , a paying customer .
sorry , how can you not have $ _num_ in change ?
very disappointing meal .
salad was average at best .
he kept loudly requesting a credit card and the women did not have one .
after my visit last night , i have no desire to ever go again .
at this point the whole place feels bad for the mother and daughter .
i could n't finish my dinner i was so mad .
sorry , we will never step foot in here again .
probably one of the worst places i have been to recently .
i wo n't be going back .
after _num_ minutes , i left .
when make turns , there is noise from front wheel .
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
take a hard right down aisle _num_ and then you hit the bakery .
_num_ . )
from the bakery , you walk along a long meat wall .
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
you 're not going every which way to try and find things .
the set up is ridiculous .
at night it is a nightmare .
ugh .
walked out without making purchase .
it was like a window into hell .
i will never step foot in that store again .
some are very slow .
the customers do n't make the experience any better .
_num_ cents .
avoid .
employees are unhelpful and rude .
i wanted to grow out my hair longer but it was looking messy .
_num_ minutes later , we were done .
yes , just like a bad date , we were done in _num_ minutes .
it was messy .
terrible !
the cut was terrible !
i have an awful experience .
the eggplant was soggy and not great .
price : tasty is cheap .
atmosphere : typical chinese takeout place .
would i go back again ?
there 's zero ambiance , offers quick take-out and the service is rude .
i ordered the kung pao chicken and crab rangoon .
sadly , they prepared kung pao beef instead .
it 's extremely disappointing to receive the wrong food .
it 's even more disappointing when the restaurant refuses to correct the order .
tasteless food that arrived over an hour after it was ordered and was cold .
not tasty at all .
never received my order and was left in a bad mood .
_num_ .
the sweet and sour chicken was disgusting .
it was a neon pink color and tasted like dried out chewy dog food .
there 's $ _num_ down the drain .
i wish there was a zero star option to give .
first off , everything was dripping everywhere .
the entire bag was a soggy mess .
i 'm not even sure they bothered to cook that .
next up , the `` general tso 's bean curd . ''
the only thing they did n't mess up on our order was the rice .
it tasted and looked like rice .
holy bat balls did this place have bad food !
nothing but flavorless , americanized chinese food .
very kind , gave me minor changes without question .
zero flavor , zero filling , frozen wan tons ?
they most certainly sat in broth for hours .
i could n't even pick them up .
they fell apart .
watery sauce , no heat .
just bad .
the worst part of it all .
see pics of giant balls of noodles that tasted like the burnt curry .
price does n't matter to me at all , though .
it was just inedible .
all noodle , no filler .
avoid if you want anything but americanized junk food .
unfortunately i did not get to experience these things .
the service was slow and lukewarm .
also , no credit or debit cards here .
i also ordered provolone sticks which also did not taste good .
i 've tried a lot of pizza places and this is so bad .
the crust is not homemade , pretty sure .
it was n't very hot either .
i am definitely going elsewhere next time .
this place has the worst service i 've ever seen .
i called in two cold sandwiches and was told it would be _num_ mins .
i had to leave without my order after _num_ minutes .
very inconvenient in a world where cash is pretty much on the way out .
they lost my breakfast business that day .
worst pizza i have had in my entire _num_ years of life .
tasted like sauce and cheese on toast .
i would n't eat this pizza if it was free .
this was one of the worst dinners out i 've had in recent memory .
olive garden seems like fine dining compared to this place .
not the crusty italian bread .
no dipping oil with herbs and spices .
it was _num_ % breading .
i can barely taste any calamari or zucchini .
again , no herbs and spices .
for the entree , i ordered rigatoni and my fiance had baked ziti .
i could n't even taste garlic in it .
what kind of italian food has no garlic ?
service was slow , but there was only one waitress in the restaurant .
she was generally nice and probably embarrassed for serving such crappy food .
$ _num_ , including tip .
even with this voucher i feel like i paid too much money .
this shell station is horrible .
_num_ ) this place is ghetto .
why not ? ''
it 's frustrating because they also do n't particularly need to work hard .
zero effort , and a horrible attitude .
it 's a gas station , how hard can it be ?
it 's clear that they do not care at all .
i 'm never going back , and you should n't either .
do not use their car wash .
this was a big mistake .
horrible experience .
i was rear ended at a stop sign , was n't my fault .
i would n't recommend them to anyone .
called two days later to confirm it was ready .
`` no , it 's not ready yet .
days passed and no call .
left and halfway home , `` check engine '' light came back on .
please do not adopt any pets from here until they update their standards .
!
so now i have a very sick kitten on my hands .
poor little guy .
this also ruins my plan of getting another cat in the future .
bad shelter !
no `` i 'm sorry . ''
they kill more pets for space than any other pittsburgh shelter .
weak leadership .
this is a terrible shelter .
that 's probably how they got so sick !
my poor baby went through hell .
never again will i take my dog there .
she was sick six ways to sunday .
i hate that place and everyone in it .
i 'm very disappointed .
so i have no gripe with the tailoring itself .
_num_ .
so beware , you are paying to dollar !
i was in a time crunch , so paid anyways .
_num_ .
my suit coat came back ruined !
at that point , i had n't put two and two together yet .
so i went back first thing the next day , and showed the tailor .
it makes no sense .
i 'm just not crazy about the vibe here .
let me repeat , never again .
the primary reason i used to visit this store was to fill medical prescriptions .
hence , i am now here , writing this review .
the times i 've been here , its been an ok experience .
however , their store hours are absolutely terrible .
this place is a disaster .
it 's almost been _num_ hours and i 'm still waiting .
ridiculous .
-they did not install tires correctly .
booked an appointment , and they fixed the issue .
i do not recommend .
last time i ever set foot in that place .
i will not be returning in the future .
went in to have a slow leak fixed on a tire .
no one could look at it because they had an appointment at _num_ .
one person working and could n't look at my car .
no appointments available for tomorrow .
fail !
poor service that leaves tenants to fight mildew on their own .
was trying to find a rating lower than _num_ star but could n't .
this guy seems nice but he 's actually not .
something does n't sound right here .
the light fixtures were too modern to be considered cozy .
the people who work here are very rude .
i am not a young hip person and felt very out of place there .
i will not go back again .
a little pricey but whatever .
the sandwich was just gross .
the coffee was just a little off .
no wonder mine was stale .
seriously , all the people here have major attitude problems and need an adjustment .
their sandwiches taste terrible as well , they 've always been terrible .
seriously , fuck this place .
i just do n't get why the floor is like and ice skating rink .
i drink this beer regularly , and something was wrong with the beer .
i 've had the pork nachos and they were blah .
our server was friendly , but not terribly attentive .
i would probably only go again on an all-you-can-eat wings night .
i ate at this restaurant last night with three dining companions .
it is a shame because buffalo blues does have potential .
the sandwich left something to be desired .
buffalo blues was neither .
not particularly interested in returning for any reason .
very classy , wish i could remember her name .
bar food none too exceptional .
we had nachos that were on slightly stale chips .
it was humongous but not that tasty , pretty dry .
bad texture .
it really is a pittsburgh staple but come on ... .
food is really , really average .
it , technically is in shadyside so your mercedes will be safe !
it 's loud as hell !
there seems to be no consideration for customers at all .
but as long as they got their money ; they could give a crap .
want to sit in the bar area ?
also it 's loud as hell !
to put it lightly ; the staff suck !
it pains me to leave any tip for them .
it is way too expensive .
oh how the mighty have fallen .
something happened and the wings are small dry and just generally bad .
since wings are supposed to be their thing this is pretty unacceptable .
food is very overpriced though .
and , its not good .
some of the salads are alright , but its just not good food .
we did n't eat anything so i ca n't comment on the food .
my husband and i went to buffalo blues last night .
after what seemed like forever , my husband got up to find a server .
he literally walked around the restaurant to find someone , but could n't .
when we said no she said she would be back .
such a waste of time .
i hate this place .
so the max you could eat is _num_ wings .
the wings do not come with celery .
apparently this was a bad choice .
however , i hate it because i believe the alcohol and food is overpriced .
so , it 's not really much of a win at all .
unfortunately , the service we were given ruined our overall experience at buffalo blues .
my husband was excited about the amount of beers they had on tap .
the restaurant seemed poorly managed and subpar .
we will not be back .
the food was awful , the service worse .
we ate two each , then told the server we did n't want them .
at least the place was quiet -- there were empty tables everywhere .
and the quality of them are bad .
unfortunately every time i wish i was somewhere else .
the hot and sour soup was ok.
this is an average chinese buffet .
and it all is so bad .
the chicken in the chicken and broccoli was so small and it looked disgusting .
the sweet and sour chicken looked like drops of hard , fried batter .
came back an hour later only to see my car in the same spot .
they said it would take another two hours to start work .
i came in with a flat .
so no , no thank you .
they fixed the flat no problem for $ _num_ .
guess that cracking was n't so bad after all .
you should always have your car washed , specially in the winter .
i was quoted $ _num_ for them to get it off .
avoid this shop .
but after what happened i will never be back .
they just cost me money and lost my tires .
put the tires in my basement , no problem .
they call me up and tell me the tire is the wrong size .
because you could n't fit me in within a day i get screwed ?
every single time i go through the drive-thru i do n't get a straw .
i do n't know how this keeps happening .
i do n't think i 've ever encountered such a miserable bunch of people .
too bad after all these prior good reviews .
extremely rude and condescending over the phone .
unfortunately , i hung up feeling like a major inconvenience .
the sad part about this is they really try .
do n't expect great performances here , expect a talked up mediocre performance .
this apple is too green to eat much less pay for .
my pumpkin pastry with carmel topping was alright .
i also tried the key lime cake and sour cream and apple cake .
while i 've been to better bakeries , i will definitely be back .
if that does n't work , then they try to scare you w/ it .
or the fact that you 'll save sooooo much money by being a member .
granted , it was a friday morning , but still .
and nobody smiled at anyone else .
as i said above : it 's worse than the bureau of motor vehicles .
unbelievable .
it 's been a tremendous ordeal to get it fixed .
another employee tried to help me fix it and screwed that up too .
i do n't quite trust anybody else to help me properly .
there is no option for zero stars so i was forced to give one .
_num_ weeks later , no title ?
for some odd reason , local aaa offices dont post their phone number online ?
naturally , i get an automatic voicemail .
and again naturally , no return phone call .
cant wait until aaa calls me to renew my membership .
Neutral
if i could give negative stars i would .
i should know , i 've dealt with at least a dozen .
times , and it still is not resolved .
why did you return there if you were so unhappy , you might ask .
if you are in the aaa , you 'll know i 'm calling .
Neutral
if i could give negative stars i would .
i should know , i 've dealt with at least a dozen .
times , and it still is not resolved .
why did you return there if you were so unhappy , you might ask .
if you are in the aaa , you 'll know i 'm calling .
worst experience .
slow , rude , unhelpful , and completely clueless .
my soul purpose to coming here was to get my license picture taken .
not here .
complete waste of life .
going through aaa is a bit worse than your average dmv .
the guy who processed our registration was patronizing and slow .
he also made a mistake that required fixing after the fact .
i called aaa and the service and follow-up were both appalling !
so the air in tire was wasted time .
no one has gotten back to me yet .
horrible treatment .
bad facility , even without a trash can in the room .
i never seen such a rude person in this county so far .
seems like she do n't wanted to take care of the customers .
place was a little bit of a disaster .
its easy to be dissatisfied and rant about a customer services organization .
so i drove _num_ hours there on a weekend to renew .
having a _num_ hour drive wasted didnt make it any better as well .
sad to say the other reviews i read of this place are accurate .
there were zero other people here aside from my friend and i .
fish out of water here when it comes to hardware related things .
i feel bad for the lady that works the paint counter .
i 'm certain they notice , they just do n't care .
i came away with none of it .
the staff i dealt with could not have cared less about helping me .
do n't care .
very disappointing to me .
the customer service at this location is terrible .
overall , shopping there is a poor experience .
fairly mediocre , even by the relatively modest standards of home depot .
tried using the online order store pickup with the hopes of increased efficiency .
fail .
i really like this shop .
all the sales associates are extremely useful and educated .
avoid this place .
the employees are nice but i get the sense it 's managed terribly .
it is difficult to get in and out of their lot as well .
they hired people that had to be required to do certain areas correctly .
terrible dry cleaners !
poor customer service .
i will never go there again , and i recommend you do n't either .
they do not take pride in their work .
they also lose things , more than once .
do not take your clothes there because they will damage or lose them .
simply awful !
as promised , they were ready monday after 5pm .
additionally , they did not smell so well .
the worst $ _num_ i 've ever spent .
avoid at all costs !
they 've ruined my clothes on _num_ separate occasions !
i want you to know i 'm not just an `` angry customer '' .
instead of _num_ .
very rude and condescending .
but we did n't have that problem until we left their lot !
and then there was another lady that was complaining about their service too .
do not take your car to midas !
they place no value on customer satisfaction .
furthermore i week later i found my car 's belt system was broken .
i made an appt online for 6pm the following day .
he said no because we didnt discuss it .
seriously how to you mess up a simple oil change appt in multiple ways .
- the usual crap they sell to people because they think they are idiots .
refused all of those .
seriously just do n't do it .
had a _num_ am appointment and was told it would be a hour wait .
the front desk clerk said that it should not be much longer .
slow service and response .
linda is a quite arrogant woman with bad attitude .
not recommend .
provolone sticks arrived undercooked , cheese was fully solid , they tasted okay .
worst pizza i 've had in pittsburgh .
i felt sick before i got halfway through it .
that reminds me - the slices are huge , and are $ _num_ .
sounds like the menu and staff needs to be updated .
i also should have known that i should n't have cheated on my diet .
not sure what on the salad made me feel this way .
but i 'm not liking the effect i 'm getting right now .
i got a chicken noodle soup and he got the seafood calzone .
to say the least , i was disappointed in my soup .
but their pizza was remarkably terrible .
i pay my $ _num_ and wait .
i could n't stand to eat more than half .
went home , made some eggs , and guess what ?
the terrible cheese taste from an hour and a half ago ?
i 'm not making this up .
terrible pizza .
just plain gross .
the crust was all gummy and the cheese tasted like plastic .
gross , gross , gross .
the crust was hard and flavorless .
this was a mistake .
avoid this place at all costs .
never again ... .
how utterly disgusted i was with it .
i spent days on the toilet after eating the pizza .
my appointment was at 8:30 am , i was on time .
i sat in the waiting room until _num_ am .
i waited _num_ mins in the lobby .
not cool !
now i am forced to put in another quarter to finish my load .
and at least i put my cart back .
now it 's just more expensive .
worst parking lot in pittsburgh .
try $ _num_ , for real .
waste of time and money overall .
parking at this particular store is a nightmare .
you treat the employees like dogs - like one level above dirt .
oh whole foods , you are so so very overpriced .
but i just can not bring myself to do my normal grocery shopping here .
you may even get a nasty look , yikes !
Negative
okay , i 'm going to a negative place right now ... .
even though i was only there one time , first impressions are a bitch !
the food : plentiful and too expensive to even think of buying .
all i got was a chopped up piece of crap that was useless .
i 'll stick with trader joe 's for my alternative market , thank you !
it really does n't hit you , until it ... hits you .
it 's why they have parking lots in the first place .
i 'll be honest , i just do n't get it .
i spent a lot , but i was ok with the occasional splurge .
not cool .
overpriced and overwhelming .
i made the mistake of going -- once -- on a weekend .
maybe i 'm just not the kind of person that likes whole foods .
if i could give them zero stars , i would .
then told me it probably did n't start because it was sitting so long .
yeah , that sounds like `` nothing 's wrong '' .
do not bring your car here .
i spoke with brian at the desk who was very polite and professional .
sunday went by then monday went by .
then i had to pay them $ _num_ to get my suv back .
i had to pay them to waste my time and do nothing !
this was not in the lease .
_num_ ) they did not return my $ _num_ security deposit .
they never reached out to me , not once !
i would caution against this rental company .
i 've basically been told i 'm not getting my security deposit back .
that 's not a life i 'm comfortable with .
wish me luck guys .
ridiculous policies and move out fees .
Negative
please take all of these negative reviews seriously because they are valid .
they do everything they can to charge you extra fees .
the management is horrible and never understanding .
hot & sour soup was highly americanized , not very hot or very sour .
did they use the tea pot as an ash tray ?
cigarettes are not a replacement for tea bags !
the current tenant informed me that the roof leaked .
we just turned around and walked out at that point .
i would give him a _num_ start rating .
have you seen the terrible bathroom wallpaper borders ?
the wine list did not include descriptions .
disappointing .
the waitress was very curt and disrespectful .
overall , i just was n't very impressed with the food .
_num_ .
there was no information about this .
_num_ .
food is mediocre at best !
they even screwed my order .
asked for risotto and got some pasta , not sure what .
_num_ .
would not recommend to anyone .
they have to have paid their way into magazines rating them highly !
i do n't get it .
i am upset to report that this tasted rather bland .
i am sad to report that this too was tasteless .
the ricotta was dumped on top and added nothing to the dish .
more frustrating than conversations with the wall .
total waste of $ _num_ bucks .
also , their bar seating sucks .
i ca n't believe all the high reviews .
the food tasted terrible .
if you like casbah more power to you but for me never again .
bill was $ _num_ without tax -- pricey by my standards for this experience .
the new tuna tartare appetizer was the highlight of our night .
we were disappointed with our entrees .
my roasted duck breast with spinach and gnocchi was not hot .
not a good vegan experience .
i again had offended by my request .
overpriced , salty and overrated !
it was really hot that day so it was pretty uncomfortable .
the pasta was a little undercooked and the sauce was ok .
the manager on duty came out to apologize , which i did appreciate .
i do n't think that casbah is my favorite anymore .
no thanks casbah !
we were willing to try again , so we went for dinner tonight .
i sent that back , and ordered the sea bass .
needless to say , i will never return to this restaurant .
- ambiance is nice , upscale , not too loud .
only complaint was that the cheeses were served too cold to fully appreciate them .
- mushroom pasta : again quite rich and salty .
that was n't to be .
i 'm so disappointed .
i would hate to lose this place !
wait time : we had a reservation , so we were seated right away .
not worth the price .
main dish : long island duck - too salty .
it is dark , so do n't expect to take any good photos .
i wish i could give it more stars , but really it was disappointing .
heavy and bland .
the service was also extremely slow .
_num_ minutes to get our bread and _num_ to get our appetizers .
wrong it was smaller portions at a higher price .
i never felt so ripped off .
$ _num_ for one meatball and three bites of pasta .
)
- this really was the standout .
so , i had been wanting to try this place for some time .
it was awful .
anyway , i 'm never going back here .
sub par at best , go to any of the other big burrito restaurants .
this is the worst fucking experience i 've ever had at a wine room .
i am standing waiting for our table _num_ minutes past our time .
i tried the gyro wrap which was also a big disappointment .
sooo wrong .
thank god there were bottles of hot sauce and salt on the table .
the burger and `` spicy '' cajun soup were very mediocre .
i 'm a vegetarian and have lived behind the restaurant for over _num_ years .
every time i have ever gone , the service is awful .
i really , really wanted to like this restaurant .
i 'm not really a messy eater , but come on !
maybe part of the problem was expectations ?
learn from my mistake .
it 's never too loud or aggressive .
the food is inconsistent , but often good .
their food , service , and hours are inconsistent .
owners , please stick to your business hours .
it 's not like you 're open that late to begin with !
... my vote is to just stick with the hours you created .
yes , my food was tasty ( _num_ on a scale of 1-10 ) .
however , from the get go , our host was absolutely terrible .
he did not look us in the eye and was just overall awkward .
to be fair , our assigned server was very nice .
but of course , our food came and mine was cold .
it just was n't anything special .
needless to say , i will not be coming back to this place .
it tasted like nothing .
anything will taste better drenched in gravy .
on top of all this service was n't the greatest .
also they do n't really wash their cups .
it made me not want to drink my water even though i was thirsty .
good idea , but poorly executed food .
for a vegetarian place , there was nothing green on our plates .
worst tofu scramble ever .
days old , cold , hard , inedible .
sent it back and had no time to wait for another dish .
i 've found the service here to be pretty terrible .
sorry storm , you need to improve this .
if both of those conditions are n't true , then go anywhere else .
i 'm still not convinced that this is a vegetarian restaurant .
yep , that description of their `` chorizo '' comes directly off their menu .
but do n't expect that feeling here .
two stars because i really like the drinks here .
this place is a train wreck .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the food is bland .
_num_ .
the service was pretty bad .
_num_ .
i think pittsburgh deserves better .
there are too many decent pizza delivery places around to settle for this .
personally , i was n't having an orgasm over my mediocre pizza .
if not , stay away .
do n't waste your money !
i was pretty disappointed with this place .
the fries were super soggy and the pizza was pretty flavorless .
overall , i would n't go back .
i was a bit disappointed with the pizza i got .
i 'm not watching my weight -- i can handle it .
probably not ordering from here again .
pizza is pretty bland and there is nothing remarkable about it .
the pizza was n't bad , but it was n't great either .
given the relative quick delivery , it was on the cold side upon arrival .
also , i had ordered a fried pickle appetizer .
here 's the catch ... there was no sauce !
they literally just threw the wings in the fryer and delivered it to us .
we tried bbq , garlic parmesan and spicy .
but this gives me the chance to tell you how terrible the cannoli was .
the outer shell was soggy and the filling made me gag a little .
the wings were the most mediocre wings i have ever tasted .
final verdict : most mediocre wings in town !
could not understand what the foreign cashier was saying , made placing near impossible .
rude .
rude .
rude .
they do n't speak english and they do n't understand english .
and they are rude .
also the driver forgot to bring my drinks .
the vet met with us for a very short amount of time .
she seemed tired , and overworked .
Negative
all in all , this was a negative experience .
imho that 's ridiculous .
i will not recommended anyone to ever come here .
i was forced to locate another vet when i adopted a new kitten .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
being treated extremely rudely by reception was the final straw .
thanks , but no thanks .
it is unfortunate .
however , i recently missed an appointment .
it is unfortunate that they have such a rude office manager .
this is not a place that a neighborhood should support .
ugh , my coworker spread open the spinach leaf .
the store seems to be a kind of a ripoff .
there was some improvement for awhile , but it has gotten worse .
they 're actually worse than some large corporate stores in these areas .
just got off the phone with a lady from construction junction .
normally , i have had the best experiences there .
my husband can not go back to construction junction today .
i am able to help move , i just could n't do it alone .
not anything like the pieces on the floor .
just thought you should know .
worst customer service i 've seen in a while .
+ _num_ star because they are finally installing air conditioning .
- the fees are unreasonable for the customer experience we get here .
worst climbing gym i have ever been to .
customer service was a joke .
first of all , the gym in pretty cheap .
even a small crack with a few problems set on it .
the staff was n't very helpful .
it 's poor form .
they are n't rated properly , just easy , medium , or hard .
i would n't go there again .
they told me that they charge _num_ dollars a hour .
the filet was decent but not $ _num_ worth of decent .
it was not flavorful or moist nor worth the calories .
apparently they consider this to be the only restaurant in town .
i imagine less than _num_ % of expensive restaurants today are cash only .
the lamb burger was also overcooked .
very pricey food , cash only , average food .
these people could not care less .
)
ridiculous .
rude , unprofessional , and lazy .
the lady i spoke to was rude and unprofessional .
so when i got back to the office , i went online and checked .
nope , it said $ _num_ for a master stylist women 's haircut .
did n't she have my slip with the card number ?
it was n't the cut .
_num_ years i had this deal going on .
needless to say i have n't been back but would recommend in a jam .
sadly , the professionalism of the front desk never got better .
i was going to have so much done , too !
i 'll spend my money elsewhere !
i waited _num_ minutes and finally walked out .
receptionists were beyond awful .
i booked _num_ style appointments in advance for a wedding .
i waited _num_ minutes while being ignored by the receptionists .
i 'm not paying $ _num_ to get rushed service .
more unbelievable , i waited _num_ minutes to pay for the two services .
no wonder they need coupons for customers .
i did n't stay to find out how the haircut would have gone .
he also went on to give me the fastest haircut i 've ever had .
poor planning .
i will never return , to make any other purchases .
big waste of time and gas .
they do not have ice cream , only soft serve .
wow are their servers just lazy or dumb ?
this place is n't very good .
wo n't be going back .
i do n't understand the big hype over this place .
i 'm also not a fan of soft served ice cream .
a good family dollar this is not !
and they smoke around the food .
water glasses stayed empty for almost _num_ minutes !
ordered _num_ dishes , all pretty average .
i wo n't be back .
service is incredibly slow .
not worth it at all .
once seated , i practically had to beg for a wine list .
the cab was taking forever , so we called a different company .
as my boyfriend was talking with the cab company , a waitress walked by .
despite how great the food was , i wo n't be returning .
so disappointed .
i had a horrible experience .
at that time , i even had a terrible interaction with the owner .
this time , overpriced food and bad service .
this is a bad neighborhood .
i am not interested in ever going back !
not happy about the new staff .
the main reason for the low rating was the service .
that was not fair to her and definitely not fair to us .
sounds weird , but i never felt so rushed in a _num_ hour dinner .
i also did not like that we were seated at a high top table .
the biggest disappointment was the veal chop .
the disappointment was it was over-cooked .
not a spot of pink to be found .
just clear me out and get on with the next one .
crappy place .
i made reservation and still the table was not ready .
i am definitely not going to the place again .
everything else was yucky .
avoid !
i would not recommend working with dollar bank for a home mortgage .
my new goal is to deter anybody i know away from dollar bank .
i was totally underwhelmed .
this place does n't feel clean or inviting .
the decor was junkie and old and cluttered .
but sadly , i do n't see you at all in my future .
i got a fill and a fix because i broke a nail .
i was very uncomfortable the whole time i was there .
one of the nail techs was constantly hitting on me .
i will not be returning again .
they are n't very friendly there at all either .
not a bad place to get your nails done .
too over priced for mani and pedi .
terrible customer service !
but got the invoice three days before i got the estimate .
truly , you do n't need this kind of grief .
anybody that is not would be totally screwed by these people .
the quote was $ _num_ dollars .
one quote $ _num_ , another quote was $ _num_ .
needless to say , i will never be going here again .
my night was ruined thanks to this pizza hut .
i waited _num_ hour and _num_ minutes for my pizza to be delivered .
then when i got it , it was cold !
this is the worst chinese food i have had in a long time .
there were no other veggies or anything .
it was all mushy breading and very little chicken .
i ate _num_ bites and threw it away .
needless to say .
i wo n't be getting one again .
the pizza was bland , tasteless .
crust tasted like frozen pizza crust .
sausage was disgusting .
i do n't know what this sausage was other then disgusting .
why would they want to risk a customer not coming back .
these women are old middle aged miserable employees with no passion for their jobs .
i wo n't be back .
i was absolutely horrified !
if you have any alternative , though , i would avoid this place .
i am definitely not going back to complete the transaction .
do not go here for service on your bike .
maybe i just had a bad day .
this was the worst `` pizza '' i 've ever had .
this is not even worthy of the name .
first bite the crust was almost raw , dense , and way too chewy .
there was no third bite .
the remaining slices got tossed in the garbage .
this was by far the worst `` pizza '' i 've ever had .
!
if zero was an option that is what i would rate them !
they are the worst company to ever deal with all they want is money !
zero if that was an opinion .
this place has the worst service i have ever seen .
he was told that no sorry we are out of hushpuppies and pepsi .
it seems that this is a common experience at this restaurant .
recently it changed ownership and sadly the results are horrific .
not even a simple `` i 'm sorry . ''
needless to say we will never go there again .
and we could have been loyal customers for years to come .
also the ambiance of anthony 's is not the same .
very disappointed .
would n't recommend at all .
the quality was horrible .
the sauce was not a good flavor at all .
i had to wait _num_ hours just for a pick up for this crap .
the pizza bagels were soggy yet burned .
and the prices too high .
biggest waste of money !
i ordered a bacon pizza and breaded mushrooms .
disgusting is putting it lightly .
i threw the whole meal in the garbage .
it 's a shame , what happened ?
that is completely ridiculous .
it also does not help that they do not have beer prices listed .
one star for the ridiculous overcharge .
it was not good .
the hummus was okay , and our main plate seemed to be microwaved .
for dinner , not that great .
even though the groupon included menu items , they do n't have a kitchen .
they can keep the other groupon .
maybe they can use the money to buy some real food .
sales person treated me like i was a very inexperienced .
the owner is very pretentious and rude .
i am never going back to this place .
very disappointed that this is the only photo store in the city .
unfortunately , this is the only game in town .
makes me glad i live in new york city .
they gave me a nice receipt .
one week later i call , not ready .
the following week , they would call me back .
other than losing your stuff , they seem like nice guys .
service and products are lackluster .
overall , not a great choice .
in addition to being condescending , they hung up on me .
actually that is n't quite accurate .
neither one greeted me or asked me what i would have like to order .
she served the beer in a mason jar .
the food is n't fresh .
it was n't pan fried either .
my sides , german potato salad and braised red cabbage , were equally awful .
i did n't have more than a bite or two .
that 's total bullshit .
food was mediocre at best .
bland is the best description .
wo n't be back .
what was set in front me looked nothing like what i was used to .
sadly , i just did n't like it .
i thought it was actually not very appetizing at all .
what i was into was the german potato salad .
i was highly disappointed .
it was bad ... the you ca n't drink it kind of bad .
my husband has eaten there before and was sorely disappointed as well .
i really want to like this place .
it was made from pork instead of beef with frozen peas and carrots .
reuben sandwich was greasy and had little meat .
makes you wonder just how safe the kitchen is .
the restaurant is located in a tired part of town .
for starters , the food is always served cold .
do n't believe me ?
yesterday they were undercooked , gritty , and gross .
in fact , all of the food is becoming gross .
you need a new chef , immediately .
if you want bland tasteless food , then stop here .
they need to get out of the _num_ 's with the decor .
beware of the ketchup .
then , they did n't even do anything to make it up to me .
not even the potato pancakes tasted good .
i 've had better meals at the complimentary continental buffet at the holiday inn .
who knows how long that sour cream had been sitting out !
my water glass had onion pieces in the bottom of it .
not a fan of this `` german '' place .
simply awful .
very low quality food for the price .
the only good part was the bacon , which was ok at best .
i have not a single good thing to say about this restaurant .
the service was terrible , took _num_ min to get a water .
we ordered the turkey reuben that tasted funky on day old potato pancakes .
we also ordered max 's famous reuben , nothing famous about it .
worst .
everything ready in _num_ seconds because it sat under a heat lamp .
avoid at all cost .
potato pancakes taste like they had vinegar in them .
disappointed .
it should n't be this way .
if this is personalized service , i 'd rather stay at a motel .
even without grumpy old man , there 's nothing special about this place .
everything else was sub-par .
the dining room breakfast was served in was tacky and the coffee awful .
the hotel is in a bad neighborhood .
ugh .
about _num_ % more expensive .
why even keep this historical , old , dingy , dirty room ?
i was very specific when i made my reservations several months ago .
but , hey , i can always catch up on my sleep tomorrow night .
just bad service overall .
no one to help with bags morning or night .
even the day front desk person was short with us and rude .
i could n't wait to get out of there .
i would n't stay here again .
we never got a call about the reservation time which was annoying .
then refused to call m & p to talk to the manager .
i have terrible foot pain and can barely walk .
very disappointed that i can not be seen sooner .
do not believe he cares about his patients .
horrible food , horrible service .
the italian and mushroom steak hoagies were n't that great .
the steak was so chopped that it kept falling out of the bun .
the pizza was n't that good either .
$ _num_ for _num_ '' italian and $ _num_ for _num_ '' mushroom steak .
i will not get anything from there again .
it was like getting a shitty breakfast in a local sub dive bar .
ron 's pizza palace is cheap .
on multiple occasions in the past , i have ordered hoagies from ron 's .
the produce in their hoagies is as bad as their salads .
i wo n't be ordering from ron 's again , despite the inexpensive menu .
with ron 's , you are better off considering fast food .
inconsistent again .
the last _num_ hoagies i 've gotten here is again only mediocre .
the bread is the best part , which is really sad .
was going to try the buffalo pizza .
no longer going to try .
and ... i was pretty underwhelmed .
fortunately , i 'd gotten that info when i ordered .
would i have had to call in to sort out their staff 's mistake ?
and the food itself certainly left a lot to be desired .
no such luck : it came on her sandwich just like everyone else .
i really do n't know how this place got any good reviews .
i got food poisoning and was so sick .
needless to say i refused to pay for them .
the 4th time my friend dragged me there , i had a salad .
it sounded like she described a bad breakfast joint ... '' oh that place ?
at this point , i am done .
its just sooo unprofessional and annoying .
so dissapointed and will never use them again .
this week is the 3rd week .
estimated delivery time _num_ minutes actually delivery time _num_ minutes .
pizza hut , a pizza of last resort .
estimated delivery time from an online order : _num_ min .
do n't bother with delivery here .
this is the worst location .
_num_ .
_num_ .
two hours and i 'm still waiting on a slow sunday night .
really bad service !
food is ok but horrible delivery service .
they called on the wrong number despite we have given the right one .
horrible horrible service .
small , overcrowded , unfriendly staff .
the food is okay - typical italian fair that could be better seasoned .
the shrimp and pasta , however , were cooked well .
the mozzarella was unremarkable , deep friend mozzarella in breading .
of course it was good , it is fried cheese !
but it was nothing special .
prices were inflated for a limited valentines day menu .
never again , they are off my list .
if i could give this restaurant a zero , i would .
do not go to this restaurant !
their food was mediocre at best .
i will not be going back .
went for the first and last time tonight .
$ _num_ corkage fee for _num_ bottle of wine .
the restaurant is so small and they have a problem with managing customers .
the food was less than average .
we ordered an app and unfortunately this is where our problems began .
they brought mussels instead of our mozzarella sticks .
but this was quickly corrected .
but unfortunately they had already sold out of the special .
i give them a _num_ for presentation .
so i guess i did a good job at picking out the wine .
but did nothing to make up for it .
soups could have been a bit more full in the cups .
the worst thing about this place is also sam .
the only redeeming quality is the young girl who works here .
does not honor national sub day offer .
too late to back out .
this giant eagle maybe the worst supermarket i 've ever been to .
worst grocery store i 've ever been to .
to make it worse , they are supposed to open at _num_ .
one thing i like about the store is the proximity to my house .
it 's close to my neighborhood , hence the _num_ star .
but seriously , it 's like walmart stuff at whole food 's price .
but overall the store is way too pricy - for no good reason !
when i want to cook pretentious gourmet food , they have every ingredient ready .
my recommendation was to burn this place to the ground .
the produce is not very fresh and the meats never looks good .
the store never looks very clean .
however , the quality of the produce from my experience is pretty poor .
the lines are always long and take forever to get through .
furthermore , the stuff in the bakery and goodies are below par .
i 'd recommend stopping in another giant eagle if you can .
i 've had a lot of bad experiences at this store .
i talked to him for _num_ minutes and he was polite and friendly .
such a shame about this place .
the store itself seemed really outdated and stinky .
waste of time .
i dont even bother coming here anymore .
all bad news .
went to this store today and it was worse than usual .
i 'm too scared to shop there after dark .
if i could give this place zero stars i would .
i wish the north side had another option but we do n't .
giant eagle should be ashamed of this establishment .
if i was _num_ i would have beat his ass over that .
like who goes from _num_ 's to _num_ 's in _num_ days ?
horrible customer service !
owner takes no responsibility for ruining clothing .
they had a dj so there was a cover of $ _num_ - boo !
for those that know me , i 'm not the gambling kind .
it was n't overly crowded which made it easy to get drinks .
saturdays there is a cover for the dj which was $ _num_ .
however some folks were smoking and the bathrooms were gross .
my jacket took a few days to air out the smell of the smoke .
_num_ .
_num_ .
for some reason two drinks came out to $ _num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
however , i ca n't let this slide : your claw machine is bullshit .
that 's a lot of beer for less than _num_ dollars .
the worst customer service ever !
i normally do n't do this but i 'm so disappointed .
if you care about your natural nails , stay away from this place .
i do n't eat at this restaurant very often .
i 'm glad i do n't eat at this restaurant very often .
i really was n't thrilled with our meal here .
the breading was much too heavy and you could barely taste the vegetable .
the pasta was cooked well and the sauce was fine though .
i hope the owner or general manager reads this .
service is mediocre and slow .
waitress was ok in attitude .
that 's _num_ minutes to be next .
manager embarrassed himself .
how hard is it to do chicken marsala with mushrooms , seriously ?
the penne ala vodka was sauteed canned tomatoes and no flavor .
the service is terrible .
i do n't know if they hate working there or hate serving people .
why be in the service business if you have a bad attitude ?
i have been here a couple of times and it does n't change .
i 've never had a staring contest with a hostess before .
it 's bizarre .
so if you 're a horse you wo n't go thirsty .
this was ridiculous to us so we left !
ugh , i hate this place .
people from work drag me here to lunch more often than i would like .
the service is snotty and slow .
the food is forgettable and the menu sparse .
i tried the seared ahi tuna .
but do n't go for the menu .
otherwise , food and prices are not worth a stop .
it is n't a bad experience .
maybe it 's just the built in crowd .
crab fries , naturally .
was n't the best either .
service , small selection and mediocre food .
ca n't comment on any other time but this really hectic one .
not a degree above room temp .
limited menu .
my reuben tasted like eating a salt stick .
service was fast , but the salad and cup of soup were disappointing .
the chopped salad had weird cheap ingredients like celery and carrot .
but let me tell you , i was highly disappointed .
first of all , our service was awful .
but now i 'm weary of the restaurant all together .
i was meeting up with _num_ other people there .
not even to just get drinks or an appetizer ordered .
i ordered a hamburger with fries for $ _num_ .
very disappointed .
it took over _num_ minutes to get the order .
the meat was very dry and falling apart but not over cooked .
awful place , to bad i was looking forward .
we only wish we would have ordered food and then left .
try as he could , he could not do it all .
a party of _num_ , we agreed to sit _num_ and _num_ .
i was wrong .
no chicken .
not even one piece .
no potatoes or any other filling except a few peas .
extremely disappointing .
service was slow for soup and a salad .
mediocre at best .
went to easter brunch , was served some coffee from a can .
i do n't understand how this place is even in business .
if this establishment were to be in any other city they would be closed .
this place is a fusion of olive garden and red lobster .
was n't very busy which was a plus .
did n't matter that our food was n't correct and our drinks were empty .
bathrooms were dirty and ladies room had no toilet paper or soap .
service is terrible and wo n't return .
i was really excited to hear that they had smoked salmon .
however , when we got there the buffet was well picked over .
i was mostly wrong .
the food was not great and not worth the price at all .
it came out of the kitchen with noodles instead of the potatoes .
but that should be explained by the waitstaff when someone orders the meal !
we also waited over _num_ minutes before someone even took our order .
going downhill ... ... man , what happened to this place ?
unfortunately our waiter was not up to par .
it is difficult to get under my skin .
house salads for the wife and i which were pretty standard .
we also got a chicken ranch flat bread and this left us disappointed .
that is $ _num_ month from august to march .
they probably knew we would n't have the money for a lawyer .
we spent $ _num_ on admission & parking for _num_ adults and _num_ kids .
we will not be back .
we feel like our money was wasted .
the only downfall was their delivery time .
good food , but rude service on the phone and in person .
i tried pickles tonight for the first time .
i called ahead to order a gyro calzone and was told _num_ minutes .
it was another _num_ before i got my food .
in a bad frame of mind , i tried my food .
i did n't have an issue with the place or the other patrons .
from the food to the prices , you could n't find better .
i 'm thinking we 've struck out .
first of all , ordering was strange .
wow ... we 're we disappointed .
the crust was super doughy and the cheese was pretty gross .
do n't do it !
the bones are small and barely have any meat on them at all .
they do n't take debit or credit cards .
never open when you need it , unreliable availability with his products .
you disappointed me .
i have been a steelers fan as long as i can remember .
so not cool steelers !
my friend lives near here so i came to satisfy my deli sandwich craving .
it was bad .
it made me kind of sad .
o my pittsburgh pirates .
i warn you dear pirates -- it wo n't be pretty .
another losing season .
but was a winning season too much to ask for ?
you also used pay phones because you did n't have a cell phone .
i 'm no fair weather fan , but 20+ years of losing is enough .
what a disappointment .
they topped off my coolant for free and changed my oil .
he asked me if i had $ _num_ cash on me .
i ai n't going back where they treat customers like that .
which is pretty sad .
was so excited to get your pizza today .
very disappointed in the quality of what i got .
how sad is this so not happy .
used to be the best i 've ever had .
wise guys is your typical off beat pizza shop .
there are no frills , there are no items i would particularly recommend .
there are other better pizza places in the area .
the hostess was incredibly rude directly off of the bat .
it was just as lousy as the lunch .
unfortunately , the second visit was n't any better .
the place smells of smoke .
gross .
walking on it with shoes on disgusted me .
the walls have wall paper torn off throughout the place .
do n't get the salmon or tuna steak .
both tasted very fishy to me .
mashed potatoes are not made from real potatoes .
do n't get them unless you are looking to eat boxed potatoes .
i get it , you wan na have a mom and pop shop .
apparently with this kind of reception , no one wants to pay full price .
mom and i both ordered the fish sandwich with mac n cheese .
overall , it was a larger than average portion for a good fish sandwich .
the place is dated and could use updating .
her first bite she made a sour face .
my son and i then tasted it ... understood the face after that .
the pasta was overcooked and the shrimp just sort of were there .
the breaded shrimp tasted weird too .
needless to say , none of us finished our food .
for a $ _num_ dollar meal , it was n't worth $ _num_ .
no , just no .
they told a driver must have taken by accident .
terrible .
ordered twice in the last _num_ days and both times it was terrible .
both were crappy , at best .
staff was really rude both times .
he just said `` sorry man '' and did n't offer any solutions .
it would 've taken very little effort to fix it for us .
too much cheese on their pizzas , and the customer service is incredibly poor .
it 's a shame .
all it would have take n was a new pizza and wings .
$ _num_ a week plus gone from them .
she claimed they did n't deliver to his address which was _num_ mile away .
remember , the call was on speaker so i overheard both sides .
my friend was not rude , not disrespectful , just looking to order food .
hard to contact .
walked off the job and all the work completed was not done properly .
also , alcohol in the air here too .
very disappointed .
original post written september _num_ - i do n't recommend this company .
poor quality work .
i would never use them again .
very disappointed .
delivery was late , our gyros were cold and fries were soggy .
this was probably the worst gyro i have ever had .
ok atmosphere drinks are overpriced for the area .
it was so dirty i could barley contain myself .
the staff completely ignored it .
this is a gathering place for human garbage anymore .
check my purse , yes , but leave my purse with complete strangers ?
it just left a bad taste in my mouth .
years and years of spilled food / blood from the meat department and etc .
had a friend who went here .
the owner is the one who took my appointment .
they are a hot mess .
i came in tonight ready to buy a bike .
i was really disappointed .
the only people getting help in there tonight were two other guys .
what a terrible experience .
i 'm glad i took my money elsewhere .
disgusting & totally unsanitary imo .
i 'd go back for bottled beer , that 's about it .
i hate writing a less than stellar review of a business .
this is where i get a serious case of the sad .
the bartender working seemed annoyed by our presence .
it happens !
that 's sort of disappointing but still fine .
the owner refuses to take care of black people .
not sure what people see here but it 's a never again .
it was busy but at times could n't find her .
i had an ugly haircut .
for $ _num_ with the owner .
this time around i am extremely upset .
karen left the color on my hair way too long .
the worst of it is the damage caused by being over processed .
i would like to say that i am only disappointed by what 's happened .
i very much regret ever trying this salon .
when i arrived , i was seated quickly and greeted by a stylist .
what a complete waste of time .
they told me it was it was because i was booking with the owner .
i 've had appointments with salon owners and never had to leave payment info .
i was not a fan and probably wo n't be back .
this was my second visit and alas , my last .
as for my ca rolls , the avocado was all brown !
avocado is like banana .
not wiped down in a long while or perhaps ever .
needless to say , we skipped dessert .
our first visit deserved a _num_ but this visit was a _num_ .
i was not impressed with the sushi either .
i would not recommend this place .
always seem to be people going in and out .
the shrimp lo mein was ok but the shrimp was overcooked .
the moo shu pork was forgettable .
yeah , do n't order from here , unless it 's for dumplings .
everything else we had sucked .
shrimp and scallop with garlic was bland as hell .
i only took _num_ bite and did n't want anymore .
the wonton soup i have to say though was very good .
the chicken lo mein and fried rice were okay .
nothing special .
the price was fair and the delivery driver was nice .
i probably wo n't order here again though .
horrible food .
it 's hard to get a good chinese restaurant around pittsburgh .
person on the taking orders was rude when i called back with a problem .
this place has ok food and bad customer service .
terrible .
no .
she refused .
a completely clueless one , that 's what kind .
she simply said `` ok '' and walked out of the room .
meaning , i never saw her full face .
or maybe i 'm wrong .
the answer , so bad !
it 's all cheap but that 's not reason to be terrible .
only once was it under par .
how about horrible customer service ?
long time customer and disappointed to say will not buy from them again .
absolutely horrible way to treat a customer when they were the ones in error .
apparently they feel that frozen cakes are acceptable for events .
thanks for the disappointment to me and my son !
this place is the worst motel i have ever stayed .
this was the worst hotel that i ever stayed in .
i was afraid to sleep in that nasty bed .
horrible place !
pretty rough , but not completely unbearable .
the location is n't ideal ; on the side of a busy highway .
the overall condition of the hotel was n't promising on first entrance .
the room continued to be unimpressive .
- no visible signs of bed bugs .
probably not .
it 's dirty and weird .
the free breakfast is as bad as it gets .
( old cereal and bread . )
i fall into the later category : i did n't like it at all .
the salad was ... nothing short of horrific .
eventually , i found bland tomatoes and shredded iceberg lettuce hidden far below .
i do n't get this place .
sorry , but our pizza was cold .
and the garlic wings did n't taste like garlic .
some customers may like it , me , not so much .
they put oil on the sandwich , but no other dressing .
i expected a nice tangy flavor to compliment the meat but was disappointed .
my date ordered a hot sausage hoagie .
the bread got soggy and the darn thing fell apart .
it looked more like tomato soup with sausage than a sandwich .
the dining room is also a bit cramped .
hungry patrons also are constantly getting up to visit the soda fountain .
this was just bad pizza .
for the money i expect that the toppings will be cooked on the pizza .
also the mushrooms were out of a can .
do not waste money here .
i guess a lot of people like it , and more power too them .
but i do n't get it .
way too much cheese .
the pizza crust tasted like pizza hut .
i did n't even know you could get canned green bell peppers .
if answer is yes , then maybe this place is for you .
it is definitely not for me .
this `` pizza '' was the worst food i have ever eaten .
i do n't get it .
cold cheese and cold pepperoni on my pizza ?
why does pittsburgh have to be so weird ?
no professionalism .
_num_ cents per slice for every topping ?
not a medium .
no way .
a ton of cold shredded cheese thrown on top of pizza ?
no no no .
no beer either .
whoever recently took over , should be ashamed .
worse than store freezer pizza .
terrible .
, i would have never known .
had this pizza been cooked , i feel like it would be subpar .
i would n't take somewhere here as a pittsburgh destination though .
did n't live up to my expectations at all .
waste of time and money .
it does n't work .
man was this place packed !
however it just does not work for me .
rude .
if i could rate it zero stars i would .
i ca n't understand how this place stays in business .
i disliked the cold cheese and cold pepperoni on so so crust .
not comparable to the other top ten pizza joints in pittsburgh .
i really wanted to like this place but alas it just was n't happening .
they put way too much cheese on everything .
i know , you say , how can one possibly have too much cheese .
totally my own fault , but still , watch out .
went for lunch for hoagie , fries and _num_ cuts .
would n't recommend .
he employees walk by dirty tables then people sit at them .
my daughter and i ordered my pizza slices to eat in and hers togo .
after finishing mine , we inquired about our take out .
what they said was `` i do n't know what you 're talking about .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
terrible experience !
stay away unless you 're just buying tires !
very disappointed with this dry cleaner .
i do n't normally get my beer from there .
small dark not very opening or friendly place .
will not be returning .
the only good thing was free parking out back .
had n't even read the reviews beforehand .
it was karaoke tonight , not my fav but whatever .
mediocre and poorly made !
i would give this eat n park location zero stars if i could .
i did not receive water or any service for _num_ minutes .
do n't waste your time .
it 's fairly disgusting ( sticky tables , trash everywhere ) .
dairy queen only serves two flavors of ice cream so this is fairly unacceptable .
we tried to explain this and the clerk said nope , not allowed .
if i could give this place less than one star i would .
but the customer service is by far the worst i have ever experienced .
i would never give these people my money again .
this is by far not true in this store .
the service is rather incompetent .
it would have been nice to know whom .
ca n't understand the big secret about that one .
it is still in plastic and there are no burn marks .
i was grateful for justin since he was the most helpful to me .
so consider my advice if you decide to purchase here .
this was done _num_ years ago .
i ca n't believe this place has n't been reviewed .
nothing more , and nothing less .
my girlfriend and i came to have some dinner around _num_ pm .
sadly , this was the last time that she ever came to our table .
we sat and waited for more than _num_ minutes .
will i come back to your restaurant , i 'm not sure .
it went to voice mail , so i left a message .
support local businesses , but make sure they are deserving of your money !
atmosphere is awesome ... food is terrible .
no flavor , soggy french fries , over sauces wings .
_num_ minutes later my date had finished his meal and my fries were gone .
my breakfast burrito tasted like nothing and a our food was cold .
the only good thing about the experience was the warm donuts .
poor service , crappy food .
overall not the way a restaurant should be run .
i would give this place half a star if i could .
the service was the most appalling i have ever experienced .
do not order steak or prime rib here .
the prime rib , ordered rare , was medium , dry and extremely salty .
the rib eye was thinly cut , salty and dry .
the bill was $ _num_ so it is pricey .
i was very disappointed and would not order anything but wings here .
the fourth got his about _num_ minutes later and his food was terrible .
cold .
stale .
then , she sat _num_ small parties there .
bad idea .
this place is a bad idea all around .
lots of tv 's and ok atmosphere so i will squeeze out _num_ stars .
very disappointed in this place .
we are never going back .
this place is sad .
but all of the pretzel bun sandwiches are n't that great .
fishy smell .
not fresh at all .
also did n't seem very nice .
very annoyed and ignorant !
!
this place is empty ... .
and _num_ bbq dishes .
not hot at all ... .
server kim was awesome .
but kitchen has a lot of problems .
the variety of sauces is what gets me to come back .
i 'm sure it would have been great !
the gravy ( breakfast gravy ) was warm , however everything underneath was cold .
i am not exaggerating in the least .
anything dealing with food is a train wreck .
i may come to have drinks , but never to eat .
you 've been warned !
if i could less than a star i would .
service was extremely slow to begin with .
go figure cooked , but cold .
they ended up making a new one and the wait was over _num_ minutes .
one minute later all of our food was delivered cold .
it 's also really expensive .
it 's not worth the money .
the place had a great location but otherwise it 's a waste .
it was a place where everybody knew my name .
i would always suggest it when friends asked me where to go .
i can not speak for others .
all that money spent elsewhere because of one power trip .
will never go back !
asked to refill my coffee and got a cold one .
unbelievable .
average bar food , slow service , a nice selection of incredibly overpriced beers .
go to the original pancake house about _num_ minutes away for a better breakfast .
pancakes were not very good .
average wait time to be seated and for food to arrive .
very small and uncomfortable .
dont fall for it .
especially waitress was lack of enthusiasm .
such a waste of time .
i think we waited about _num_ mins , which was n't bad .
our waitress had n't stopped by our table in a long time .
no hint of a smile on her face .
are we really hungry or really impatient ?
i dunno .
maybe the waitress was having a bad day .
everybody told me i had to try and their pancakes .
well , the short stack they served me were lousy pancakes .
i do not get the hype behind this place .
it was just average and did n't really have any taste .
it came with mashed potatoes which were definitely from a package .
the worst part of this last visit was the service .
after standing there for a couple minutes we were then given our check .
i wo n't be back .
i stopped in on a whim alone and sat at the counter .
i did not finish my meal and got up and paid and left .
i am not sure if i will go back which is really a shame .
i ate less than half of the meal and left .
i would n't go back .
urban spoon rated _num_ % favorite .
this pizza is not good .
the hype surrounding this place will probably lead to your great disappointment .
i would n't order a pizza from them again .
now it 's just crap .
not a dime every again .
almost three days later , i had n't heard back from them .
my biggest issue was the attitude i received when i called .
so he ca n't bother with mine .
i would n't recommend this mechanic to anyone .
having curly hair , i 've had my fair share of terrible haircuts .
the one i had at this salon was among the worst .
the owner clearly has no idea how to cut curly hair .
it all could have been so easily avoided .
it does n't feel fair .
not nice !
i am not impressed .
mediocre food service and atmosphere .
bland reheated samosas .
barely reheated naan .
obviously that feeling is long gone .
clearly she had a nasty cold and should 've stayed home that day !
i 'm not sure what was worse food or service .
oily , greasy and bad taste .
shockingly bad .
the young waiter was ok but clearly scared of the woman .
the old woman was not nice .
that said ... for _num_ people , my lunch tab came to $ _num_ .
for an appetizer , _num_ entrees , and naan .
no drinks .
so , i will never be back .
which is sad , really .
i wish i could give them _num_ stars ... total waste of money .
food was so bad that i threw it in the trash .
hope no one falls sick after eating food here .
food was terrible .
all tasted like old food .
hope no one falls sick after eating food here .
also the food was bland and pretty much flavorless , very disappointing .
needless to say , we will never return !
severely disappointed .
i ordered chicken curry .
this place is pretty bad .
the food is n't fresh .
terrible place to eat and not very clean at all .
_num_ $ for a plain roast beef forget that !
i was desperately hungry late one night with no other options .
my guess is that it was that suspect sauce you put on that sandwich .
i ordered two chicken finger kids meals and two adult meals .
had to pull forward and wait another ten minutes for food .
when i got home they did n't give me my kids meals .
the place is crowded and cramped too , but not unpleasant .
sadly really went downhill .
the bloody mary was pretty awesome for what i assume is a pre-made mix .
i also got a grilled swordfish salad which was bland as hell !
iceberg lettuce , croutons , cucumbers , and dry swordfish .
lame .
she also split a small mushroom pizza with my dad which was above average .
hostess was very awkward when seating us .
i just feel like i 've had much better pizza elsewhere around town .
one of the worst steak sandwiches i 've ever eaten .
everything is basic with a large price tag .
rude , unfriendly , just a miserable male server .
there were _num_ of us .
it was juicy and smothered in bleu cheese .
unfortunately , the hair did not stop there .
luckily the waitress did not put up too much of a fight .
however , the reaction that we received was unacceptable .
very disappointed in our delivery order this evening .
the wedding soup was less than fair .
thee buffalo chicken sandwich had no lettuce or tomato on it .
the reuben and fries were soggy and greasy .
it was a disgrace .
disappointed .
worst waitress ever .
could n't remember anything .
husband ordered penne chicken vodka sauce .
it was runny and bland .
would not go back .
the same plain pizza we order never seems to taste the same .
the fries were ways very soggy and cold .
i want so badly to like this place !
but the last three times the staff has been awful .
horrible drink ( old fashioned ) ?
spaghetti -- huge amount , no taste ?
noise level -- painful ?
i 've been wanting to stop in here for the longest time .
pizza , sandwiches , beer , what could go wrong ?
well , it was n't horrible but it also did n't blow me away .
all in all , very disappointing in our book .
delivery guy was shady too .
i did n't bother to ask if anything was organic .
i do n't like this place at all .
i do n't recommend at all .
no apology or explanation , just a bad attitude .
however once opened not so much .
Neutral
i wish there were negative stars i could put for this place .
i have never been treated that way with any owner of a business .
unbelievable .
as it is right now , do not patronize this business .
there was absolutely no excuse for his attitude .
got a bang trim , a low # _num_ cut , and a wash .
i showed the lady the picture of my desired bang .
she went ahead started to cut my bang after looking at it .
are you kidding me ?
and i replied , `` no , i 'm sorry .
it 's not what i was looking for , but thank you '' .
this is the worst company as far as billing & customer service are concerned .
when you try to cancel it takes forever and they are rude !
* no shopping carts .
salad will come first , then a couple of dogs , then fries .
now , their service : really lackluster .
the waitstaff all seems to think highly of themselves .
hardly saw any of that today .
fries are nothing special .
the worst part , though , is the service .
you practically have to beg the waitresses to pay any attention to you .
and i do n't even mean refilling your drink .
however , check the price of a beer before you buy it .
but not $ _num_ for _num_ standard size dog good .
not a good value in my book .
probably wo n't be back .
shame on me .
check out the better business bureau ( bbb ) .
are you kidding me ?
we were leaving to go _num_ miles away the next day for the wedding .
now , after picking up my dress we realized they ordered the wrong size !
the size that i ordered required zero alterations .
after calling every day for a week i was furious .
he barely let me talk and continuously spoke over me .
the downside : the alterations were very expensive and very poorly done .
awful customer service !
she was sooooo rude .
a voice from downstairs says `` i 'm down here . ''
she then starts up the stairs and says `` no go upstairs . ''
and then she said `` no , what kind of dress . ''
she took me into the room of dresses and said to look around .
they ca n't even give you the courtesy of trying on their dresses .
so i had high hopes that my _num_ ( ! )
but getting to that point was one disaster after another .
then , in june , my maid of honor calls me .
but it was not the dress she ordered .
not even close .
fast forward to july ( _num_ weeks before the wedding ) .
she said there was no time to order another dress .
no time to get additional fabric .
in the end , that bridesmaid got a partial refund for the dress .
this experience was not worth the beautiful dresses .
save yourself the headache and stay away from this establishment .
worst dry cleaners ever .
also , the staff was fairly rude and all had chips on their shoulders .
the owner ( larger woman ) is rude and dismissive of my questions .
i wo n't be coming here again .
turned out to be way more hassle than it was worth .
i left them as i was not in a rush .
this was during business hours that i was told to wait outside .
these people are totally incompetent .
i would n't trust them with a pair of socks .
do not use these people for your dry cleaning needs !
unfortunately zero stars is not an option .
there 's a reason why there are only two reviews currently for this place .
shame on you cathy !
Neutral
let me start off by saying , i hate the dentist .
it is my worst fear .
and for $ _num_ that 's disappointing .
what i got was dry and totally tasteless .
the whole burger just tasted like nothing .
it was accompanied by some typical frozen steak fries .
again no salt or seasoning .
rather disappointed .
i met my friend jean here , she is a once a week customer .
i chose a veggie wrap , sans cheese with a side of apple sauce .
she complained the tea was weak , i never noticed .
so why my low score ?
waited _num_ minutes for drinks , _num_ minutes for good .
food was average , service very bad .
never going back .
finally order and pull around , i wait another five minutes .
all i can really say is that she was a real ball of sunshine .
the drive through service here leaves something to be desired .
not only was my order wrong but the lady was very grumpy .
the service is bad and the attitude of the workers is worse .
worst service .
slow .
bad !
real bad .
i want to know what to expect , you know ?
)
they do n't use their space well .
it just looked really sparse .
this is a depressing coffee shop .
there 's no smoking inside , of course , but it always happened .
i guess that is really the only thing this place has going for it .
tables are often dirty .
dirty tables , i agree with the other reviews here .
no additional fans , nothing .
i asked for my money back .
you know what was the worst thing , though ?
then the ultimate insult : _num_ kids came in selling candy bars .
well , that coffee i spent $ _num_ on ?
that is the last money i will spend in that place .
disgusting .
does chicken salad hold a week in your fridge ?
i would beg the owners to put any effort into this place .
i asked for a pen , not a kidney .
yeah , i 'm not coming here anymore .
_num_ ) they use canned whipped cream .
_num_ ) my hot chocolate was just gross .
is it possible to give zero stars ?
this place has gone downhill tremendously .
its _num_ and they still do n't take credit and or debit cards .
but they use the cheapest meats they can find and you can taste it .
pizza was fine but nothing special .
the salad i ordered was wrong , though .
and beware of the prices : what 's on the website is wrong .
this store is so gross that i was almost sick !
i will never step foot in this place again .
i really do n't get giant eagle .
he told me i had about _num_ minutes to get it .
i informed him i had about _num_ minutes .
i left my intended purchases and walked out without buying .
no reply .
six days and it cost _num_ dollars .
just terrible .
just go elsewhere .
not even remotely convenient .
one of the worst wendy 's i 've ever experienced .
did n't get all of the items i ordered and paid for !
we also did n't get straws , or utensils for our food .
nothing special , it is kmart after all .
it is dirty and the employees are lazy and exceptionally slow .
needless to say , i will not go here again .
are employees required to be grumpy here ?
they all look like they hate their job .
first off , i like family restaurants and avoid chains when possible .
the managers do n't care .
then she gave it to us before thinking to ask if we wanted another .
just go anywhere else , it ca n't be worse !
nothing special .
worst applebee 's experience i 've had .
we were seated and then waited _num_ minutes to even be greeted .
and then it was only because we flagged someone down .
no apologies when we were finally taken care of .
should have listened to my gut on this one .
but i did n't have a problem with that .
what i have a problem with is all the nasty flies in the building .
and while you 're eating too ... it 's so disgusting .
as far as the menu , i was n't impressed .
but i ended up with the chicken broccoli alfredo , nothing to rave about .
another overdone steak and utterly inattentive staff !
still sitting here waiting for someone to give a care .
i said no thanks .
takeout is a mess at this location .
very awkward location and atmosphere .
i keep giving them another chance and i keep getting disappointed .
it 's just rolls off the tongue , does n't it ?
i hate complaining like this .
but sometimes , you just have to , ya know ?
when she delivered their food there was not a single mention of the delay .
from start to finish , the entire evening was a terrible experience .
there are better hibachi options in the area .
the service can be okay or awful .
but she said no , we absolutely could not order ice cream separately .
very disappointing .
we love japanese steak houses and this was our least favorite meal in pittsburgh .
the salad dressing was tasteless , the jumbo shrimp was under cooked and chewy .
it tasted more steamed than hot grilled .
the shrimp sauce was very thick and not that flavorful .
this is by the far the worst hibachi restaurant i have eaten at .
not only was the food bad but the service was terrible .
this is the worst hibachi i have ever had .
not good .
my boyfriend ordered tofu and it was cold in the middle .
i replied `` no , you never served me any . ''
by the time they were cooked , everyone was finished eating .
that does n't say too much for the rest of them .
i do n't know how people keep coming here .
there is way better hibachi in pittsburgh , for a lot less money .
benihana is not worth your time or money .
by now its nearly _num_ o'clock .
by this point we 've been waiting for _num_ minutes .
this is totally unacceptable .
the horrible location ?
the hostess that had little to nothing to say prior or during our seating ?
as we get our 2nd batch of sushi our soup was still not ready .
looks and taste both scored a _num_ out of _num_ .
the horrible location ?
the hostess that had little to nothing to say prior or during our seating ?
as we get our 2nd batch of sushi our soup was still not ready .
looks and taste both scored a _num_ out of _num_ .
fist we wait _num_ mins or so to be seated .
the restaurant was n't even half full .
our hibachi chef was absolutely horrible !
he barely spoke and did n't put on any kind of show at all !
our _num_ year old was so bored that she wanted to leave .
none of us even like onions .
the manager did n't seem to care at all about our situation .
we feel completely cheated .
since the changes its just awful .
very sad .
sometimes i ate there _num_ or _num_ times a month .
w h at a shame .
i just hate to see it .
extremely disappointed , food was absolutely awful .
our vegetables were so soft , they all tasted the same , mushy .
our chicken was flavorless and rubbery .
this will be our last trip here as there are now much better options .
it 's too bad a once gold standard restaurant is not any longer .
went for a friend 's birthday and had the worst experience ever .
no explanation , no apology , nothing .
the presentation of the food was awful .
compared to other restaurants this is my least favorite .
this is the worst hibachi restaurant in pittsburgh .
the food was cold and everything was flavorless .
the salad and steak sauce tasted like cleaner .
the chicken was also extremely dry .
this is place is no longer what it used to be .
also , they did n't have much of a sushi menu at all .
it was really disappointing .
the place was completely empty .
i was mortified , my boyfriend was mortified , the waitress looked mortified .
my brother was uncomfortable and embarrassed and just kept staring down .
he should n't have been put in that position .
shame on you benihana .
dirty place and horrible service .
loud is an understatement .
it took forever to get our drinks of simply water and soda .
what we got at long last was so disappointing .
there is much better mexican food and drink in the 'burgh .
you have no idea how badly i want to like this place .
i just have n't been impressed by anything i 've ordered there .
even the chips and salsa are n't terribly good .
even the guacamole was too hot .
it was very noisy and i do not recommend for kids .
the chicken fajita was over cooked , dry , and charred .
everything was overpriced ; drinks , entrees , and dessert .
the waiter was horrible and barely checked on us .
the food was also not too good .
it was very bland and did n't have a lot of taste to it .
i will not be coming back .
the food is n't terrible , but not impressive .
there was nothing memorable about the taste of it whatsoever .
been here a few times now , food is mediocre at best .
it 's hit or miss with this place , but mostly a miss .
the food was okay , but worst service ever .
i was really hoping that this place would have good food .
i ordered _num_ ground beef tacos with black beans and rice .
the tacos were decent but the rice and beans were horrible .
both were very dry and lacked flavor .
horrible service .
it was loud , but expected that on a friday night .
bartender came back quickly with what looked like watered down lemonade .
worst margarita i have ever been served !
described as being served with butternut squash , brussel sprouts and cauliflower .
did n't even get time under the warmer .
glad i tried this place but wo n't rush back .
sorry , bummer .
service was mediocre but the food was poor .
burnt chicken in the burrito .
there was no mole sauce as described in the dish .
this was explained to us before we ordered .
this restaurant has really gone downhill over the last few years .
have n't been here in a long time because the service and food suck !
that was one of the worst burritos i have ever , ever had .
never again mad mex south hills !
waited _num_ minutes for drink , waitress got my order wrong .
not worth the trip .
i am a ten minute drive from this location .
i attended the sushi class on monday night .
for $ _num_ per person , i was beyond disappointed .
can you give a company zero stars ?
this place makes you feel unwelcome and dumb .
just a poorly laid out store which is showing it 's age .
not laid out well .
rude cashiers .
self check out usually broken .
horrible experience more than once .
store is too small and always crowded .
managers and workers are rude and condescending .
actually just had an awful experience with a manager named chris .
i have witnessed him being rude and condescending to other customers too .
had a beer and an appetizer , so-so .
huge line at mad mex on friday night , none here .
i doubt we will go back , too many other choices .
was n't the best experience .
the food was ok but nothing to great .
not up to it 's previous brunch standards .
ugh .
if you 're not getting that , do n't bother .
at eat n ' park , free cookies are a staple .
needless to say we left , and we will not be going back .
i wish i could give this no stars !
this place was not packed .
while waiting , i used the ladies restroom .
does n't anyone come and check this ?
came back and dropped them off and left again .
your menu is n't that big !
however , there was no way i was sending it back .
i did n't even eat all of it .
i gave half of it to my husband to eat .
the fries are very salty .
rude !
either way , i am not going back to find out .
high prices , horrible service !
i only went here because i had a groupon .
huge mistake .
off to sams ... .
model cleaners failed to deliver _num_ shirts and _num_ suits in june .
after a few phone calls later , no shirts , no suits .
so , i am assuming they were delivered by a neighbor .
i then took inventory of my suits and found that _num_ suits are missing !
i will be doing business elsewhere .
so incompetent i did not even get a chance to rate the actual service .
we went for a second opinion elsewhere and i 'm glad we did .
guy on the front desk has the attitude problem .
the people all look like they hate their jobs and treat the customers accordingly .
i threw my mean in the garbage .
this wendy 's is terrible .
there 's nothing fast about this fast food .
at first i thought maybe it was a fluke .
- and they left me hanging .
but based on other reviews , even this is n't always the case .
received bad service today .
however , lots of seats since the place was empty .
we left einstein 's because it was crowded .
they missed an opportunity to impress a new customer .
repeated my order _num_ times and it still got screwed up .
my dad would always take me to this place when i was little .
Neutral
i usually do not like posting negative reviews .
poor service , menu options not available , dirty utensils .
instead of the amazing tomato bread i got plain rye .
if your seeking genuine medical attention i would strongly suggest another facility .
no lab coat , no name tag , no introduction , no nothing .
i asked if he is a doctor and she replied , `` no .
their service is terrible .
i was ; however , charged for the basket .
do n't order from this shop if you want a timely delivery .
the food was cooked well , but lackluster .
have mixed vincent 's .
just goes to show , it depends on what you order .
overpriced , very slow service , food was decent .
food is mediocre service is lousy .
i was disappointed with the seafood salad .
of shrimp and _num_ scallops with very little salad greens for alot of money .
service was good but probably the worse pizza i 've ever had .
we could n't eat it .
waitress was nice but never asked to refill our drinks .
my hoagie was dry with min meat .
probably wont go back .
pizza was good but really expensive .
i also got a _num_ pack that cost _num_ dollars .
the same _num_ pack cost _num_ back in my hometown .
i dont eat meat so i ate the spinach ravioli and it was ok .
breadsticks and meatball sub for my mother .
the breadsticks were sitting a in pool of oil .
the meatballs sub , my mother said was cold and undercooked .
it was n't fresh at all .
we finally got our money back , we did n't even eat the food .
and the service just was disappointing , all for take out .
when i was little there was always enough donuts for everyone !
they know they sell out before _num_ and they only open at _num_ !
everyone hates it ... and unfortunately i drive it frequently .
as mentioned by others , this road is not in the best shape .
and this is n't even the halfway point to philly .
and there are n't as many rest stops .
fyi - prices are scheduled to go up jan _num_ _num_ .
surprisingly what remains seems to be doing good business .
kmart is doing okay as is the giant eagle .
that 's not an eatery either .
i soon left and went over to olive garden for lunch .
dead malls are sad , for some reason .
walking through this mall just creepy though .
truly the worst mall in america .
going here is like being in a time machine though .
man , the rent has to be so cheap !
honestly i do n't consider this place a mall .
stay away , there 's nothing here to see .
this mall is dead !
the mall that is nearby is not really a mall .
even the atm was boarded up , which is really not a good sign .
there are also not many place to eat around the hotel .
i hate olive garden .
you wo n't find me at an olive garden back in new jersey !
i ordered food that i believed was gluten free .
within twenty minutes i started to have symptoms and was sick for two days .
avoid at all costs !
ever !
thats as american as fortune cookies .
after pasta , comes the protein , that includes meatballs , then finally salad .
i just passed six tables empty and clean .
their salads and breadsticks are the only real reason to go there anymore ... !
well it is a sunday night and the crowd is not here .
very unprofessional staff so far .
her ex must have ran , not walked away from her .
rooms were clean and the amenities were fine .
my problem is that the hotel double charged me for my stay .
i only stayed one night and was charged twice .
add on : the wifi is awful .
no manager on duty for the busy morning rush .
they are not concerned with quality of courtesy services ie shuttle and breakfast .
employees watching reality tv during business hours really puts me off .
the next morning we went down to the front desk again .
something just feels wrong .
avoid .
place is ok but a little uncomfortable .
the continental breakfast was ok but a little lackluster .
so this spot is like mad cheap but really ?
checkin was seamless as it should be .
the first bed legit has hair under the sheets ... strike _num_ .
you could n't at lease have made it look like you did your jobs ?
i assumed it was leaking and brushed it off .
there was absolutely no hot water for my shower .
so cold i would n't even consider hopping in really quick .
i was so mad .
i 'm not sure i can even give this place one star .
furnishings and bedding from the _num_ 's ... if not _num_ 's !
the hallway looks a wreck !
the tv was definitely a _num_ 's model .
there are no hotel signs ; _num_ ) .
there were no parked cars visible from the road ; and _num_ ) .
it looked like one of those service elevators that the public never sees .
this was by far the worst hotel experience i 've ever had .
the lights were broken and the room was filthy .
the worst .
do not stay here .
Negative
wish i could give this place negative stars .
it begins with no signs saying where the hotel is at .
really wish i would have looked at yelp before booking here .
extremely disappointed .
she could n't tear herself away from the movie to address me .
filthy would be a step up from the actual conditions .
it has n't been cleaned in months .
i explained to her that this has been going on for weeks .
yet again , not one courtesy call , nothing resolved .
i wish i did n't have to give even _num_ star .
horrible service .
i got home and no extra sides .
i called again on july 2nd as they never sent anything .
i would be happy to get my _num_ back .
mediocre food , horrible service , zero follow through .
my advice , avoid this place .
junk worse than mcdonald .
horrible experience again made sandwich wrong for 3rd visit .
store is open until 2:00 .
she asks employee to scale back .
he refuses .
never again will i go to this location .
horrible service !
_num_ time in the row i got my order wrong .
which i do n't really need .
today i gave them _num_ chance .
for real , wasting money for wrong order !
it 's sad .
today both girls behind the counter were so rude and had zero personality .
service is terrible .
waited for _num_ minutes for a bagel with cream cheese with no line .
they other employee was doing i do n't know what .
it should n't take _num_ minutes to get a dozen bagels .
horrible service and food .
horrible customer service and they always screw up our orders .
i just do n't understand why they 're so lazy .
it 's not hard .
extremely long lines , and poorly trained staff .
do not recommend .
the baristas are not friendly .
i 'm always always always made to feel like i 'm stupid ( seriously ?
and they 're just rude .
rude .
real bad .
not like the delicious aroma of fresh brewed coffee .
no no .
and it smells like a coffee shop should smell - like coffee .
it is not daily normal , ordinary dirt .
not sure if the manager makes th e employees clean or not !
would rather go to dunkin donuts next time !
it costs $ _num_ for a manicure and $ _num_ for a pedicure .
the worst mani/pedi of my life .
i 'm _num_ .
she had no clue but claims to have been doing nails for _num_ years .
did n't know how to remove gel polish .
did n't file straight or smooth .
did n't clean under my nails after lotion .
unfortunately the worst possible thing has happened .
unfortunately i do n't know what happened ?
i 'm no longer going back .
i know some people have off days but this was bad .
by far the worst shellac manicure i have ever had .
i went down on my lunch break for a quick mani .
first the woman rushed through my `` manicure . ''
the manicure was very quick and not at all thorough .
if i could give it _num_ stars i would .
i really should have known better to walk in here .
it 's the size of a closet , completely messy , and disorganized .
but you know how some dive bars have charm ?
i was thinking this place might be like that .
i sat down in the chair for pedicure .
that 's not how it 's done in philly .
woman takes off my toe nail polish .
should n't you be doing this for all of your clients ?
shady and terribly run nail salon .
surprised someone has n't been hurt yet .
this is the worse nail salon i have ever been to !
when i said something to her about it , she snapped at me .
she was unprofessional and downright nasty .
this place needs to be closed - stay away !
unfortunately , i did not have the great experience others did .
i ended up getting probably the worst haircut i 'd had in _num_ years .
additionally , the experience at the salon left much to be desired .
something that was supposed to be a treat for me turned into a headache .
the haircut was mediocre , but the highlights were much worse .
they did n't even cover up all of my roots !
i really was sold at one point .
therefore , that left junior stylists to wash and dry my hair .
so please , i trust you to just make me look hot . ''
i hate that !
i 'm not a hair stylist .
we called to make appointments together and the receptionist was rude !
different people wash and dry your hair .
what i got was about _num_ inches taken off and no layers .
wrong !
first , i feel like they pull the prices out of thin air .
finally , overall the prices were way too high .
my husband gave me a gift certificate for this salon .
there were two girls at the front desk , neither could have been bothered .
one did n't even look up from the computer .
she offered me two different stylists by name with no other information .
that 's why i 'm looking for my cup now .
rude .
why did n't i have to show some email to get the free treatment ?
she was basically giving my asian friend a terribly difficult time .
my hairstylist was friendly but gave me a really bad haircut .
very disappointed .
will not return to this place .
once again , they were not prompt .
please do not patronize this business .
i wish it was n't that difficult .
the salon itself also disappointed me .
in addition , they offered me tea , coffee , or water .
however it wasnt until half way through my appointment that i got it .
such a waste of time and rude .
i should have known better given that it only had one positive review .
i wandered in here looking for a pedicure .
my heels still looked as bad as they did when i walked in .
very sloppy !
i would put _num_ star if it was possible !
it looked like a child had done it .
this guy is out of control its definitely something wrong with him .
also a heads up - only _num_ pedicure chairs in the place .
very limited color selection .
very poor quality work .
got a full set and the exact same thing happened _num_ days later .
they must use very cheap product to lower their costs .
pedicure 's are overpriced and they do basically nothing .
it was no more than _num_ minutes long .
do not waste your money .
i 've gotten my nails done quickly before though and had much better quality .
the staff is the most unfriendly and have a carefree attitude .
this is not the first time either .
stuck in my lease until february .
is it terrible ?
no , but you know that better is out there .
the blackened chicken wrap was boring .
the flavor was missing and the entire meal was just bland .
also , white tortillas just do not do it for me .
however , i can order a salad with french fries on it .
ca n't win 'em all , right ?
ridiculous .
but , it is what it is so do not forget your key !
other times , it does n't seem so busy .
a number of the reviews here giving off the `` eh '' vibe ?
finally - a halfway decent tv setup , pittsburgh !
my boyfriend ordered a chicken stir fry and i got a cheddar burger .
he said the stir fry was so-so .
ingredients were spot on , but it was lacking any real flavor .
it was just so-so .
my food was plain and boring .
the place was noisy and it was pricey .
well , it was overpriced and the food was terrible .
i ordered the chicken parm pasta and got it to go to my room .
very bad food and overpriced .
i wish i could give this place no stars !
no tip for you my friend .
especially considering the french dip was so boring .
no redeeming qualities here .
it was hardly edible .
i did not , however get the best .
although i would have to say the pretzel bite appetizer was n't bad .
but i really do n't think there 's much you can mess up .
the buffalo pierogies however , was a total miss .
it did n't look appetizing , nor did it actually taste appetizing .
food was flavorless , plain .
do they even have tables for _num_ ?
_num_ minutes later ... he asked his manager and allowed us to sit there .
no steak knife , no mashed potatoes , no asparagus as ordered .
will not be back .
pirates , steelers , penguins etc ?
they do not have 1/2 price apps !
somewhat slow service and somewhat overpriced .
$ _num_ burgers , $ _num_ domestic bottles .
look elsewhere there is a lot surrounding this place so you have options .
we waited for the server yet again after asking for drink menus .
absolutely nothing arrived in a timely manner .
and all of that was on a night where the place was mostly empty !
the nachos were the worst i 've ever had .
noisy overcrowded and not enough staff to cover the crowd so service was slow .
the lobster bisque was bland and cold .
the pork chop was so bitter and dry .
furthermore , it took forever just to get our waitress 's attention .
i would rather go get sushi than spend more money here .
i was disappointed the waitress did n't say anything either .
unfortunately , our experience was dreadful .
our food tasted frozen and overcooked .
what has not changed is the extremely poor service .
our meal basically met our admittedly low expectations .
all working hard , but covering too many tables .
long story short , i wo n't go back .
she thought the potato side was just so-so .
hotel restaurants are just awful !
would n't they want you to stay and spend money on their property ?
nevertheless , this place in the westin hotel is no different .
for starters , the place is sorely outdated .
the decorations look like they 're straight out of an _num_ 's music video .
the spicy yellow tail was not spicy .
the salad 's ginger dressing was awful and watery .
but it was not happening at this place !
and def not as good !
it was hardly halfway full .
so she asked for a little more from the server .
needless to say , i will not be back .
do n't say i did n't warn you !
the portions are not worth the price .
the service has been poor almost every time i went .
the salads are small and nothing to write about .
came in for drinks after a conference and could not get service .
do n't waste your time at the fish market .
_num_ dollars for _num_ people .
it all had no taste !
the steak was tough and tasteless .
there was too much rice , and presentation was sad .
service was the only redeeming quality .
a simple `` sorry for the wait '' would have been nice .
unfortunately we did not .
the food was all bland and tasteless .
it was not even blackened .
mash potatoes were dry and tasted gritty like it came from a box .
do yourself a favor and avoid the original fish market .
a round of patron margaritas were horrible .
fish market needs some lessons on hospitality and diversity or new management .
terrible crab bisque .
the food was awful .
do not waste your money at this restaurant .
seriously , terrible .
just all around terrible .
it actually hurt my eyes to look at the table it was so bright .
i 've been meaning to go back to the fish market for so long .
i finally had the chance last week and was surprisingly disappointed .
both were not unique in flavor or presentation .
ugly .
ugly .
ugly .
i was pretty disappointed by this experience .
it was n't good at all .
it was a small roll cut into _num_ pieces ( maki ) .
so i know it 's an off the shelf thing .
basically , this was the worst roll i could imagine .
so all-in-all , the food was sub-par at best .
i 'm sure the room service would have been better .
to be fair there was n't anything particularly wrong with the food or service .
but the quality just does n't match the price .
first time i 've eaten here i went during lunch time .
not crowded but service was quite slow so i took off a star .
you 're probably asking why order that when at a fish market .
no worries probably better for me .
so they lost another star for over priced for the value i received .
the girlfriends sushi meal was a bit over priced for a lunch menu .
two basic rolls and miso soup for $ _num_ .
this would easy go for $ _num_ at other places during lunch .
yes , but only if it is convenient .
i would not go out of my way or tell friends about this place .
did n't eat here ... this review not about the food .
we immediately left and frankly its not worth going back again .
shame , the fish was good there .
crappy hostess for sure .
it does n't change much .
they get maximum money for average seafood ( or anything else ) .
the miso soup was barely average .
sub-par sushi .
no greeter so we were n't sure where to go .
the rest was dry .
it was disgusting .
she however did not offer to comp the meal .
we sat down for lunch after checking into our hotel room .
not good .
the food was ok , but nothing special .
it 's a shame b/c better service would have made the experience decent .
go somewhere else for lunch , there are many better options in the area .
the food on the other hand - absolutely horrible .
so disappointed with this place !
the menu was pretty random and everything we tried was really average .
the drinks were n't anything special either .
never been before and went on a thursday night at 6pm before a show .
i 'm sure it is in the liquor license application .
not my scene whatsoever !
super bad energy in this place .
i did n't even say goodbye to the friend who had brought me there .
smoke bomb disappeared !
she knew i would hate it but just did n't want to go alone .
i was pissed .
the night was not lost .
i am not saying that people who like this place are any particular sort .
thats pretty lame for a downtown bar just because they were not packed .
extremely disappointed .
i 've been going to this bar randomly over the last _num_ years .
it 's definitely gone downhill .
there were maybe _num_ people around the bar .
but the attitude of this place could be better .
the menu was small and underwhelming .
the flatbread pizza most likely came out of the box .
obviously , if you choose to patronize this establishment , pay cash .
the guys here were borderline rude to me when i dropped my car off .
so really it was n't a terribly difficult job to be done .
i could have saved a lot of money and time and done it myself .
wo n't come again to this place ... .
do n't bother .
it was boring and flavor free .
oh , and the grocery store wine was way over priced .
food was fine , wo n't go back for fear of the server .
while here , we sampled the blueberry mojito and the cucumber basil martini .
the blueberry mojito had an overpowering taste of rum .
however , the rum killed any blueberry or mint flavor in the drink .
the sole basil flavor of this drink made it unappealing .
ok , i 'm in !
i figured wrong .
well hell , what was your first guess ?
i ordered some turkey wrap with a fruit salad for a side .
i say `` some '' turkey wrap because it was really that unimpressive !
when it did , it looked ok .
it was very disappointing .
however , i 'm mainly rating their food and service .
in fact , i could n't finish it .
we both threw down a brew nasty , paid and left .
unfortunately for olive or twist , the visit would probably be our last .
my biggest complaint is the drink prices .
it 's somewhat upscale , but it 's not the ritz .
owner or manager was very rude when we presented our yelp deal .
this bar is cramped , overpriced , and the service is unbelievably slow .
seriously , avoid this place .
very disappointed .
it was frustrating .
unfortunately , they were very disappointing .
her potatoes were ice cold and sandwich luke warm .
thankfully i just dislike tomatoes and it was n't an allergy issue .
there was also no pineapple chutney .
overall , very disappointed .
but the positives stop there .
neither one of us ate more than _num_ chips .
completely bitter and disgusting !
do n't go here for anything but the walls and music .
we both got martinis and the nachos and buffalo spread apps .
my first impression was the outdated decor .
the restaurant has carpet which i find off putting .
the food was mediocre .
visited with a party of _num_ last weekend for a friend 's birthday .
can you say awkward ?
we went back in the main door , clearly confused .
the bartender looked at us but kept pouring drinks ( rude ! )
we were seated , and had to wait awhile for service .
i was too drunk and full of pita donuts to eat my dinner .
the two bites of my pork belly sandwich were pretty alright though .
this time was not so good .
no problem , we were seated right away .
anything to acknowledge an unacceptable wait time .
we did n't get anything , and that was a little disappointing .
not a fan of the service .
it literally killed me to leave a tip .
guess the men at olive or twist only like men .
$ _num_ bill and it was n't good at all !
the customer service displayed was some of the worst i have ever seen .
the food was underwhelming at best .
no acknowledgement when we arrive .
asked to leave my card at the bar .
never came out to see how we were doing .
worst service i 've received in a while .
i would n't go if you are of flavor descent .
i asked the waitress ... did n't this come with the mango salsa topping ?
why did n't they do that in the first place .
maybe it 's nostalgia for the cigar but i thought he looked ridiculous .
there 's a reason it cost that , because it was n't very good .
the sauce was disappointing .
i would n't come here for anything .
we 'll feed these to our dogs when we get home .
avoid this tourist trap !
first time in pittsburgh , from chicago .
_num_ .
no one seems to know how the public transportation system works .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
why do i need to request a stop on the `` t '' ?
oh , pat buses , why ca n't i quit you ?
why does n't the schedule know this ?
i was _num_ minutes early for the bus i was trying to catch .
i can understand a delay during rush hour , but this was not .
for shame !
i do n't even really know where to begin with this review .
well , it does get one from point a to point b in pittsburgh .
there 's no day pass .
i have been riding the bus for as long as i can remember .
anyway port authority to sum it up , is a hot damn mess .
one year after they cut that route after being there over _num_ years .
its only been in new york and dc for years !
getting on and off is confusing .
when to pay is confusing .
the service is n't frequent enough .
the subway system only goes to one neighborhood from downtown .
the buses smell like urine .
sucks , sucks , sucks .
on an _num_ degree day one buses heat was on full blast .
not the drivers fault .
buses are late all the time .
port authority sucks !
they have the worst transportation service ever in pittsburgh .
they also cut back bus services and lay off all these bus drivers .
pathetic !
pittsburgh is known for their worst transportation !
the bus number is _num_ .
i wish someone had informed the port authority of this .
_num_ . )
singapore had this for their buses in _num_ !
_num_ . )
some drivers can be surly or just downright ignorant .
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
i waited two hours today in the freezing cold to get to work .
had to call off it was just to cold out !
considering the size of pittsburgh , the bus system here is actually pathetic .
so why not actually make a decent public transportation system ?
finally , drivers range from super friendly to scary or just rude .
one , quite literally , threw a guy off of the bus for me .
it varies bus by bus , time of day , and more .
* wasting over an hour of my time .
big league cities need big league transportation .
_num_ stars ?
what i found most annoying was the uncomfortable seating .
okay , i 'm not from pittsburgh .
nothing was dry ?
half my dish was potato .
there was seriously nothing remotely healthy on this menu .
nothing raw , nothing green , nothing fresh , not even as an ingredient .
_num_ fights broke out while we were there .
anyway - i wo n't be heading back anytime soon !
avis customer service says we have to wait _num_ hours .
thanks for starving us avis and making us sleep in our cars .
i rented a car with this location as the drop off point .
i signed all paper work and returned the keys .
i became very angry .
worst customer service at this place .
no grace period or understanding at all .
she was as useless as a tsa agent .
why did n't i get paid then ?
i 'm not from here , so maybe i do n't share the love .
i probably wo n't be back ever again .
i thought the turkey was slimy and tasted weird .
totally not worth it , unless you just go for the fries and drinks .
unfortunately , this place is pretty dirty .
make sure no flies land on your food .
unfortunately , i learned this the hard way .
i recently ate a _num_ oz cheeseburger at a local burger joint .
that was the worst meat that i have seen since junior high school .
we would have been much better off at burger king .
worst sandwich on earth .
oh primanti 's , you always disappoint !
_num_ these guys can never seem to cook their fries properly .
_num_ the bread .
maybe we just went to the wrong primanti bros location .
gross !
many people told me to go here and i was totally disappointed !
okay on to service ... everyone seemed like they hated their job .
it was really , really , not good .
so i guess if you want an authentic pittsburgh experience then go here .
i do n't care to ever go back and will tell friends to avoid .
in philly , they 'd be out of business in a heartbeat .
a native sent me here , an apparent pittsburgh landmark .
what i got was a very dry and tasteless sandwich .
service was indifferent , at best .
my first time at primanti bros in pittsburgh , pa .
i was not impressed with my sandwich there .
i think with some mustard this might have been great .
it was dry .
after sitting there and being ignored for _num_ minutes we just left !
rude , arrogant , and just nasty .
i do n't blame it on the servers but whoever manages the place .
when i told people i was going to pittsburgh , everyone recommended primanti bros .
it was a big sandwich , but the flavour was not amazing .
i also ordered a bowl of chili which was too spicy for me .
i do n't like coleslaw .
you 'll get a sandwich with soggy fries and coleslaw on it .
the sandwich at best was mediocre .
apart from that , i do n't know why you 'd return .
2nd experience , today , equally as awful .
their fries are also soggy and gross .
the sheer size of it all was just too much too .
the concept is n't that ridiculous either .
just get fries and coleslaw and put it in your sandwich .
the only flavors were vinegar and pepper .
( did i mention they tasted like old fryer grease ? )
the sandwiches were fine and were inexpensive .
be warned that everything here comes with french fries , even the salads .
they are soggy and tasteless , maybe the worst i 've ever had .
half the sandwich falls out while your eating .
ordered a grilled chicken salad , take out .
i only go there when dragged by coworkers .
lack of flavor really hurts them in my opinion .
it really takes over and you hardly taste the quality of the other ingredients .
i really do n't know what the hype is about .
i was quite underwhelmed with this restaurant .
but then two waitresses kept coming and going without even looking at me .
i immediately wanted to send it back but the waitress was gone again mia .
she just disappeared again .
i waited as long as i could but she never came back .
until then she was just missing .
i had to walk inside to get my check and then pay it .
i was really annoyed .
i no longer have to carry around my terrible , terrible secret .
to be honest this place was not that good at all .
the sandwiches , although unique , were not that good .
it was all french fries and very little meat .
what a disappointment .
maybe my expectations were just too high , i do n't know .
previous reviews have said it well : lackluster , tasteless food .
boring sandwich .
so , why such a low score ?
the service was terrible .
have n't you been to any restaurants , like , ever ?
sit back down and i 'll take your order . ''
it was unbelievable .
utterly , totally unbelievable .
the chicken was like tasteless rubber .
i ca n't for the life of me figure out why all the hype .
i was warned by others that this is mainly where tourists eat .
but i 'm a tourist here , and wanted to try it .
it was a sandwich mostly of slaw and fries .
the thick white bread was dry and boring ; too crusty .
he gave me big time attitude and commented that i took it apart .
and that , sir , is why you got a $ _num_ tip !
they left off the tomato that supposedly comes with each sandwich !
nope , wo n't be back .
disappointed , big time .
the sandwich was soggy , bland , and just all-around not good .
i did n't get sick from it , so that 's a bonus .
go to meat & potatoes instead , and order a sandwich there .
tonight was my second attempt here .
not even an acknowledgement from the wait staff .
no more tries here .
to compare this place to the famous sandwich places is nyc is a joke .
if you like sandwiches with french fries piled on them , go for it .
but no good sandwich needs nonsense like that .
i was really looking forward to a huge tasty sandwich but was greatly disappointed !
everything was bland , nothing had seasoning , not even basic salt .
however , they only have two waitresses outside for about _num_ tables .
it took _num_ minutes to get our drink order .
our waitress was very rude and did n't make me feel welcomed at all .
it 's not fair for the customers or for the servers .
_num_ stars for history , _num_ for food quality and flavor .
in total about a 30-40 minute wait from arrival to food .
if you do n't have the time just go next door to the subway .
i stand by my decision : pass .
she came back _num_ minutes later , with the beers and took our order .
when we did finally get our food , it was ice cold .
i had very little meat in mine , and more coleslaw that anything else .
'
why the hell are you in such a hurry '' .
had such high hopes for this place on our visit to pittsburgh .
worst service ever .
can i give this place zero stars ?
gross . )
this place was trashy , dirty and probably not even up to code .
my first visit was to the one in south hills .
waited _num_ mins for _num_ sandwiches .
the coleslaw is gross and i 'm a fan of coleslaw .
this time i got the grilled chicken salad .
the chicken was tasteless and rubbery .
it , however , did n't work for me .
it 's not much of a cheesesteak .
i ca n't hold it against them though .
i chose poorly .
this sandwich shop lacks all of those things .
highly disappointing .
bland .
service good prices cheap but food very bland and pre made .
coleslaw was a lot better with the hot sauce i smothered on it .
the beer makes everything tastes better so order at least two beers before eating .
i 'm not a big foodie but i like my food taste better .
the market square location has the most horrible service i 've ever experienced .
horrible !
will never return to any location !
service was bad .
highly disappointing philly cheesesteak !
first , we were disappointed by how many places were closed on a sunday .
the only reason i 'm giving it two stars is because of the bread .
i asked if she had pbr , and she replied she did n't know .
ok then , how about i just have a diet pop .
before she ran off , we ordered our meals .
and then just stood there waiting to write my order down .
it was just strange .
of course , the order came out quickly , and wrong .
getting those taken off was another huge inconvenience to our poor server .
my aunt picked up lunch , and left the tip .
outside of the bread i ca n't say it was memorable in any way .
basically , this place is like dr. pepper soda .
people are crazy about it but that thing tastes extremely ridiculous .
ok , i get it , your busy .
so , after all was said and done , my sandwich was just ok .
nothing to write home about .
sorry , i guess it 's just not my thing .
i do n't care for primanti brothers .
the sandwiches are n't bad , they just are n't great .
the main ingredients just seem to be lacking in quality .
my other issue is their restaurants are all filthy .
i 've been to _num_ different primanti locations and each one just seems greasy .
place sucks .
this was after waiting 20+ minutes at the register with cash in hand .
rude !
not worth it .
very bad foods .
very bad service .
they were rude .
i do not recommend this place .
that being said , this place was not good .
firstly , the food had no flavor .
that has nothing to do with our party size .
the only seasoning available are salt , pepper , hot sauce , & ketchup .
big disappointment .
neither i nor my husband understood the hype about this place .
we 'd probably never go back .
i do n't understand the hype with this place .
the sandwiches they serve are gross !
super dry and no good flavor other than the cole slaw .
the only thing this place has going for it is the local hype .
the coleslaw lacked flavor and the bun was simple white bread .
the fries on the sandwich added no additional flavor .
hate slaw but tried it with slaw anyway .
nothing special .
way too much coleslaw .
def split it and get ice cream for dessert somewhere else .
only good part was an outdoor concert going on just outside of it !
for both sandwiches , the bread used was extremely bland and borderline stale .
the veggies were about average , not fresh , but did n't taste gross .
essentially , the entire sandwich was inedible and i settled for five guys instead .
nothing special .
so , i got a turkey sandwich with the coleslaw and fries on it .
too many fries on the sandwich .
oh , and like _num_ slices of meat and a slice of cheese .
i 've been here three times and it 's been inconsistent .
they really overload the sandwiches with coleslaw and french fries .
i end up picking half of my sandwich apart .
it looked pretty awful like a hard , dry , high school cafeteria lunch .
i would n't recommend this place .
we ordered the `` pitt burger '' and boy was it disappointing .
the burger is dry and lacks flavor .
the bread was the worst part .
ugh .
trust the reviews , it 's not worth the wait or the money !
it 's just bad .
the servers are polite , but extremely inattentive .
came here after a _num_ 1/2 drive expecting the best sandwich i ever had .
the sandwich sucked ; no flavor , no excitement .
and the beer menu was mediocre , at best .
on the other hand , the fried pickles were great .
and the wait staff were awesome .
also , parking was shit .
my advice : locals must not know shit from their asshole .
this place really did suck .
i sent it back - showed the gal my burned pastrami sandwich .
she has an attitude and reluctantly made me a new one in _num_ minutes .
for the most part they were rude and inattentive .
it is not .
disgusting .
guests always mention they ca n't wait to try go here .
i dread it at this point .
wrong .
never going back .
for one , the service was terrible .
the food sucks .
you will leave smelling like cooking oil .
and their beer selection sucks .
horrible customer service !
but the dipping sauce for the tots were on point .
there is very little meat on the sandwich .
service is n't that great either .
for all the hype this was very disappointing .
skip it .
not a fan of the french bread .
wo n't be coming back after this visit .
i am visiting from california and was very disappointed with the service and food .
it was all bread and coleslaw .
the waiter was not nice at all !
each time , i ask myself , `` why am i going back ? ''
it was grilled chicken , french fries , a little cheese on chopped lettuce .
the bread is _num_ % of the meal .
not so much .
my friend got an italian sub that was ok .
skip this place - there are other decent cheap eats downtown .
upon entering you are immediately greeted by pure chaos .
the service is horrible ... friendly but horrible .
i ordered two double cheeseburgers and waited over twenty minutes for them .
this mcdonalds is straight crap .
the staff does n't seem to care .
he make sure that all of the customers incorrect orders are made correctly .
they sit on tables and often just sit at your table .
he make sure that all of the customers incorrect orders are made correctly .
they sit on the tables and often just sit at your table .
i think this should be more like _num_ stars .
the preparation instructions seem questionable ( microwave in a plastic bag ?
being from la , i was disappointed with the tacos .
unfortunately , it was not as good as i hoped .
the cashier had no idea what we were asking for .
... can you call back later , i 'm really busy . ''
finally they figure it out and give us the roasted chile .
oh wait though .
it 's horrible .
i wo n't be going back .
i have been there _num_ times .
food ok but service ... ... horrible !
he got our salsa order wrong so needless to say , we left .
this makes me sad to write this .
did they bite off more than they can chew ?
completely unacceptable and disgusting to sell such expired food to your customers .
check the expiration dates on all purchase from here !
she over charged us for her very badly made drinks .
the food and drinks are very over priced for what it is .
omg what a nightmare .
the second time , though , was tonight , valentine 's day .
it was n't very crowded , so we were seated right away .
they were n't dressed how i would have expected them to be .
but , our waitress was helpful , and our food came out pretty quickly .
it was n't a memorable meal or experience .
the bleu cheese dressing , though , tasted pretty good .
i 'm not a fan of that .
the seafood is breaded and fried to the point of inedible .
the staff is rude .
the prices are too high for the quality .
just all around disappointing .
i wo n't be back .
went to this place for lunch last saturday , party of five .
and the waitress did n't return until after we were done eating .
horrible service and horrible food !
it took _num_ minutes for our waitress to even come to our table !
the crab cakes were so disgusting my husband and i had to switch meals .
i could n't even taste the crab !
the fish and chips looked great but it did n't taste like anything !
a complete waste of $ _num_ .
my husband and i went tonight for dinner .
bad mistake .
worst meal we 've ever had .
busy , slow and awful .
the air conditioning was non existent , which is a hangover nightmare .
i 'm not a beer drinking novice .
bland .
i should n't have to ask for napkins at the point of need .
no tip , never coming back .
service gets _num_ stars and food gets _num_ stars .
overall , this place gets a _num_ stars .
then again , we were in pittsburgh , so it 's a given .
the waitress was slow getting around to us .
i wo n't be back .
first , all of the food was extremely overpriced .
i could n't have tried to make food this poor .
extremely slow service !
i would give this restaurant _num_ stars if i could .
i do n't even know where to begin .
service was horrible .
the lunch took _num_ hours .
it was not .
it was a side salad with a handful of grilled veggies on top .
and a side salad at almost $ _num_ .
not worth it .
just awful .
what a complete disaster .
we were both craving seafood , and had never been here before .
needless to say , we were unable to take advantage of any specials .
anyway , we sip our disappointing drinks and decide to order an appetizer .
we did not feel any of these things .
it 's not like they were busy .
in short , i do not believe we will be dining here again .
this place was terrible .
the seafood tasted old .
the bathrooms were gross and probably never clean .
i am just hoping that i do n't get food poisoning later tonight .
why on earth did i go back to this restaurant ?
clearly , i must not love myself or something .
want to pay too much money for fish that smells like a sewer ?
there were _num_ of us on a beautiful sunday afternoon .
with _num_ waitresses .
the fish was hot and crispy .
but the clams casino were inedible .
the clams were served raw with a burnt bread crumb topping .
the crab cakes were also bad .
it took _num_ minutes to get someone to take the bill .
poor service .
took _num_ minutes before someone came to take our drink order .
took another _num_ minutes to get the drinks .
the waitress then proceeded to say the mussels were ready .
not worth wasting your time .
went on a wednesday night , not crowded at all .
service was just awful .
no he did n't !
the fish sandwich arrived nearly _num_ minutes before the rest of our meals .
i will give them hell . ''
service was terrible .
brick oven pizza cold ... .
asked to have it reheated , still came back cold .
steak was way over cooked .
was not busy but waitress was hard to find .
would not go back and would not recommend this place to anyone .
friends warned me not to eat here .
this was just awful , start to finish .
and a generally miserable experience .
and this was an early lunch with very few customers around .
are you kidding me ?
that 's not a lobster roll !
the `` lobster '' was sparse , tough , and flavorless .
at $ _num_ each this falls clearly into the ripoff category .
and trying to get our check ?
ridiculous .
i wo n't be back .
we did n't realize most of the restaurants are closed on mondays .
tried thin man , closed .
however , the last few times we have been there it has been terrible .
while the food remains okay , the service leaves something to be desired .
the waitress was rude and less than helpful .
our _num_ drink and lunch took over two hours to complete .
diner _num_ - ordered the lobster roll sandwich .
nothing special - have no idea why people would rave about this .
bland and awful .
diner _num_ - steamed clams .
diner _num_ - ordered the salad with the lobster roll , hold the bread .
why the need to put lobster in a dye ?
sent the mussels back .
rest rooms are dirty , and smell of urine .
you have been warned ... stay away !
if _num_ stars were possible i 'd give em .
just saying - check your food before the waiter walks off .
look on his face - totally rude and completely inept .
i was hard put to give _num_ % tip to be honest .
you will only get frustrated with the slow as hell service .
suggestions , hmm not entirely sure since nothing i ate here impressed me much .
_num_ were supposed to be in an order but they only delivered _num_ .
_num_ more minutes for drinks , and to order .
i 've tried and tried to give this place a chance .
the oysters were absolutely disgusting .
they were not fresh , or cleaned very well .
as always , the service was terrible .
never again will i spend money in this place .
service was great , however , the food was mediocre .
they had to be cooked prior to us ordering , or even getting there .
the burger was just eh .
overall , this joint was not that great .
waited for about _num_ minutes at the entrance .
no hostess coming up .
she did not apologize and says that it will take another _num_ minutes .
i just did n't feel satisfied at the end of my meal .
and it was cold - did n't even take my winter coat off .
so , needless to say , not the best experience .
overall , my experience was okay .
we got the scallop appetizer and it was to die for !
i will _num_ % go back for that !
that being said , it was downhill from there .
i 'll go back for the scallops , but would n't recommend anything else .
the beer choices and the casual menu was right up my alley .
unfortunately the food was not .
ca n't recommend the place .
waited 15-20 minutes for service and it is not busy .
waitress did apologize for cup but it was too late - chose to leave .
i noticed the beer sampler and thought i would give it a try .
they were cold but did not taste fresh .
the lobster inside was a small amount , cold and tough .
the slaw was reasonably good and cold .
i would be hard pressed to ever return .
stopped in on the fourth of july for evening cocktail and small meal .
from horrible service to terrible seafood ... would never return .
um , no ... it was more like garbage sewer sauce .
mussels were freezing cold .
how can a seafood place serve terrible seafood ?
this place is terrible .
spend your money somewhere else .
she brought our soups , which luckily had spoons in the huge bowls .
poor excuse for seafood !
unless you sit at the bar , the service is poor .
is n't even that great at the bar .
the place is gross !
i liked the bar .
overcooked and dry , dry , dry .
this lobster was dry and chewy .
lots of it , though i guess that accounts for the high price .
then the other day , we went back and i tried pizza .
the toppings were terrible ( pepperoni , sausage .
super disappointed in this place .
when the food arrived it was mediocre at best .
will not be coming back to this place unless i 'm dragged .
they may also want to schedule a couple more servers on a saturday night .
i think one star is being highly generous for this restaurant .
it was by far the worst experience at a restaurant i have had .
it was disgusting .
this was such an absolutely horribly disappointment of a restaurant .
do n't waste your time here , especially if you have kids .
oh and less than stellar fries , with a cup of cole slaw .
ugh if i could give this place _num_ stars i would .
what a nightmare .
after almost an hour of waiting , i still had no pizza .
you do not deserve this job and should be fired .
after reading reviews i was afraid of what kind of service we would encounter .
i would n't order food here , again .
this place is less than mediocre .
visited on a friday night and it was pretty crowded .
the clam chowder was just ok .
like , i was shocked by how much it tasted like nothing .
not worth the bucks .
life is too short for less than mediocre food .
absolutely a waste of time and money .
service is just terrible .
the food was terrible and way overpriced .
just awful .
the restaurant was too busy .
the bathrooms were atrocious .
it 's never horrible .
has n't made me sick , again .
i do n't eat seafood often so i would n't know .
service was okay not the greatest but not the worst either .
kitchen staff was slow in execution especially for not having a big crowd .
huge portion .
despite the size , the flavor was lacking as well as texture .
they used real garlic and it was served with it - minced .
looks better than it tastes .
there were _num_ of us and they brought out three .
my salad came out shortly after the appetizer sliders .
no soup for me apparently .
no bueno .
unless your are here for a beer , forget about it .
i tried one but could not taste the chicken but otherwise it tasted okay .
the person next to me ordered the beer battered giant fish sandwich .
no fish .
terrible experience here .
the mussels were barely seasoned and were hardly edible .
it was awful .
i got the lobster roll and was really disappointed .
did n't even offer a food menu .
paid for the lousy $ _num_ beer and got up .
there was only _num_ bartender working so the service was a little slow .
the food was bland at best .
alas , the bisque tasted like wheat paste .
on wet cardboard .
maybe i just ate the box ?
else , you will find better value and experience elsewhere .
i did n't think it could get any worse ... .
i witnessed more apologies to customers that day than i ever have .
it was n't even crowded .
it took _num_ minutes just to get our waters .
i had to spit the oyster out in a napkin .
the food , however , was disappointing .
it looked like it went bad and they cooked it anyway .
then i tasted it and knew it went bad and they cooked it anyway .
that , for me , ruined my whole meal .
no amount of butter and salt could save that corn .
my bf got the steak with battered shrimp .
waited to be seated for _num_ minutes , no one greeted us .
she walked up the stairs and ignored us .
needless to say , we will not be returning to this place .
never going back , letting our bank handle this one .
super slow , cold fries , freezer burned carrots , rubbery lobster claws .
wait , ceasar salad was ok !
no stars !
great shrimp cocktail but i wish i had my fish sandwich across the street .
my overall opinion is that the service was terrible and the food was overpriced .
anyone who had french fries said they were cold .
the mashed potatoes were lukewarm at best , and the vegetables were cold .
the only good thing about the experience was the beer selection .
for a $ _num_ meal each , not great .
i will remember to never return while i 'm in pittsburgh .
horrible atmosphere for the food on the menu in parts .
they charge like $ _num_ for this , which is a complete ripoff .
here on vacation and the waitress seemed annoyed we wanted food .
lobster roll was dry and salty .
if anyone had asked , i would have shared these comments .
lack of chicken and brown , mushy lettuce .
i see why this place is hurting for business .
terribly salty `` lobster roll '' on greasy bread .
needless to say we wo n't be back !
literally disgusting .
their food is gross and i 've seen nice running around in there .
no host and the bartender asked if we were going to eat .
ordered the lobster mac n cheese as an appetizer .
for dinner i ordered the pan seared scallops with red mashed potatoes .
extremely disappointed in this dish .
then , my brother got the prosciutto and arugula pizza .
it was nasty .
my chicken sandwhich was also made with rubber chicken .
horrible experience .
this is one of the worst experiences i have had at a restaurant .
they squeezed _num_ people into _num_ small tables given the restaurant was fairly empty .
the only way to describe the food is disgusting .
-i split the giant beer battered fish sandwich .
the fries were cold , and the sandwich and fries were very greasy .
between two of them they finished one piece and could n't tolerate anymore .
i tried a bite of it .
the waiter was terrible .
overall the food , service , and atmosphere deserve _num_ star .
i would not recommend them .
so why just a `` _num_ star '' rating ?
terrible service !
told _num_ minute wait for food .
sarcastic bartender and place half empty .
the steamed mussels arrived in a grey broth that looked like sewage water .
the crab cakes were cold and overly salty .
what a horrible experience .
thankfully , our later stops were much better .
my appetizer was cajun shrimp , which was way over seasoned .
i could n't even see the shrimp underneath the thick crust of cajun seasoning .
the mashed potatoes were great , everyone agreed on that .
the bathrooms were disgusting .
this is probably the worst review of a restaurant i 've ever written .
but this place was just awful .
terrible tuxedo rentals !
when i picked it up , it did not fit !
poor excuse for a gentleman 's store .
oh , and its very very expensive !
the staff at the downtown location tend to be rude .
dark roasted , bitter , etc .
rude .
he did n't make a comment but i thought , rude .
what i received was a whole milk latte .
she said `` fine '' ( rude ) .
but this is n't what i ordered .
and am not a fan of the _num_ % .
rude .
so very rude .
that was not a real latte .
it 's sometimes tough to get waited on even with nobody in the store .
she clearly has no clue , pride or care in coffee making .
unfortunately , mike & tony 's closes by 6pm .
cheap gyro combo = cheap tasting meal .
the fries were cooked to perfection , but lacked flavor .
the gyro itself was mediocre .
the slice of chocolate cake , while a descent size , was rather tasteless .
she apparently had no time to take a wet cloth the the tables .
i kind of felt bad for her .
the food can be somewhat disappointing but will sometimes do in a pinch .
they are open late hours , so sometimes that can be handy .
it sits in the warmer cases , and looks `` crusty '' .
owners should know how they are being represented at the front register .
it is cheap food , and you get what you pay for .
it was very cold inside the restaurant .
my husbands pork was a small portion .
it was very inexpensive and i understand why .
wo n't go back or recommend it .
my dad and i walked in around _num_ pm on a friday night .
the dining room was about half full .
people just seemed to be standing around this whole place for no reason .
sucks .
why post a closing time if it is n't honored ?
this is an odd little cvs .
this was my first time trying brown bag deli too .
this was one of the most disgusting restaurants ive ever been in .
so , i decided to sit outside as i had already ordered my food .
then , i go to check out , my dinner was $ _num_ .
i hated it !
followed with an arrogant face !
please ... .
!
the only restaurant that gave me so rude , unprofessional answer ever !
oh my god ... .
should i really tell him how much he deserved ?
this place was really busy when we arrived so it seemed promising .
overall the food was hit or miss .
the most disappointing were the pita and the gyro meat .
my companion had the salmon and said it was unremarkable .
all patrons walk through the kitchen to use the bathroom which was really gross .
even homemade wine and honey soaked cake wo n't bring me back again .
this place was really gross .
the olives were even disgusting -- how do you mess up olives ?
the bill was way too high .
if you really hate someone , you should take them to this restaurant .
dirty , unclean , my friend and i went to lunch here .
this place is below par in just about every way .
i asked for my check and barely ate anything .
do n't bother with this place !
i wo n't go back .
the hummus is a little bland .
my issue was the price , $ _num_ .
my boyfriend and i decided to split the platter , which was horrible .
Neutral
mostly negative , but hey i was hungry and gave it a shot .
i declined that after reading is was mediocre at best .
* the owner failed to mention the pita bread was extra .
it tasted worse than it looked ( if that was possible ) .
tough cheese mostly tasteless and chewy .
another mistake was sitting outside when they are trying to bring people in .
i ordered the chicken kabob .
very bland and it actually tasted baked not grilled .
i did n't finish it .
the spinach pie was ok .
bland again and very chewy .
it did n't taste fresh , almost frozen at one point and microwaved .
the cheese pie was pretty bad .
i will not go again .
better than nothing , i suppose .
none of our food was good .
a struggling business is always sad to see .
but with all of the strange behavior , attempts to scam us , etc .
too slow service .
was waiting for my check about _num_ minutes .
annoying waiter .
i 'm not sure if this is working hard or just desperate .
_num_ ) the owner is pushy .
_num_ ) the portions are small !
_num_ ) the lemonade is _num_ % ice !
_num_ ) $ _num_ tip even though the owner is the server .
stay away and never look back .
i had spaghetti and meatballs and a caesar salad .
normally i hate salads in places like this .
the lettuce tastes old and rubbery ... not in this case .
find something ... anything else ... it is going to disappoint .
service is lacking and food is mediocre .
no thanks .
disappointed .
however , neither were great .
in fact the room we sat in had approximately _num_ open tables .
just my _num_ cents .
do n't get me wrong ... the food is not atrocious .
but it certainly is sub-par .
the service was mediocre .
it has gone downhill badly .
the last visit last night was the third strike and sw is out !
very poor service and food .
the drinks were all ice and refills were not timely .
this is the strip district after all with many stores for crying out loud .
the food was very poor .
my wild mushroom and chicken was not warm but tasted okay .
we will not be going back .
why anyone would willing go here to eat is beyond me .
anyway , i ordered the wild mushroom pasta with chicken .
the sauce was really disgusting .
thank you for your feedback regarding your visit to spaghetti warehouse .
your comments have been sent to our general manager , christopher beers .
their service is a hot mess !
just getting our drinks out was confusing .
for our dinner , we were given a salad , entree , & tiramisu .
it did n't taste fresh at all .
there was a list of _num_ or so entrees we could choose from .
i unfortunately ordered the fettuccine alfredo -- worst ever .
i could make better alfredo using the sauce from a supermarket jar .
the tiramisu also was gross .
i 've never been to one & was really excited .
seriously though , their food is so bad .
it tasted like it came out of a walmart freezer on clearance .
wo n't be coming back anytime soon .
came here later in the evening on a weekday to an empty building .
the food left much the be desired .
the service was the worst i 've ever encountered .
needless to say we did not return to redeem it .
overall , i 've got no complaints about the food .
but there was no one there .
after waiting way too long to even be acknowledged , my order was taken .
skip to the second time .
while this is happening , several waitresses come to the bar to get drinks .
i was a little salty with her , i 'll admit .
this place is dead , but they just do n't know it yet .
a couple tables taken , but no sign of staff in the bar .
not a table in the bar area had been cleaned in that period .
and the restaurant is empty !
maybe _num_ % full !
they made us wait simply because they ca n't staff correctly .
no wonder it is _num_ % empty but still makes people wait .
as my review makes clear , i ca n't compare the food .
and i am certainly not a fan of the olive garden .
you ca n't screw up pasta -- it would be very hard .
our waiter ( vincent ) had _num_ tables .
i gave him my drink order and then he asked for our dinner order .
why would you not just get our drinks ?
not terrible .
true , this is n't capital grill , nor was i expecting 5-star service .
i did n't even know what fine dining was until college .
the worst service ever .
it was almost empty and twice we had to have someone find our waitress .
the food was mediocre at best .
total waste of money .
i went here after seeing a musical and it was terrible .
my sister sent hers back because it was cold .
the place is old and outdated , and the restrooms were horrible .
save your money and make spaghetti at home !
they are understaffed , incompetent , and slow .
it was like getting waited on by 1st job people .
it 's tacky too hot .
they play pop music and it 's supposed to be an italian place .
very very slow service and no authenticity in the meals .
im from california and was excited to experience this restaurant .
unfortunately what i got tasted like a canned sauce with minced onions .
as much as i hate olive garden ... i would preferred that .
ca n't give this place anything lower than _num_ star .
all our food was the thrown together in the same pan .
not worth the $ _num_ .
worst place ever .
we talked to the manager i 'm assuming which did n't really care .
said hopefully we come back because service is n't usually this bad .
we hopped this was a one off and not typical .
avoid this place at all costs !
nothing i had tasted good .
just skip it .
nothing special .
did n't seem handmade or anything like that .
service was incredibly slow .
i probably would n't go back .
the wedding soup was the worst i have ever had .
the meat balls had absolute no taste , kind of like cardboard .
the spaghetti tasted no different than boxed pasta .
our garlic bread came out literally black .
i ca n't even believe somebody would serve that .
we will not be back .
every dish had several things wrong with it .
even the bread was stale .
mushy spaghetti drenched in the worst sauce i ever had .
i wish it were possible to give this place _num_ stars .
they 're wrong .
the pasta is consistently overcooked .
the service is not only poor , but the staff are rude .
i will not visit this restaurant again .
i 'm not italian , but i cook way better than this myself .
there was a little bit of a wait which is expected on saturday night .
my son 's macaroni and cheese was salty and cold .
this place is a disaster .
the service is really spotty too .
pros : never a dull moment .
the whole experience can be both amusing and depressing at the same time .
baked ziti average .
dont like too soft pasta , al dente preferred .
i was not impressed at all .
he seemed to be in a bad mood and made us feel uncomfortable .
however , food wise , it was just ok and a bit disappointing .
i of course had filet , and i was just so underwhelmed with it .
the flavor was meh and the black truffle butter was surprisingly boring .
they are taken over by a very large mega restaurant chain corporation .
gone is the famous gm bill .
changed too seem to be the quality of the steaks .
the meat was n't special .
the deserts were ok but the creme brulee was bland in the extreme .
service was ok but occasionally inattentive .
my biggest gripe , though , would be the overcooked scallops .
wow , not so much .
very strange experience .
the food was bland .
nothing to write home about .
i dined at morton 's last night jan _num_ , _num_ .
the food was not good .
i feel i paid $ _num_ for a $ _num_ meal .
service was great but it sure was n't morton 's quality ?
what the hell is going on people ?
omg , the cheese cake ( at $ _num_ ) was very dry .
$ _num_ is not working for me .
his side of mac and cheese was laughable .
i 'd have to say i was pretty disappointed with my overall experience .
the sides left much to be desired .
i ordered steamed broccoli and he ordered mashed potatoes .
we had to send the potatoes back because they were cold .
do n't believe i will be returning here unless it 's free !
terrible value but the steaks were good .
$ _num_ caesar salad with tasteless dressing that probably came out of a bottle .
$ _num_ side dishes .
probably the worst value around .
we had dinner tonight and were so disappointed .
the food was bland at best .
the only thing that was efficient was the valet service .
the service is here so incredibly inconsistent .
the way you are treated is sub par .
the entire staff was rude .
the downtown office has ruined america 's best for me forever .
the customer service here is horrible .
i feel like everything i say is wrong .
very poor customer service at this location .
$ _num_ down the drain .
it was a horrible experience .
if only they could train their employees better .
there was mildew on the floors of my bathroom and bathtub .
the washer and dryer was old .
the sofa looked old and was not comfortable .
i did not use the comforter and one of the layers .
there is also a _num_ inch ?
they did not offer me a chance to pay for it .
i never used the sauna , so i can not comment on that .
this is rather expensive as well .
this is not a bad place to live .
the shop is n't that great anyway .
such a shame .
it was made of wood .
the women at the front of the line had been waiting ten minutes .
finally , someone wandered in from the back and rang up our items .
i guess all customers are n't equal .
the high prices and poor treatment do n't add up .
i put up with the rude employees and dirty store because of this .
here is where my mistake happened .
sad , very , very sad .
not worth your money .
needless to say , this completely ruined my meal .
it tasted like milk and no coffee .
i was exceptionally disappointed .
managed very poorly .
6am is too early for her .
out of _num_ reviews , i 've written only _num_ _num_ star reviews .
that 's _num_ % .
if you hate the public , you should n't work with them .
she never even looked at me .
rude .
not hearing me , she goes , `` what was that ? ''
was she having a bad day ?
i dont know , i do n't care .
managed very poorly .
6am is too early for her . ''
seriously lady , you 're not a morning person .
my latte was n't bad ... was n't anything special either .
would n't come here again .
will probably never go here again because the person servicing me was rude .
they simply did n't care .
worst brazilian wax i have ever gotten .
she also used the same stick the entire time which is not sanitary .
eyebrow waxing is significantly overpriced at $ _num_ .
do not go here for waxing !
sorry that i did n't feel like waiting for three other customers .
i will likely not give them my business again .
my order was $ _num_ .
i got nowhere until i asked that a count of the register receipts .
that was not acceptable to me .
there is a bitter taste in my mouth about lotus grocery .
this is not giant eagle !
never shop at this asian grocery since many more open .
owner and employee alike no manners and nasty .
good store - rude owners and employees .
not anymore though .
not because of the food but the attitude of those cashiers .
so gross !
staff definitely are really rude .
try not to come here unless it 's for emergency .
the food you need to be careful , because sometimes they are expired .
also , parking is a big problem .
finally on tuesday , i came out to the shop at _num_ am sharp .
i tried on the dress and it was super short .
it was about _num_ inches off the ground !
other than that , it needed hemmed and taken out just a touch .
long story short - she took the dress in ... significantly ... by mistake .
there were no apologies for the mistakes .
we sat down and jim pulled out a list of what they had discussed .
i arrived and was disappointed to not see the arrangement i ordered .
imagine my frustration .
unsatisfied customer !
for $ _num_ plus delivery ?
will take my business elsewhere in the future .
no big deal , i would have been happy to help out .
i stopped in during lunch and ordered a steak burrito with guacamole to go .
when i received my order i immediately opened it to take a bite .
my biggest issue was the utter lack of any taste .
that 's right , my burrito had no flavor .
it was all beans and guacamole .
food was only just ok and service was even worse .
i 'm so disappointed in my experience at the carnegie library !
_num_ $ later , i tossed it and walked out , miserable .
this place is not _num_ stars .
i 'm too annoyed right now to make any funny comments .
it 's ... just ... not that good .
it all snapped into place for me one day recently .
that pissed me right off .
second , the rolls here are sloppy .
the beef was not the right color and was basically bland .
i would n't call this place authentic korean bbq .
just do n't expect fantastic korean bbq .
nice big restaurant , just lacking in overall experience .
this place was mediocre at best .
not impressed .
gross !
sad thing is , i 've been here a couple times .
so on to the sushi , oh yeah , it 's gross too !
the thing is the fish does not taste fresh at all !
but i 'd suggest you not !
you can not pay me money to eat here again .
they can not even cook edamame , it was undercooked and cold .
texture and temperature of the fish scared me .
save yourself pain and throw your money out the window .
first of all , foods were n't impressive .
they are too pricy as well .
their foods are not that tasteful .
in addition , one server working there was really rude and had bad attitude .
i do n't understand why he is working there .
he was so rude and ruined our friday night .
it 's really frustrating .
i wo n't come back this unpleasant and pricy restaurant never again .
absolutely the worst sushi my husband and i have ever had .
it was gross !
you could n't pay me to go back to this place !
upon arrival , the place is nearly empty .
however , it was also past lukewarm to the point of being cool .
the most disappointing part is the sushi itself .
the food that was delivered to us was simply inedible .
it had a huge hair in it , all wound around the crab .
totally disgusting .
they actually screwed up a green salad .
horrible , horrible , horrible .
total waste .
we will be calling again today to get our money back .
sushi is not overpriced although the rolls could be made better .
there are much better sushi choices available .
i was there on a monday , so i just tried the sushi .
do n't bother with the sushi , ca n't speak to the korean bbq .
long story short : i ordered delivery .
vegetable roll was good , but not exceptional .
fried rice was ... just not what i expected , not exceptional either .
still , would not recommend .
pricey and does n't live up to it at all .
was the worst i have ever had .
will not go back .
i am sorry to say that this place still stinks .
that should have tipped me off .
i ordered the spicy chicken off of the lunch menu .
my food was terrible .
avoid this place at all costs !
fine , i had a sushi craving and could n't care less .
i ordered my spicy tuna and salmon rolls , both came within _num_ minutes .
but for the sushi - forget it .
that is simply lazy .
this place was awful .
her meal was so hot she could n't eat it .
mine was just disappointing .
the only thing i found good was the plain rice .
i also thought it was extremely over priced .
great service but the sashimi was bad .
never been here before .
disappointed in that .
what reason would a restaurant serve water in a plastic cup is beyond me .
Negative
i had a pretty negative experience for my first trip to sushi kim .
korean barbecue requires either the patron or the server to cook at the table .
i will give sushi kim another chance because i know others rave about it .
the wait staff -- not too pleasant !
man ... really bad from start to finish .
service is slow and horrible .
sushi is not flavorful at all .
the rice was some of the worst i have ever had .
i was definitely not wowed by the sushi here .
not bad but i have better in the strip .
so disappointed .
sadly , they just are n't .
could n't keep my eyes open !
another waste of time , wait until people my age get old .
i can guarantee you we will not be wasting our time in this theater .
avoid this crap hole at all costs .
the food is not that great .
my husband thought that the crab was bland and overcooked .
the menu is blah and the food is also .
awful service , overpriced food .
do n't waste your money !
on arrival , waitress seemed lost .
the wait staff is incompetent and the food is grossly overpriced with zero flavor .
i just paid the bill and we left and went to eat n park .
when we showed up , it was like i 'd never called .
the service here sucks .
it just sucks here .
it 's hard to beat the atmosphere of this place in the summer .
however , the service is seriously lacking .
the service has always been very slow .
go in summer or no point in going .
i 've went for _num_ years now waiting for it to become something good .
it 's not going to happen .
i ca n't begin to express my disappointment in your establishment .
the bartender gave my sandwich by mistake to another customer .
i waited .
)
ordered , is not .
the bill .
a little pricy for food but not too bad .
this is a poorly run business that could be turned into something great .
it was my anniversary tonight , a tuesday .
i was so excited to get all you can eat crab legs !
very disappointing .
however , the food and service is sub par .
not impressed .
_num_ minutes later half of our party needed to leave .
they went home hungry and very unhappy .
it 's not even summer yet .
i stopped by here this past thursday night with three others for dinner .
that was definitely not the case though .
mediocre at best .
buffalo shrimp $ _num_ you get _num_ , barely enough to share .
shrimp tacos were ok just on a basic bed of slaw for $ _num_ .
no drafts or specials on a friday when we got there at _num_ .
the river view from the deck was nice , but the smokers were not .
rode my bike out to meet my old man .
but seriously , there are still restaurants that allow smoking ?
_num_ stars .
my husband ordered the margarita pizza & i ordered the shrimp tacos with rice .
hubby did n't mind his , my was terrible ... horrendous .
rode my bike out to meet my old man .
but seriously , there are still restaurants that allow smoking ?
_num_ stars .
service was slow and inattentive all night .
described as having crab , lobster and shrimp .
seared ahi tuna sandwich - _num_ people in our group got this .
fish tacos - _num_ people in our party got these .
long story short , we wo n't be back .
overpriced beer and overpriced , bad food .
battered and fried .
we did n't care for the atmosphere and did n't actually eat anything .
in the running for one of the worst restaurants in pittsburgh .
looks great from the outside but everything else about it is terrible .
they turned no wait off and said they tried to call me .
the food sucked .
peel and eat shrimp were dry and tough , not fresh .
ordered crab cakes , they were dry and the crab tasted old as well .
will not be returning .
probably wo n't be back .
Neutral
i 'd give this store negative stars if there was an option .
no one at the counter even acknowledged my arrival .
it looked rather like a barber shop .
the staff did n't look very professional either .
and after her comments , i 'm so glad that i decided to leave .
very poor service and atmosphere .
thumbs down !
at that point i would 've just taken a plain biscuit !
a complete lack of work ethic , it 's disgusting .
you do n't have to have people in the kitchen who act like that .
rotten food and over charging customer .
the crab cake sandwich is well prepared but from rotten crab .
a lunch over charged and wasted .
did n't go so well .
they then brought out two manicotti dinners which were fine .
who serves a drink without ice ?
we had no silverware , had to request it repeatedly .
our entrees , dessert and coffee all came out at different times .
the prime rib was fatty and cold .
the atmosphere is also drab and just depressing .
avoid !
the food is pretty bad for an italian restaurant .
i ordered a side salad and it was all iceberg lettuce .
the homemade bread was very sorry ... .
not worth the price .
the decor is very plain .
the food was underwhelming and pricey .
it 's just not that good .
the food could have come from a buffet and been better .
this place is just a flat out joke .
had no clue what i was talking about .
food was overpriced and less than average .
she had zero personality .
you 're probably thinking $ _num_ or $ _num_ , right ?
wrong !
now i really wish we would have .
i would have been furious if i paid $ _num_ for tasteless pasta .
never again will i go there .
the only reason i gave it a _num_ is because the steak was good .
otherwise , it would have been a _num_ or _num_ .
i 'm a guy , i 've got a short haircut .
nothing fancy -- short on the sides and back , an inch on top .
the top was n't even and was kind of a mess .
i wo n't be back .
fairly average italian food other than the meatballs .
too many good italian places in pittsburgh to choose here .
interior could use an update .
beer selection below average and nothing special happening with speciality drinks .
the food quality does n't match the place at all .
i had the chicken flatbread and the chicken was more like subway chicken !
zero stars .
the only good thing this restaurant has going for it , is their bar !
worst .
they said that each vegetable would be $ _num_ each .
with that said , i opted out of the calzone .
i ordered a steak and cheese hoagie and it arrived in a burnt bun .
i may try the pizza but other reviews noted it was pricy .
no refills , no checks on the food , nothing .
they do n't make whole pies and slice them up for individual slice orders .
the salon is so dirty we left before i let them cut me hair .
save your money , this place does n't deserve to be named ruth chris .
if this is the case then my oh my how the mighty have fallen .
sadly , however , they did not .
that does not make me chop liver .
however , my father and i shared the porterhouse for two .
for $ _num_ , i would have expected a much better piece of meat .
there were some pieces which could not be cut by my knife .
in addition , the presentation was poor .
i could have done better at home .
i 'm really torn by this review .
unfortunately , the worst part of my meal were the steaks .
next time i 'll try morton 's or capital grille .
but one is supposed to come here for steak .
extremely disappointing and appalling .
we were seated and our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable .
the corn chowder was ok but not very hot .
the steaks came and were both overcooked .
again , the food was mediocre but the staff was extremely friendly .
this was the only place where nothing tasted like any of them .
fail on all levels .
had to send steak back twice before i just said to hell with it .
horrible .
plus they have the worst presentation ever !
they clearly used too much oil and did not let the meat rest .
never going back !
how far we have fallen .
our bill was over $ _num_ .
tip was $ _num_ .
what a disappointment .
this is the `` service '' industry and you missed the mark tonight .
poor , slow service .
steak was over cooked and the plate was hot but not `` sizzling '' .
i said no , not yet which was probably a mistake .
our wine was not delivered until after our steaks arrived .
we will never return to a ruth 's chris steakhouse .
he gave them a quick polish and took $ _num_ off the price .
he had my money and had no more use for me .
this place is horrible .
you can get better service elsewhere for cheaper .
i brought my boots here to get fixed .
i wo n't be going here again .
no accessible stalls in restrooms .
not handicapped accessible .
wrong .
after i ordered , the waiter came back twice .
once to tell me that they could n't do the veggies .
oh , with _num_ pitiful shrimp on top .
there was the powder parmesan on the table which i added myself .
oh , but wait until i got my bill !
the shrimp were $ _num_ a piece .
what a rip off and so much for my budget .
we had a big group but my bill did n't have the tip added .
get me out of here !
i get that -- but the place was empty .
the place is empty .
it was such a nightmare .
i did n't know hamburgers were traditional italian fare .
the prices here can be ridiculous .
i mean , empty .
no one else in the same dining room .
i took the olive oil off the table next to ours .
so , i 've tried this place _num_ times and that was enough .
not worth the attitude of the staff .
it was just meh .
the chicken was n't very well seasoned and the sauce was overpowered by lemon .
all i could taste was citrus .
i also had a few bites of the chicken marsala .
i was really disappointed with this visit .
we probably wo n't be back any time soon .
Negative
negatives : the lighting , the decor and the smoking .
glad we went , but we wo n't go back .
so i left .
the selection here is stellar , but the prices are ridiculously high .
even whole foods is less expensive .
the service is most often rude .
the gelato counter was disappointing .
is n't that the same as `` not made fresh in pittsburgh ? ''
the truffles had two salted , one of which was milk chocolate .
they were so salty that the chocolate flavor did not come through .
however that is not what pittsburgh is about .
this is just my experience .
no thanks , much better candy shops around the city .
rude !
any way i could n't figure out what their problem was .
thank you for your horrible customer service i will never be back.
there 's nothing about this specific location that is bad .
inside is just average quality , equally average priced produce .
cheap , everyone seems to say that .
but i was n't feeling it here .
did n't even get a `` thanks '' with my change .
so not worth the walk that we took to get here .
we were greeted very warmly by one of the ice cream technicians .
the parlor looked nothing like the pictures on this website .
the technician was telling us how it was closed and had just reopened .
the character of the place was great but could use a little tlc .
the menu was very small and hard to read and understand .
the ice cream technician could only take one order at a time .
i ordered mine , chocolate , and cried vanilla .
she did n't listen at all .
i figured palace like this would have made their own strawberry topping .
_num_ sundaes were $ _num_ .
literally they kept their heads down and refused to make eye contact .
too bad .
no breaking of the ice .
this place is terrible !
ugh .
skip it !
really disappointed !
she left her other co-worker to handle the entire crowd .
we had the same experience when we walked in .
however i agree with the previous reviews that the staff are killing it .
just kind of awkward , but no big deal .
a regular ice cream cone was $ _num_ .
tasty , but not real butter pecan .
i gave her a call and she did n't pick up .
at this point i really had to use the restroom .
i waited until _num_ and knocked normally so that it would be heard .
i 'd give it zero stars if i could .
worst customer service !
but these corporate suits refused .
so - they 've lost a customer - a platinum customer .
a little goodwill would have cost them nothing .
truly pathetic .
when i checked in , the front desk staff was missing .
when i checked out , the front desk staff was missing .
the pillows were appalling and there was no complimentary breakfast and no refrigerator .
what a disgrace to the marriott name .
ok , but they do not go out of their way to help !
finally they allowed me to put down cash .
literally worst service i 've ever received at a hotel .
do not stay here .
you will be disappointed .
the manager nowhere to be seen .
no upgrades .
not personal at all strictly business .
the better restaurant is the little cafe across the street owned by same owner .
to get a cab walk to the westin across the street .
no hello on entering .
not friendly .
not a _num_ star .
really a _num_ star .
nothing to recommend .
do n't walk away .
not even the shuttle goes anywhere useful .
linda b august _num_ will never stay again !
i had a bad impression of this hotel before i even entered .
eventually , i had to get my project manager to resolve this issue .
do no stay here if you plan to sleep before 2:30 am .
that young lady obliged with no hesitation - i was very grateful .
the desk ) until i 've given the room the all clear .
i could n't have been happier !
no bueno and no thank you !
my second room : same line , 3rd floor , also accessible .
that 's unacceptable .
shower shoes , i never leave home without them !
i reserved a king room and got stuck in a room with two queens .
i will not be staying at this location again .
they apologized which i appreciate , but it does n't fix anything .
i ca n't wait to check out .
her corned beef was brown and bad .
the real reason for the single star was the cole slaw .
it was off .
yuck i have avoided this subway like the plague .
i literally walk past this subway _num_ times a week .
the attitude of the workers here is just pitiful .
what a wreck .
rude customer service .
my gripe here is that i ended up with scratches on my wheels .
waiting _num_ minutes for a cold club and cup of soup is totally unacceptable .
it was not crowded , but the waiter was almost useless .
plus i was served teriyaki fajitas .
overall it was just ok food served by an incompetent waiter .
for me the food was terrible .
i would n't even have cooked this way for an enemy .
they are in terrible shape .
i could n't believe it !
well , this place manages to be worse than it .
the place is rather run down .
the buffet was really terrible .
it just was n't a great environment .
_num_ stars .
soups were borderline offensive .
there probably wo n't be a wait !
bad !
worst chinese food in pittsburgh !
this is the worst chinese food i 've had .
and pittsburgh has some pretty bad chinese places .
the golden palace buffet is bad , but at least edible .
it was late at night near closing , only thing i could find open .
went to _num_ tavern for lunch a few weeks back .
second i was with a party of _num_ that all ordered salads .
overcooked and cold .
the salad had way too much iceberg lettuce and tasted like crap .
the place was empty .
it 's the same thing but _num_ more dollars .
they did have other types of dogs but they were more expensive .
it was bad in every way it could be bad .
frozen , greasy , tasteless , heavy on bland batter and light on fish .
so why do they get _num_ stars instead of just _num_ ?
but each time i come away disappointed , even more than last time .
every time , the hotdogs ( and brats ) are harder than a rock .
wo n't be eating there again .
i do n't understand why this place think 's it has famous corned beef .
i can only believe it 's because there are no other deli 's downtown .
the corned beef is nothing great and their side dishes are nothing special .
not worth the trip .
i do n't think sammy has ever even had a good corned beef sandwich .
meat was dry under seasoned and luke warm .
the bread was just sliced supermarket bread .
rules made by men .
when the food finally came it was bad .
the prices are cheap , but it 's not worth it .
the food itself was not too bad .
not my favorite .
my friend 's greek salad however was very tasty .
a place i would go back to but not regularly .
the food was terrible !
we quickly found out why .
i would not recommend this place for food .
this is a very small irish pub .
the bar area felt cramped and made me uncomfortable .
are you gon na eat that ?
if not , um , why would we want to pay for it ?
terrible .
they did n't accommodate for a member of our group that had an allergy .
the soda was flat .
possible the worst restaurant i was ever in .
worst experience at a restaurant ever .
i do n't need anything fancy but this was pathetic .
why did n't we just leave then .
if i could rate this a zero , i would .
food was not awful , but just barely average .
worst restaurant ever .
finally got seated and waited _num_ minutes for waters and then ate mediocre food .
wo n't be back .
the steak was rough and bad .
i will never be back .
i have better food in m own .
definitely has the local irish bar feel to it .
mine was not very cold and his pour was light .
$ _num_ credit card minimum .
no bathrooms .
it really feels like a total lack of effort , honesty and professionalism .
this represents a real problem for the city .
this place was horrible .
the walls were dirty , nasty and dingy .
it smelled awful inside .
it was quite crowded .
and i just did not like my surroundings .
not a good way to sell the city ... horrible !
this continued for the total of _num_ hours .
there is no wifi and only two outlets .
it would have probably been better to take the mega bus .
not good at all .
thus station needs more amenities and a makeover to compete with the dc one !
the `` chicken '' is dark , fatty , and inedible .
do n't miss the _num_ pound tub of msg as you walk in .
you should skip this place for sure .
the place was more of a hole in the wall then i can appreciate .
cheap but your getting what you pay for in quality .
the food was gross and i usually would n't say that about a place .
never going back .
it 's not worth it .
they were very quick ( food ordered and delivered in under _num_ minutes ) .
the noodles were very bland and almost chewy .
my boyfriend 's general tso 's was less than subpar .
the egg roll 's did n't even have shrimp in them .
this is by far the worst chinese food i have ever had .
it was horrible .
the fried rice did n't have any vegetable in it and was so bland .
the egg roll wasnt even cooked and the cabbage was awful .
i called to complain and they hung up on me .
do n't waste your time , order from somewhere else .
worst chinese i 've had in pittsburgh .
i spend _num_ dollars on soggy food that lacked flavor .
cheap food but my chicken was burnt .
my co-worker 's chicken was n't cooked right .
not gon na order from here again .
we wasted $ _num_ on spoiled food .
do not use this dry cleaner .
there are ash trays and packs of cigarettes lying around .
they lost my clothes and charged me for stuff i never sent .
ehh ... it 's not all that .
watch the dried bulk stuff - it 's old and stale .
i found little bugs crawling around the seeds and nuts in my little bags .
bought the store 's speciality sausages - bland and tasted of spoiled meat .
cold cuts were good though pricey .
Neutral
_num_ .
highly questionable hygiene for a food store !
disgusting .
i will not go back until they clean up the place .
that was not the first time .
i have a idea , get rid of those cashiers , fire them !
i will not go back until they are gone .
a simple yes or no would have been nice .
in a very rude voice .
needless to say i walked away .
obviously she hates her job , then get another one !
every january i buy _num_ months worth of cheese for my family members .
i proceeded to say , '' are you laughing at me ? ''
altogether , spent $ _num_ and left with a great disappointment !
extremely poor service .
this is the last time i try this unclean and rude establishment .
Neutral
breeze and the cat was tested and was negative .
there was no internet at the time .
i would not bring a spider there .
if i could give this place _num_ starts i would .
it was just average , nothing special .
this is no mike and tony 's or big greek gyro in market square .
i wo n't be back .
the workers are not greek chefs and are very condescending .
the gyro sandwich for $ _num_ was ok at best .
they threw some tomatoes on it .
the fries for $ _num_ were undercooked .
we are talking a plain bottle with mystery ketchup .
they charge about $ _num_ for a drink with no free refills .
tables were not very clean .
disappointing experience after almost a year since the last time i was here .
ingredients were n't fresh and the gyro was heavy on the spices .
ordered a gyro and the meat was cold .
not acceptable .
i really do n't see the hype .
i 've only eaten here once before .
i 've included this very depressing looking `` steak hoagie '' .
the food was terrible & the cooks need to get it together .
just order from one of the two sites i listed above .
not one employee even said hello !
i walked out !
, the service was fine , but the food was totally forgettable .
i remember the waiters attitude more then some of the food .
the menu is n't particularly veg friendly , but it 's not too bad .
lidia 's does high-end traditional italian without being too pretentious or too predictable .
i really wanted to like this place , but i really did n't .
long story short , we passed on dessert .
i wo n't go back .
lidia 's is an upscale olive garden with slightly better wine list .
the biggest problem ?
everything is bland .
they have a salt problem .
the lamb chops were awful .
lamb tasted like the grill and not at all like lamb .
the tomato was hard as rock .
just bad .
bread is awful .
just in the way it is laid out and with the choices .
but the worse is the pasta trio .
the concept is just so olive garden .
i just have to wonder why lidia would create a menu like this .
it just does n't match her books or shows at all .
it does nothing to support the brand of lidia .
unless she is really trying to take over the olive garden market .
their menu does n't include really any .
maybe those light fixtures would have tasted better than the lasagna ?
the service was not very good .
we left overall feeling disappointed in the service and the quality of the food .
not so much .
i had a bite of a chocolate torte , and was very impressed .
all things told , though , i would spend my money elsewhere .
it was not spicy .
it was overcooked , like rubber , and served on plain white beans .
i wo n't go back .
most of his seafood was also overcooked and tasteless .
i was very disappointed with my meal here .
and was really disappointed .
too bad the food was n't good .
the beet salad was underwhelming .
my other dining companion had the osso bucco which was dry and stringy .
another disappointment .
and thus my rating of meh .
which is a huge shame .
this place had horrible service .
i was horrible .
we were eating here often , but it got boring quickly .
soooo disappointing !
i watch lidia on tv and have a lot of her recipes .
then , i ate here .
are these the same people running this restaurant ?
do n't you care about your reputation and good name ?
guess not .
also , the service was not that good .
too bad .
one word ; gross .
this is not italian food - it 's pittsburgh italian food .
the wine list is lacking .
in short , avoid this place !
the main courses themselves were a disaster .
and the manicotti was watery and flavorless .
i ordered the chicken marsala ( waitress 's favorite ) and it was disgusting .
lidia 's was a major disappointment for me .
decor and service were just fine , no issues there .
i was disappointed in the food !
i get better shrimp pasta at macaroni grill !
i 'm not sure why people like this place so much .
the service was friendly but the food was very poor .
i would not entertain having an event for any more than _num_ people .
what an embarrassment .
the lasagne i ordered was flavorless as well .
for salad , they only served `` caesar salad '' .
overall , let me say that the restaurant is becoming dated .
colors and decor seem boring and out of style .
the service was horrible .
from hostess crew to the bar to the waitress , it was bad .
rude .
did i mention the service was bad ?
the bar staff was n't concerned with us and were n't friendly at all .
then it took another _num_ to order .
then _num_ mins to get our food !
however , seconds never came .
waitress did n't even know until i told her politely .
however she charged the $ _num_ pasta trio ( which comes with desert ) .
now i had a $ _num_ salad and $ _num_ pasta trio .
i was expecting $ _num_ + $ _num_ salad upgrade .
ugh .
is n't the rule `` customer is always right '' ?
finally , we felt like the whole restaurant clientele has declined .
avoid !
what a disappointment .
we were so looking forward to the food but our experience was awful .
there was no background music .
the waiter was young and inexperienced .
would not recommend it .
this spot would n't have lasted a year in nyc .
i ate here when it opened , a and again _num_ years later .
nothing has changed .
for starters we were served ice cold meatballs and limp soggy salads .
the entrees were dull and lacked seasoning .
it 's tough to find anything good here .
the menu offerings were spotty .
gnocchi and duck ragu was what i ordered .
i was very disappointed .
ate at this resturant while on a business trip .
our food was just average , nothing special .
the service was absolutely horrible .
our waitress carrie was extremely rude and had a really bad attitude .
i would probably not come back .
lidia 's was one of our favorite italian restaurant in the city .
first , our waitress was not well informed of the offerings that evening .
she had to check with kitchen several times to answer our questions .
second , our food was served just barley warm .
third , the food was lacking in proper seasoning and without any taste .
i guess i expected fabulous -- but everything was just good , nothing spectacular .
we will not be back .
nothing to talk about .
the service was sub-par on a friday night .
for my entree , i tried the lasagna recommended by the waiter .
took my friends from out of town to lidia last night , very disappointed .
i could n't understand why people raving about it too much .
over charge and terrible food .
terrible will never go back .
calamari was not fresh .
pasta trio had the worst sauce i have ever tasted .
caesar salad was drowning in tart dressing .
pasta trio - _num_ out of the _num_ was passable .
good groupon deal but terrible food - will not be back .
horrible .
i do n't remember it being this bad .
pasta trio was bizarre .
only passable pasta was the pear & ricotta ravioli .
waitress walked away two times while opening our bottle of wine .
it was downhill from there .
lamb chops and shrimp pasta were just ok.
( $ _num_ + $ _num_ ) .
the salads came out and the plates were a little sloppy in appearance .
for the main course , i selected the gnocchi and grilled sausage .
the sausage was made in-house and was very flavorful .
very unappetizing and i was unable to continue eating .
the pasta was cooked al dente and the sauce was n't too sweet .
even the server commented on the lack of a sauce .
no meat in any of the _num_ pastas .
not very tasty .
not same price .
i had the pasta trio .
none of the pastas had any flavor .
the caesar salad was fine , but not inspiring .
the three pastas were very , very basic .
the only thing that saved the evening from disaster were our server and busser .
i think lidia & grandma would be appalled !
so i was appalled by a lousy not fresh dirty salad !
i pushed it away ugh !
do n't be fooled !
it came w duck ragu that was ice cold !
try their calamari over angel hair yum !
lidia should be embarrassed .
grilled octopus : where 's the octopus ?
waitress was nice but it 's obvious that this place is run poorly .
staff training is badly needed .
what a huge disappointment .
bottom line : horrid service , mediocre food .
no wine glasses or anything to make the table look pretty .
our server was nice but rushed .
there was absolutely no care or thought put into this salad .
my date 's bruschetta appetizer was bland .
i was presented with ... an empty plate .
which i really did n't since they were all mediocre with little flavor .
in the meantime , date was unimpressed with the chicken .
if possible , the service got worse after we talked to him .
and when the dessert came it was ice cold and solid as a rock .
horrible service and food was bland .
lidia should spend more time in her restaurants to see first hand .
the waiter said she only comes to town twice a year .
your brand is being damaged because your staff does n't seem to care .
very disappointed .
most likely will not return .
more disappointing than the service was the food , which was really underwhelming .
granted , the calamari and shrimp that were there were cooked perfectly .
risotto , while one of my favorites , is n't pasta .
it has been nothing but bad service .
i give a _num_ rating only because of the service .
there are fruit flies hovering around our table too .
the pasta with chicken was about the best from the trio .
it 's an ayce trio .
it 's now 8:30 and still not even close to dessert .
i 'm sure the ending does n't get much better .
we were ... disappointed .
our main dishes were equally mediocre .
the wild boar ravioli tasted fine , but the presentation was seriously lacking .
the duck breast was under done .
so disappointing ... .
he never approached our table , but he walked past us several times .
we continued to wait another _num_ minutes then decided to leave .
lidia should be ashamed that this is being run this way .
really wanted to like it here , but am never going back .
for a professional chef 's restaurant the `` pasta '' was mediocre .
fake italian at its finest .
unless olive garden is closed , do n't go here .
unfortunately yelp asked to provide more details on review .
the information for this restaurant needs to be updated !
last week my husband and i visited pittsburgh for a rock concert .
it was a very disappointing meal .
i ordered the pasta trio , and my husband ordered the risotto .
not exciting .
it was pasta , after all , one small serving of each .
i had dessert , which was _num_ flavors of gelato .
sorry to say , restaurant is riding on its former reputation .
the bartender does n't belong in the business .
rude to patron and to his own colleagues .
a turn off .
first off , it is desperately in need of some updates .
and service is piss poor and understaffed .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ big screen tvs .
well sports rock failed on all accounts .
i was encouraged when we walked in and saw individual tvs on each table .
plus , beer was _num_ !
prices too high for strip district beer .
upstairs looks like it 's a club at night .
it is a white pizza with minimal ingredients except for the lamb skewers .
standard so-so pittsburgh pizza .
if they did n't , that would be fine we 'd call someplace else .
should be _num_ minutes '' .
_num_ minutes later the delivery guy calls and says he 's on his way .
_num_ minutes later he calls again and asks where we are .
when we finally got the pizza , it was not hot .
better luck next time .
after ordering from here my credit card number was stolen .
ordered two personal size pizzas , spicy fries , fried zucchini & onion rings .
tastes plain & over cooked .
i do n't think i 'm being harsh .
is sad because the pizza is great but the service is horrible !
delivery : horrible experience .
we waited over _num_ hours for the food to be delivered .
she promptly explained that the internet was down .
and , apparently , delivery .
it was all kind of meh to me .
food is terrible so is customer service .
there are better restaurants in pittsburgh .
this is piss poor excuse for a turkish restaurant .
this was more than _num_ hours after i had placed the order .
as soon as i hung up the phone , the food was delivered .
i did not receive the free cheesy bread and the drink order was incorrect .
i would be careful ordering food here .
the service was very poor .
delivery was fine but the food was terrible .
disappointed !
unacceptable .
but it was seriously bad .
but i could n't eat it .
are you kidding me ?
these hoagies are the most pathetic hoagies i 've ever seen or eaten !
you should be embarrassed and ashamed to even be selling these !
horrible !
we checked in , put our stuff in our room , and left .
later on , we realized that there was no soap anywhere in the bathroom .
you 're paying like $ _num_ a night for no soap .
about _num_ minutes later someone came with soap .
it was a super rude way of dealing with that situation .
the next morning we tried to leave and it was nearly impossible .
the whole experience was absolutely ridiculous .
but would it kill you to spend a little to upgrade your rooms ?
upon entering it smelled of sewage and was very dark .
it did seem a little unwelcoming and a little dated .
i was then transferred to housekeeping where i was constantly sent to a voicemail .
it is unfortunate because that blanket has been in the family for _num_ years .
i was tired , packed bags , and waiting to get to the airport .
i did n't hear back .
they said yes , and i just confirmed it had not been .
by far , the worst hotel staff experience i have ever had .
i would never stay in this hotel again .
the cleanliness of the bathrooms is less than desirable .
the pittsburgh auto show was held at the david l. convention center .
we lucked out and go on the shuttle over without waiting in the cold .
it was terrible waiting in line , but it moved quickly .
it was $ _num_ a piece for my wife and i to get in .
children _num_ and under are free .
$ _num_ for _num_ items is crazy !
domestic beers were $ _num_ .
i mean thats absurd to charge these prices !
the auto show was a disappointment .
that was frustrating !
it was pretty busy and there were people everywhere .
it was annoying fighting the crowds to look at the certain cars .
all in all , it was a disappointment this year .
we might not go every year , but maybe every other year .
the check-in desk was super slow during my stay there .
still , i think there are newer hotels that provide the same .
we got this hotel room via hotwire at a great price .
parking at the hotel is expensive .
my biggest complaint is that our shower was n't clean .
the coffee shop attached to the hotel is just ok .
or it had just spilled and they did n't want to waste it .
however , the customer service lacks excellence and the wifi is completely unreliable .
completely worthless wifi .
we have stayed in westin hotels all over the country .
but this place is downright disgusting .
no fitted sheets on the beds ?
the tv movies did n't work ?
the place is just dirty .
two seconds later , they come to want to clean ?
i would n't step foot in that hot tub ever again .
unless you want to catch a disease .
so gross .
the pool is strictly a lap pool .
and the women 's locker room was nasty .
looked like it had n't been cleaned in a month .
the only plus was the shuttle service and driver .
do n't stay here , save your money .
however , i had the absolute worst hotel experience at the pittsburgh westin .
_num_ .
the terrible experience happened before i even arrived .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i ordered the turkey blt with lemon aioli and arugula salad .
_num_ .
_num_ .
really poor service and way overpriced .
the rooms are not worth the money .
the wi-fi was free and the tv channel selections were pretty good .
i would not revisit the westin convention center .
had to have my sheets changed when i got to my room .
worst elevator system i 've ever come across .
rude front desk staff .
talk about a nasty look and attitude .
i was sooooo disappointed with this hotel .
the ac barely works .
_num_ stars .
but maybe they 're not even trying !
again this is pittsburgh not philly , dc , or ny .
breakfast options in the immediate area are almost nonexistent .
the coffee maker is disgusting and smells .
i gave the management a heads up , and it was not fixed .
disappointing at every turn .
this hotel does not live up to the westin standards i 'm used too .
the hallways smell as do the rooms and they are not clean at all .
the beer is cheap .
horrible , go to long john silver 's .
i hear oyster bar and think delicious raw oysters not deep fried crap .
i should know better than to have high expectations .
the two jumbo fried shrimp were ok.
nothing but breading .
ugh .
both the waitress and the bartender were extremely rude .
i was n't impressed with my clam chowder .
however , they have several cooked selections .
i should have known then that it would be a bad experience .
waitress wiped off table and pushed crumbs into my lap .
styrofoam plates and plastic forks .
it really is just a bar with bad bar food .
cash only is really customer friendly as well .
do n't understand how anyone could give this place a favorable rating .
i 've had the fried oysters before , and they were pretty good .
this lunch kinda sucked .
a native all my life and never been , finally went last summer .
why it 's locked i do n't know .
totally gross !
sadly this one did n't do that for me .
this restaurant is horrible .
the waitress was rude and tried to rush us .
the only oyster on the menu is a terrible patty of some kind .
i found this restaurant online and in my hotel room magazine .
sadly we were disappointed with our meal .
we were in an area with a server , but the service was terrible .
i 've never seen it somewhere stating they only take cash .
are u kidding me ?
i am disappointed .
the food was ok but it 's not memorable .
imitation crab & lots of filling .
so i do n't need to tell you how nasty that was .
my house made chips were good & cole slaw had very little flavor .
so i was like dang !
my return is questionable .
first thing they said to us was , we only accept cash .
guess what , no fresh oysters .
the beer was cold and that is the only reason they got one star .
i was embarrassed because he was my guest and it was my idea .
if a cold beer is all you want , go for it .
this place is a pittsburgh legend u got ta stop in .
the oysters are also old , as in not fresh .
just checked it out for the first time .
kind of disappointed but it was five dollars for the shrimp basket i got .
the shrimp does n't have any flavor and just tastes like grease .
i was the girl who came in tonight , alone , around 8pm !
_num_ minutes later , nothing .
eventually i had enough and left , which they still probably did n't notice .
avoid at all costs !
i do not recommend this restaurant .
the fish sandwich is bland on a generic bun .
the soup was nothing to write home about .
the fries were generic .
long wait time for initial service and drink refills .
just not what i had in mind .
i wo n't be going back .
when the oysters came out , they did n't even look like oysters .
they were very flat ... thinner than your typical frozen chicken nugget .
not much oyster taste , just the taste of the breading .
this was some of the worst pizza i 've ever had .
this does n't generally happen to me .
i could n't eat anymore .
avoid .
this place is awful .
they screwed up my order and refused to fix it .
its really too bad , they are super close to my apartment .
i 'm upset and offended .
but the place was disgusting and the cashier was incredibly rude .
had the gyro and added feta .
bottle of coke had icy slush in it .
update - went back another time and the pizza was mediocre at best .
possibly the worst pizza i have ever eaten .
this would n't even qualify as pizza in north jersey .
zero stars .
female manager on duty asked for $ _num_ in exchange for a pizza .
if i could give zero stars i would .
the eastern european girl at the register is awful .
she should probably get fired .
the pizza at this place is o.k .
last night i decided to give it another try and got crappy mozzarella sticks .
the meat in the steak sandwich was like dog food .
it gets packed .
i 'd never had the food before .
so gross .
i usually get the steak salad which used to be good .
the last _num_ times getting it , i have had issues .
i gave the bartender $ _num_ and only received $ _num_ back .
i can not eat this .
sticky floors , bad smell , just general lack of housekeeping .
not sure why people like it so much .
if we had been drinking we would n't care .
maybe they had a bad day .
one other person tried it and would not eat it .
the fish n chips were not good .
the fries were soggy and soft , fish mediocre .
very disappointed .
will not go eat there again !
there 's a reason why this place has no reviews .
it 's never open ... not even at 6:30 pm on a thursday .
i guess i was supposed to know that it was closed .
needless to say , i probably wo n't be back .
this is a very odd restaurant .
i was here once and probably wo n't be back .
you can definitely get better vietnamese elsewhere in the city .
she could n't believe that i said that .
i feel like she treated me like a criminal .
the service as mentioned was poor .
this place does decent thai food , but is nothing special .
this was the single worst thai meal i have ever had in my life .
this proved to have been a massive error in judgement on all our parts .
the first thing i ordered was a bowl of lemongrass soup .
gross .
we will not be back .
was just rude .
the wonton soup was horrible .
when i walked in the place was empty .
first thing i noticed is the place was an absolute sauna .
she shrugged and did not seem interested .
i ordered the lemon grass soup with shrimp and the papaya salad .
i would not order this again .
water glass was refilled promptly the one time it was starting to look empty .
the pad thai was bland and generic , and tasted almost gummy .
and i would n't have minded if the food had been amazing .
but sadly , it was n't .
we were seated immediately because it was n't too crowded ( bad sign ) .
did they think they could get away with it and we would n't notice ?
but then i got my chicken lemongrass soup .
it was so tiny and there was hardly any chicken in it .
waiter was awful and food ( pad thai ) was not much better .
this is by far the worst thai restaurant i 've ever been to .
the servers are rude and slow , and the food is awful .
just had the panang tofu for lunch , and was crazy underwhelmed .
this trip was bad , even for the price .
there was no sorry , we 're working on it ... etc .
no explanation at all was given .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
terrible terrible customer service .
poor service , awful attitudes and sub-par food .
thai tea was no bueno .
i 'll probably not be back .
there was just one table of _num_ seated and eating when i arrived .
and , a table of _num_ leaving and all paying separately .
all that said , the huge table of _num_ had left .
but , no such luck .
the food came out quickly enough .
but it was quite underwhelming .
i settled with the thai fried rice with beef .
there was a ton of thai basil in the dish which was quite overwhelming .
i chose the hot and sour soup .
the soup was neither hot in temperature or spice but it certainly was sour .
however , last night 's dinner was just plain bad .
it was also virtually tasteless .
the food is bland , bland bland .
the inside of the resturant is cramped and poorly maintained .
i decided to play it safe and ordered the broccoli in garlic sauce .
do n't waste your time or money .
rude service , and pizza was subpar .
na ... wo n't be back !
random pizza toppings on lettuce ) this time around .
just awful .
it really is pure torture sometimes .
ugh .
but no biggie - we agree to split into different tables .
ridiculous , especially if they were expecting us to be there .
an extra large pizza was so small it barely fed my wife and i .
also the pizza was bad .
way overpriced and service was n't great .
i only gave them _num_ stars because the pizza itself was pretty good .
i ca n't imagine anyone liking this super bland cardboard !
i just do n't get how anyone could like it ?
no taste at all .
both had no flavor and the crust was chewy and lousy .
no sauce much and cheap cheese .
somewhat generic , but the espresso gets the job done .
it was quite small though .
average pittsburgh pizza and fried stuff pile , nothing special though .
fried items arrive a little on the cold and soggy side .
you know , standard italian hoagie .
i substituted steamed rice for the fried rice .
it was like an old sweet an sour sauce with a little spice .
i could barely pick the shrimp out because the sauce was that gross .
hope i have better luck next time !
i just ate half of a cockroach .
gross .
the food was unremarkable .
every time i have been to cafe sam i have been very disappointed .
avoid this place .
got ta say , i 'm not a fan of this place .
confusing , and a pain .
but over the years it has gone down hill .
i wo n't go back .
my girlfriend had a similarly bland meal .
down the street is a better option - wish they were open for lunch .
under no circumstances would i eat here again .
but oh , how the standards have fallen !
looking back , i am glad it happened that way .
items seem overcooked or undercooked .
this was probably the worst plain cake donut i 've ever had .
it was dry , not at all crispy , and had no flavor .
i could n't even finish it .
i did n't find it to be anything special .
i am positive this bakery used to be better ... something has changed there .
it should have been a clue when they were soggy .
after my most recent experience , however , i will never be coming back .
she refused , and again tried to place the blame on me .
and sure enough , cue tuesday -- no call .
she failed to follow-up when she promised .
did i mention the cake was dry ?
i ordered a long john which looked pretty good .
unfortunately it was n't .
i ate maybe a bite or two before offering it to a coworker .
so many great bakeries in pittsburgh so i would not go back .
she showed me two options and i chose one .
it was also very dry .
they said they had an appointment to taste wedding cakes .
it all comes down to the crust -- i threw it out .
i had small cheese steak sub - asking only for mayo and lettuce .
but no .
mixed in with this were some dried herbs - maybe an italian mix ?
all i could taste was the overwhelming chemical , fake garlic flavor .
i mean thin like salad dressing , runny , thin .
this stuff tasted like really cheap , bad , ranch dressing .
while we are talking about the meat - why use this garbage ?
i am paying almost _num_ bucks for this sub .
well , this too was a massive disappointment .
yes , bland .
bad sauce with flavorless cheese .
yes , more for the garbage .
we ended up throwing out about _num_ % of what we paid for .
they just lost a loyal customer ... never again .
ordered _num_ cuts to eat in and _num_ and a hoagie to go ... .
they get _num_ star because less was not an option .
so i ordered _num_ for myself and my gf .
i get there and the total is over $ _num_ !
two and a half dollars more is not a little .
wrong again !
swimming i tell you swimming in grease !
and that its all the owners fault about the price .
poor food poor excuses and apparently poor ownership .
the crust was not like usual and to much sauce .
i used to love this place , but the service is horrible now .
if you want something delivered you have to wait about _num_ hours .
our food is always wrong .
will not be coming back .
bad service !
it was all i could do not to make a scene .
fuck that i do n't need to be disrespected like that .
they use some oil which smell different that killed the taste of my pizza .
also , the toppings were not greatly blended , just rather sprinkled .
did n't even enjoy the pizza crust .
avoid at all costs .
reviews but they let me down .
the barber could not even cut a straight fade .
i ordered here after the many good reviews but was quite disappointed .
the pizza was n't terrible but it certainly was n't good in my opinion .
zero flavor and the mushrooms were canned .
i am disappointed .
so it was no discount at all .
i can not review the food .
i did not get a chance to eat there .
all the white people get to eat , we do not ?
the woman who answered the phone said yes to both so i rushed over .
assuming this was due to the discount , i did n't complain .
receive my check to find out it was all full price .
she admitted it was she who answered yet refused to accommodate her mistake .
i do n't normally feel compelled to complain but that is ridiculous .
a subpar meal and subpar service in addition to false marketing .
completely ridiculous .
terrible .
this was flat , one note .
yep , this place is terrible .
_num_ star average ?
update : _num_ hours later and still feel sick from this meal .
ugh .
mediocre at best .
the flavor in the tiki masala was so bland .
worst delivery service .
they both looked old and one of them smelled old .
both of these dishes were extremely unappealing as well .
i sadly had to throw most of it away .
i did n't even know you could go wrong with chicken marsala !
i can easily say this is the worst indian food i have ever eaten .
maybe i went on a bad day but the food was pretty darn terrible .
but the noodles are a disgrace .
no way , dudes .
go down the street and get some tastier food at tram 's kitchen .
i 'm not joking about the water .
pho broth takes like nine hours to make .
in fact i was quite disappointed .
based on all the other reviews , probably safe to stick to pho .
if you have an emergency , go to the vca castle shannon animal hospital .
for everything else , try the cat clinic .
i asked about late hours but the latest appointment is at _num_ pm .
i start work at _num_ am .
i do n't need to receive attitude from a receptionist .
clearly , they do n't need my business .
i felt like i spent $ _num_ for absolutely nothing .
i think i 'll be going elsewhere next time .
it was a mess .
an expensive mess .
i stop in every week for it .
last week , i got a large and went back for more .
but , lately it 's been hit or miss .
it is all watered down and gross .
if your not a chain smoker , opt for takeout .
the bar reeks of smoke and the bar table feels sticky .
the only good thing is that the drinks are cheap .
but i really would n't recommend going there .
he obviously did n't care at all .
i called restaurant.com for a refund , and told them what he said .
i did n't get a chance to try any food and i never will .
this place is terrible .
tandoori chicken does n't taste like one etc .
decor is tasteless and old .
carpet looks really dirty .
i 'm definitely not coming back .
seem nice but the food is not that good .
no flavor .
we also had a masala and that too was not great .
this was not nearly as good .
very disappointing .
went there with friends for the first time and felt quite disappointed .
food was dry and the sauces were watery .
i do n't know why all the hype on this place .
trust me , you 'll be glad you did .
sadly , i was disappointed .
the karaoke host was just lame .
and he had a cd setup -- seriously , cds , in _num_ .
it was just really lackluster in my opinion .
the karaoke had a very limited selection .
wo n't be going back .
i do n't understand why people love this place .
the bar food is typical .
if you want no frills beer and bar food , they are no frills .
the place smells awful and the workers are grumpy .
no thanks .
there are other italian grocery stores close by .
i rushed to tan today after work .
atmosphere was bad .
i 'm weird like that .
it 's just generic stuff .
like i said , olive garden , only local .
so i would n't go back .
it 's not my kind of food , or place .
the other day someone asked me ... where 's your favourite vietnamese food ?
i do n't even care about the decor or seating etc .
it looked a mess .
honestly , it looked like someone had already starting eating this .
but as i ate , i was even more disappointed .
they hardly put any fresh vegetables in it , and the vermicelli is overcooked .
the spring rolls were completely soggy .
i do n't think their menu is limited though , it seemed fairly typical .
my boyfriend ordered the pork rice vermicelli bowl .
however , my dish was nothing to brag about .
it did n't taste bad by any means , but not restaurant quality .
my boyfriend 's dinner was a real disappointment , however .
it almost looked like boiled ground beef .
i do n't understand this either .
the rolls were extremely bland and chewy .
the sauce that was served with it did n't do much to save it .
the beef pho was sub par .
also : $ _num_ for pho does not make for hole-in-the-wall pricing .
for starters , the portion of the pho is extremely skimpy !
seriously , would it kill you to add more rice noodles ?
let me tell you , this place is a big let down .
i do n't know why people are giving it such rave reviews .
the portions are tiny , and the pho broth leaves you unsatisfied .
it lacks the true flavor that pho broth should have .
i quickly devoured the tiny appetizer in _num_ bites .
it took forever for the food to arrive , it was a big bowl .
so highly disappointed with my pho experience .
the restaurant setting is very typical of a vietnamese restaurant .
the menu is small with very limited choices .
then we had _num_ different kind of pho for our main entree .
there was also excessive msg in the soup dishes .
the food is cheap .
this is something that tram 's has gotten badly wrong every time i visited .
personally , i do n't see what is so special about it .
they 're big , but again nothing special .
at tram 's , the pho bowl is small .
the taste is reminiscent of pho but is n't quite right .
this was n't it .
it was dark and crowded ( and a little bit dingy ) .
bad service , bland food .
do n't believe the hype .
i think i chose wrong .
ordered the pho and it was mediocre and forgettable .
another sour note , they dropped off some spring rolls at our table .
later on , we saw them on our bill .
they were overpriced , and not worth it .
tram 's kitchen in my opinion is not really worth it .
the food was mediocre and full of msg .
the pho was nothing special and place was small and looks dirty .
my total bill does n't reflect the price of the dishes i ordered .
my bill came out to be higher than what 's listed on the menu .
the service was okay , they were really nice and never rude .
the portions were really small .
i gave this place two tries and was disappointed both times .
either way , i do n't understand the hype surrounding this place .
the color of the dish was as bland as the taste .
as for the atmosphere , not a big deal for me .
if that 's not enough to stop you , read on .
bland and disappointing , the pho most of all .
the dish was dry and lacked flavor .
as it were , i was n't impressed .
on top of that , my meatballs were quite dry , even in soup .
the service , was not the best .
very disappointed !
pho is ok , not bad .
this is the worst .
i will never try it again .
maybe i 'm spoiled with good vietnamese food but this was terrible .
also questionable tofu in the vegetarian spring rolls .
i 'm vietnamese , worse viet food ever !
maybe i just did n't order the right dish .
i ordered the beef vermicelli bowl , one egg roll , one spring roll .
my husband and i stayed in pittsburgh for weeks and wanted to have pho .
i read about good stuff here but was very disappointed .
we have had vietnamese food in other states before but here is the worst .
soup has no flavour and it seems to have excessive msg .
egg roll and fried rice is too greasy .
service is not friendly .
turns out this was n't the case .
wrong .
the entire restaurant could use a thorough cleaning .
i left , and do n't intend to return .
try tom 's diner or eat 'n park instead .
heck , go to a grocery store instead .
the food is n't something to rave about but it 's edible .
never a dull moment .
finding a good ol ' diner in pittsburgh is n't exactly easy .
the restaurant has the diner feel , no doubt .
you ca n't mess it up ) .
the food ranges from mediocre to bland .
worst food in pittsburgh .
i think the food is boring .
wrong !
_num_ but i rounded down .
i do n't want to be too mean .
had no desire to eat throughout the day .
this was some of the worst food i 've ever had .
the two times i 've been there i was unhappy .
cheap , average diner food .
ummm , we 're pretty sure my boyfriend got food poisoning here .
it 's disgusting .
the food is crap .
they screwed up a club sandwich & fries .
kind of gross if you ask me .
food can be pretty good , service can be pretty bad .
so , i came to the diner having already eaten a light breakfast .
the toast was good , but i was too full to keep eating .
based on this one experience , i would come only for the pancakes .
service was really bad even though the place was half empty .
located in not such a great part of town .
food is just ok , grease upon grease .
waitresses do not make much of an effort .
we ordered wings and pierogies for appetizers , for which we waited _num_ minutes .
the wings were dry .
he did nothing to compensate us for the long wait .
this place is one of only a couple open in the burgh _num_ hours .
that 's an automatic star in this dead city .
the only items that are good there are the bacon and toast .
the food just is n't that great .
yeah , that place is that old and that outdated .
no parking = no visit from me .
- it 's _num_ and they have no website or menu .
it would take less than _num_ day of their time .
- they want $ _num_ for cheese on their eggs .
their chicken is better too .
a few of us went out after late night bowling to get some food .
it 's clear that cleanliness is not a priority here .
and the bathroom looks and smells like something out of the movie saw .
i do n't have time for this , i 'm very busy '' .
no need to be nasty .
typical diner look and menu .
i really do n't get the hype as the food was average at best .
!
puts it into a glass and serves it to someone else .
do not make the mistake and eat here .
overall , my experience eating here has been inconsistent .
when it was brought back , there was a small hair in it .
soup not hot , waitress and cook fighting loudly .
cash only is not an acceptable policy in _num_ .
this trend has to stop , it is not ok .
i refuse to patronize any business that only accepts cash .
this is a scam and highly unacceptable .
i dropped off my standard prescription today , with the head pharmacist .
he could n't have told me that prior ?
i could taste absolutely nothing from her veal .
the salad was basic iceberg lettuce and a few other veggies .
then the bill came to over $ _num_ .
it was truly , truly just plain sad .
do n't waste your time !
after they microwaved it it was barely fit to eat .
some had flavorless chicken piccata , fish and eggplant parmigiana .
the only thing with an aroma in this place was the tomato sauce .
waited _num_ minutes for two glasses of wine .
it was very awkward considering it was a first date .
the drinks took forever , i had something floating in my wine .
the soup tasted spoiled , the tomatoes in my salad were frozen and mushy .
this place is trashy .
total dive bar with awful food and service .
neither of us touched our dinner , we were afraid to eat it .
diners beware , spend your money elsewhere .
not much for atmosphere .
the service , in my opinion , is often quite rude .
the `` ambiance '' is loud , dark , dingy and depressing .
sorry , but i just do n't get it .
this place is hyped as the be all end all of burgers .
the reason why i rate this place low is the atmosphere is abysmal .
i 've had better burgers almost everywhere .
i dropped them off while i parked the car .
she said they would n't seat them because i was n't there .
the burger was pretty good but , i 've had much better .
what i really did n't like about this place was the service .
we had to flag down our waitress just to get refills .
we were rushed through our meals like we were n't wanted !
nothing special here .
not sure what all the hype is about .
but the burger was n't memorable at all .
we proceed to wait another _num_ minutes until a _num_ top opened up .
never understood all the hype about this place .
the burgers are rather bland and burnt .
and the wait was always ridiculous to boot .
in practice , it 's not very pleasant to go there .
every interaction seems designed to make people feel awkward .
the burger just falls apart in your hands ( or onto your lap ) .
i was disappointed .
i had a bacon cheeseburger and it was okay .
i did like the home fries , very yummy !
in all honesty i would 've rather had five guys or in-n-out burgers .
it 's not .
not even close .
i 've eaten there many times in the hopes that maybe i missed something .
oh but it 's not .
it 's not me .
it 's just not that good .
burgers are adequate - nothing special .
order something other than a burger and you do n't get much better .
this was my first and last time at this restaurant .
but i did n't send it back because i never send anything back .
i just ate it and it was a sloppy , greasy mess .
the bread was cheap and tasteless .
the home fries were just diced potatoes .
also , not one of us got ours cooked as ordered .
i just do n't understand the appeal .
i would consider a _num_ star rating if it were n't for them .
the decor is old school and seems satisfied in it 's current state .
however , it was absolutely nothing special .
also , the home fries were just mediocre .
i do n't understand all the rave reviews for this place .
as for me , i do n't think i 'll be back .
there did n't seem to be any seasoning of the meat whatsoever .
bland would be an understatement .
i had the kelly burger and it was just extremely massive and greasy .
the burger was so-so with little flavor , which was very disappointing .
the waitress made it seem as though it was my fault for bringing him .
the potato salad was awesome everything else was super sub par .
this is supposed to be the best burgers in the 'burgh .
if that were the case , i 'd stick to making my own .
baby on board , we walked in and waited to be greeted .
the inside looked a bit old and run down .
i would not suggest bringing a baby here .
the potatoes were very bland despite being served with warm butter on the side .
bad for an adult who is looking for something tasty .
this was not the case .
my burger was as dry as a burnt piece of chicken .
overall , tessaro 's fell flat and left me hung out to dry .
went once , only due to bad weather , and would never go again .
mediocre food and mediocre service .
_num_ of us came here for dinner and ordered burgers and drinks .
bad customer service and to be honest we had bad service all around .
they also have a wind problem every time the front door is open .
clearly , customer service nor quality of food are valued .
the dust does n't end there .
_num_ of us plus drinks was $ _num_ .
worst service and seating ever !
food is ok but the service is a thumb down .
i would never come back .
for me , eating at tessaro 's is like eating a costco hotdog .
maybe i should cut down on the costco dogs ?
staff was friendly and drinks were reasonable but nothing to rave about .
however , i wo n't be back .
terrible service .
was really excited to try this out .
did n't wait long to be seated .
but waited over _num_ minutes for them to take our order .
waitresses were overwhelmed and avoided us .
lack concern makes me wonder if we will be back .
the wait for someone to take our drink order was rather long .
i 'm used to ordering medium and getting medium well at least .
i do n't see why people really like this place .
they were soggy , and not crispy at all .
there are better places in pittsburgh to get a burger and fries .
it seems as if this place is now more hit or miss .
the food went from amazing to mediocre without missing a beat .
even worse , no seasoning whatsoever .
probably not .
so , i am fed up with bad service from this state farm office .
no effing way .
just my experience , but come on people , really ?
i went to this restaurant saturday for the first time .
we walked in and there were already some people waiting for a table .
i was excited about dining at this place before _num_ minutes of frustration .
stuffed mushrooms , but my seafood pasta just came up bland and too oily .
the broccoli in it was overcooked and the shrimp were undercooked .
Positive
if i could give negative stars i certainly would for this place .
i walked in sat down , greeted by friendly staff and great decor .
we sat outside and the service was very slow .
tonight , however , was just awful .
it was way too thick and absolutely tasteless .
it tasted like that yellow spray they use on grills .
the waitress did n't take the coke off of the bill until i asked .
it was very crowded due to little italy days in bloomfield .
we should have requested another waitress at that moment .
would never consider going back .
there were nine people in the bar section .
yelp need to have a zero rating for places like this .
just awful .
my boyfriend and i went to dinner here last saturday .
our food took forever and when it got there i was highly disappointed .
my alfredo was tasteless .
the veal was soggy and chewy and the sauce was sub par .
took nearly two hours for everyone in our party to get our food .
this was really disappointing .
i went out with three others on a friday night to grab some dinner .
unfortunately , we were all pretty underwhelmed with most of the dinner .
crispy on the outside , creamy and cheesy on the inside .
the entrees , however , left much to be desired .
everything tasted like nothing .
everything was just bland and disappointing .
pasta was watery and very limp .
presentation was so so and the taste of the food was mediocre .
i will not be returning .
these guys are definitely lazy !
pesto gnocchi okay , tiramisu okay ( except for the canned whipped cream ) .
_num_ star for food , gross !
_num_ stars for plate glass window people watching !
i had the linguine carbonara and it was more like scrambled eggs and noodles .
bland noodles .
i really would n't go back again .
( this becomes important later . )
they were significantly cheaper .
we waited fifteen or so minutes , the shots were consumed , etc .
( i believe it was $ _num_ total . )
i felt terrible for her in that situation .
nobody else even ordered drinks while we were there .
but this was not what i had in mind .
but the bed was a big disappointment .
the mattress was borderline uncomfortable .
i would not stay here , it 's not worth the money they charge .
my room came with an awesome jacuzzi .
looking into this place , they have no website .
there is no excuse .
i should n't have to look for something , it should obviously be there .
i read online that it opened at 11am , wrong .
it opens at _num_ .
not a good first impression .
not good .
thankfully they give it to me without further lip .
total for one waffle cone with sprinkles = $ _num_ .
the ice cream was nothing special .
not here .
but there 's nothing special about this place .
make sure your opening and closing time is listed correctly .
rating - _num_ out of _num_ .
it was generous for the `` _num_ scoop '' order .
in the future i 'll stick with scoops for my neighborhood ice cream fix .
coming here was usually pretty exciting .
( here as in the city , not silky 's . )
this place is just not our usual dive bar .
i was not even acknowledged .
this was a moderately steady thursday night .
i was n't standing behind the people 's sitting at the bar .
by `` multiple times '' i mean _num_ or _num_ times .
they would n't look at me .
this is about _num_ minutes after i arrived .
`` ill tell the waitress . ''
me : `` please may i just have my beer ? ''
it 's extremely frustrating .
my experience here was terrible .
a _num_ minute wait for a draft beer on a slow night ?
no thanks .
just there last evening after a _num_ hour shift at work .
the server apologized and offered to get the correct sandwhich for me to go .
not impressed .
the juice from the tacos also made the tater tots extremely soggy .
everyone else in my group was disappointed in some way with our visit .
mediocre food and also over-priced .
this silky 's pub place is a complete joke .
out of five orders , only two were done correctly .
he talked loudly across the whole restaurant to staff members back in the kitchen .
what could have been a very positive experience was absolutely ruined by this man .
so , yeah , the smell .
you play russian roulette with your quarters every time .
lol is the most expensive laundromat i 've ever been to !
so why is laundry on liberty so expensive and so busted ?
now i 'm sad , real sad .
the front staff is very curt and short .
edit : in my original review i stated this procedure was $ _num_ .
for my car the average oil change runs about $ _num_ .
on most visits it takes em about _num_ minutes .
no problems with my oil change .
honesty today must have been forgotten .
and that they were going to charge me $ _num_ for it .
they cracked my oil pan and it cost me four hundred dollars to repair .
avoid at all cost .
they will ruin your car .
terrible experience .
overpriced , terrible customer service , and long wait times .
i went to jiffy lube for a routine oil change .
very bad service .
they are extremely slow .
when i told them that , they just lied and said they did .
this place sucks .
they are incredibly slow and ridiculously over priced .
the gentleman told me it would be about _num_ minutes .
very long wait .
very very slow service .
the workers do n't seem to care about how long it takes to wait .
jiffy lube sucked .
took over an hour , cost $ _num_ , broke my air filter .
um , hello ... how about an apology for wasting my time ?
no thanks .
there was absolutely no salt of them when they came out .
the turkey burger was seasoned well , but it was dry as a bone .
lot _num_ is ultimately a forgettable lunch destination .
too busy with your iphone ?
my merlot was decent but the calamari was not .
plus i think i found a fry or two with the vegetables .
also lot _num_ had some funky smells throughout the time that we were there .
service could have been better .
i might return for drinks but only drinks .
the food is bad !
boring .
this appetizer reminded me of my mother 's irish cooking : tasteless .
a simple addition of caramelized onions would have solved this problem .
entree _num_ : beer battered fish and mac and cheese .
entree _num_ : fish tacos .
ok , so they were n't bad , but the fish was dry .
the attempt at adding flavor came with the chipotle mayo and sour cream .
the chef , however , needs a bit of training .
i am hoping that my experience here was an off night .
there was only one waitress on for the whole restaurant , upstairs and down .
another twenty six minutes pass and husbands food comes .
both the waitress and the bartender were downright hostile .
not my scene .
the food is mediocre ( at best ) .
the place is a total dump .
we ate breakfast food at 2:30 am after the bars closed .
a breakfast sandwich had weird burnt meat on it .
it just is n't for me .
this place has the worst french fries i have ever tasted .
all i tasted was burnt oil .
i could not even eat one !
also the sandwich did not stick together like a melted sandwich should .
ugh .
_num_ out of _num_ is not great .
i am so disappointed .
disgusting .
do not eat here .
i spent $ _num_ for only one edible thing worth $ _num_ .
so pissed !
the sign says it , the looks of this place are not the best .
i 've had much worse .
disappointing .
pasta was not homemade and sauces mediocre at best .
wine selection is very weak .
eggplant parm was a little better than average .
i 'm sorry , this place is simply not good .
unfortunately , it is yet another example of poorly made americanized italian food .
yes bread , this is not your best .
contrary to popular believe , this is not traditional italian !
this is what some would refer to as , terrible and heavy .
words could not describe my disappointment .
i 'll admit it , i 'm already an italian food snob .
is this what italian food in pittsburgh has come too ?
not real italian .
imitation crab meat at an italian restaurant does n't fly .
do n't worry but i wo n't come close to this restaurant again .
i was n't really a fan .
i 've made much better at home .
which was dry , overcooked and lukewarm .
did we catch them on a bad day ?
today , half the lettuce i had on my caesar salad was rotten .
i have no idea why it ever left the kitchen .
thanks but probably wo n't be back .
both meals were served barely warm .
the decor was old _num_ 's which could have charm but this did n't .
both plates were mediocre at best .
this was my first time here and i will never go back .
to start off when we walked in the place reeked of piss .
oh and that 's not the end of it .
i paid _num_ $ all together and it should have been free .
alexander 's offers some of the worst italian food i 've ever had .
unfortunately , the entrees were no better .
my girlfriend ordered chicken alfredo .
my mom ordered the mushroom ravioli , which was completely bland .
needless to say , my cannoli was awful .
do n't expect fresh food .
i was extremely disappointed w/ my experience at alexander 's last evening .
i had visited this restaurant in the past and remember it being much better ?
first of all , house chianti tasted like vinegar .
however , we were not offered any and forgot about it until this morning .
i am _num_ and i was probably youngest patron .
if you are looking for culinary experience avoid it .
it was a small side salad of iceberg lettuce and croutons with italian dressing .
what i received reminded me of mrs grass soup .
really bad italian food .
probably the worst i 've ever had .
the worst american version of italian food .
if you 're famous , why is there never anyone in your restaurant ?
the sandwich itself was , well , mediocre at best .
prices were okay , but no great bargain .
i have n't been back .
Negative
i rarely write negative reviews .
what a disappointment .
the salad was nothing special .
the spring rolls were nothing special and heavy on something off flavored .
the server got my order wrong .
i think it was overpriced for a pittsburgh restaurant as well .
this place was horrible .
i was very excited to try this place .
the pad thai was dry and tasteless .
i agree _num_ % on maggie g 's review .
ill pass i 've had better thai for less .
no more trying out different thai places in the city .
the food at thai cuisine is more pitiful than my sense of direction .
the carrots and broccoli was cooked beyond recognition .
okay thai food , nothing special , and overpriced .
ordered the eggplant with shrimp , veggie fried rice , and chicken satay .
eggplant was okay but lacked adequate quantities of shrimp .
however , would n't say this is very authentic thai food .
this was gross and a waste of _num_ dollars .
thai gourmet a few blocks down is awesome ... too bad they were closed .
the spring rolls were good and the dipping sauce was ok , nothing special .
i did n't think it was that good .
worst thai restaurant in pittsburgh .
i was greatly disappointed by this restaurant .
the place was very busy and noisy .
further , there did n't seem to be any seasoning on the steak .
it was tough and boring .
unfortunately , my head is sometimes up my own behind .
the place was much less noisy and crowded at my second visit .
the wings were awful .
they were large , tough and tasteless .
the sauce they were drowning in seemed to have almost a chemical taste .
the pasta dish would have been very good had it been seasoned enough .
the shrimp were perfectly cooked , though , and i was thankful for that .
nevertheless , i will not go there , again .
do n't waste your money !
my favorite sauce was the honey jalapeno .
they also did away with the _num_ cent wing night .
i just had the worst meal ever here .
very strange place .
not a big deal just thought it odd .
just meh sorta flavorless .
good place _num_ a large group to drink get apps tho .
went to getaway last night for famous fajitas .
decided to give them another chance and was disappointed .
5:30 on a saturday and only two other tables were occupied .
at noon on a friday i called getaway to place an order for wings .
i told my friend to forget about it .
( oh , heck no ! )
my wife ended up going to the bathroom for paper towels .
what an awful experience .
my steak hoagie was actually two mini sandwiches .
i would n't recommend it .
sorry chef jeff .
absolutely horrible service .
no thanks .
in a word : forgettable .
the last take-out pie we got was less than pleasing to the eye .
it 's not 5-star , it 's pizza .
i suspect it would be really delicious cold , for breakfast .
it was late and on the way home with nothing at home to eat .
stopped by fiori 's , have n't been there in years .
the pizza was just sweet without much other taste , almost like ketchup !
this place is popular , but it is just is not for me !
i really do n't understand the hype of this place .
the pizza was just ok .
it was decently greasy and the crust was n't all that special .
sure , it 's friday a busy night so an hour seemed reasonable .
it took another _num_ minutes before he actually got the pizza .
_num_ hour and _num_ mins is ridiculously long to wait !
they should have cut off orders if they were that overwhelmed !
the sauce tasted like sugar and the crust was bland .
after that , everything else is what i consider the personal taste part .
the sauce was to sweet and the cheese was not right to me .
i wo n't be going back , just because my personal taste .
that was really unprofessional .
the bottom and the top rated with grease .
it was disgusting .
the red sauce tasted like it was ketchup with sugar added .
loaded with cheese that had pools of grease swimming on it .
it was still dripping with grease .
i removed the cheese and just ate the crust with the vegetables .
i assure you this place is n't it .
garbage !
after all the garbage food you get unbelievable attitude .
the pie it self was a real mess .
the dough is some of the worst dough i have had yet in pittsburgh .
it is very dense and flavorless with no crunch at all .
its a dry dough too , very dry .
the sauce is very forgettable and watery .
and just leave this one alone .
i am giving it a _num_ out of _num_ .
really do n't get the high praise for their pizza .
their sauce is so thin and tasteless .
the cheese is almost too much .
i was quickly greeted by paul - who was great !
they continued to stare for several minutes , unbelievably unprofessional .
sadly i will never purchase a vehicle here again because of this experience .
which you failed , because of your tire .
you could leave a message , but they 'll never get back to you .
do n't waste your time and money here .
then shortly after , i needed to replace the alternator or the like .
this was a friday , and he said he 'd call back on monday .
monday , tuesday and wednesday came and went .
_num_ .
first , their clothing is arranged by color , not by size .
the upscale prices did not match the dingy and dirty store .
we wo n't be back to this one .
was n't worth it for me .
parking sucks .
just really lots of junk .
it is a cash only establishment and the staff was very rude .
i 'd rather spend my money at goodwill !
this used to be one of my favorite thrift stores .
it is now grossly over priced .
and it seems like everybody that goes in there are trashy and rude .
it tends to bring in the worst of people .
get the diagnosis and get several estimates to compare .
it seems like all these hvac guys are out to take advantage .
do not use , awful experience !
my house is under 1,000 sf .
he was there for approximately _num_ minutes .
i feel ripped off .
very sad to find that donuts are made the day before .
same goes for the provolone wheel .
the bread was not fresh either .
i 'm genuinely disappointed with the recent changes .
we stuck it out and left with no intention to return .
the icing was not damaged though as they were so stale they were hard .
so i contacted this bakery for a wedding cake approximately _num_ months in advance .
i do n't regret it at all .
what a nightmare !
the cupcakes were average at best .
sadly , yelp failed me this time around .
( _num_ ) i called multiple times but could n't reach anyone .
( _num_ ) left messages and no one called me back .
( _num_ ) they do n't have ready access to email .
if you send them an email , they do n't check it .
brutal .
they just do n't run a very professional operation .
terrible !
only had a bite of that and threw it away .
owner is a terrible terrible person .
tossed me out for no good reason .
it was like pizza soup in a crust bowl .
they do not cook directly on the brick though , they use pizza screens .
they are wasting so much money on cheese its sad .
fake words aside , this pizza really sucks guys .
this was our first time trying this place since moving to castle shannon .
the pizza was really really greasy .
we also got an order of _num_ hot wings .
they were also extremely greasy and had zero flavor of any kind of sauce .
their texture was rubbery and they had a `` reheated '' taste to them .
they were pretty terrible .
we wo n't be ordering from here again .
completely unprofessional and ridiculous .
none of this is exaggeration .
almost every order i 've placed had something forgotten or incorrect .
literally the worst experience ever .
only _num_ stars .
yelp as well as the online website said they close at _num_ .
worst mcdonalds !
someone needs fired !
seriously the worst mcdonalds i 've ever been to .
service is always slow .
but the situation inside is fairly ridiculous .
every mcdonalds has employees that hate their job , but never show it .
i hate this location .
every time , we have a worse experience with customer service .
my cashier never handed me a cup for my drink .
over time i 've been ignored , greeted with `` what do you want ?
worst service ever !
heck no !
worst experience ever !
will defiantly not go there again !
this leaves the meat dry and tasteless .
hostess was great , service was adequate .
the food is terrible .
if i could give zero stars i would .
ugh .
terrible food .
disgusting food .
third terrible .
the entrees are horrible .
the apps were good but do n't eat dinner you 'll regret it .
never going back .
this used to be one of our favorite restaurants .
the new pitas tasted like a doughy pancake .
my wife 's dinner was bland .
it was that bad .
my hope is that they fix their problems .
avoid at all costs .
i would n't go back .
well , this place is beyond horrible .
Negative
if i could give negative stars i would .
the service , however , was terrible .
no wonder the service was horrible !
will never stop here again .
horrible , rude service .
_num_ minute wait for fast food ?
made me feel uncomfortable , he was kinda nasty and condescending .
however , every times i drive thru pittsburgh , i always stopped here .
furthermore , i have ordered the shrimp with garlic sauce .
shrimp was hard to chew .
there was no aroma from garlic or onion .
i suspect this is probably made by the guy who station the fryer .
i purchase those passing pittsburgh , not really possible asking for refund .
it was so bad , i would not dear to try again .
i could n't eat it .
this is n't the first time that i have had this problem here .
takeout is gross .
i wo n't be back .
no changing tables in the bathroom .
no chop sticks or soy sauce unless you ask for it .
interior is dark and dated .
dry rice , no flavor , greasy .
wonton soup and a mediocre fortune earns this one ( _num_ ) golden star .
it was my last time , i will ever stop again .
stopped in with my daughter we just wanted something small to eat .
i left and very disappointed .
i have been a customer of sesame inn for many , many years .
two stars because they seem to not be able to get it together .
people were sat after us and have already received food .
either case , i 'm not thrilled .
not that the food was bad it just was n't good !
never ever get the all-you-can-eat .
they give you nigiri sushi instead of sashimi .
also , service was unfriendly .
my son and i stopped by china gate after a movie in the galleria .
there was no way this order was prepared and cooked that fast .
i refused .
there is such a thing as food too fast .
tonight was the worst experience we have had for a very long time .
and another which was not the one my husband had ordered .
the restaurant is understaffed , poorly managed , and the staff is badly trained .
too bad .
one star for the unpleasant experience i have had at this store .
it 's a shame he could not assist me with some grace and respect .
i will not be returning here for any musical needs .
i was a bridesmaid very recently and the bride got her dress here .
the dress comes in _num_ months later and is the wrong color .
i would never recommend this boutique to a bride unless you want added stress .
there are plenty of other bridal salons that would be much nicer and accommodating .
incredibly unfriendly staff , completely clueless consultant .
if i asked the price , she did n't know and did n't look .
think twice people before going here .
update : i received a very much appreciated phone call from the owner today .
she stated that she would go ask to see if something could be done .
they of course could care less about me .
what horrible service this place gives !
i wish i could give this no stars and a thumbs down !
the bride chose a dress hoping it would look better in a smaller size .
they know my measurements , they should know what size i should get !
the cost of the alterations were $ _num_ !
to date that has not happened .
the selection was not unique , though there were plenty of dresses .
it seems ridiculous , actually .
in addition , the knowledge of the associate was lackluster .
the oven was way too hot for this type of pizza .
it was also an outrageous $ _num_ dollars .
it was also fairly small , but that was almost to be expected .
we also shared a pasta dish which was incredibly overpriced .
we also had a serious problem with the timing of the food .
hmm a bit misleading .
but my date returned and relaxed with a glass of wine as we chatted .
the blond hostess refused .
as for the food and drink , it was just fine .
i wo n't be coming here again .
essentially three pieces of toast with various toppings .
certainly , this was not worth the $ _num_ price .
our server was attentive , almost to a fault .
way overpriced for just ok food .
on a tuesday night , there was a long wait .
the food was prompt , and the salad was more than enough to share .
the pizza was simply ok .
also , do not use multiple credit cards .
our pizza was burnt .
it tasted like charcoal .
but told our server we could not eat the burnt pizza .
it was cold and not a good portion .
i got a huge hot pepper that burnt the crap out of my lip .
just not a good value for the $ .
there were n't even many toppings to make it soggy .
probably give it another shot but not my first choice considering the prices .
i ordered the margarita , sauce , cheese and basil .
it was a wet tasteless mess .
i may return if craving a good caesar .
we will not be going back .
friday night is apparently not the night to go .
you can wait for _num_ minutes at the wine bar . ''
we repeatedly got dirty looks from the staff throughout our meal though .
by 6:30 , there were still a number of empty tables .
then there 's the main restaurant that i really was n't that impressed with .
the food i ordered was penne alla vodka , which was pretty tasty .
but for $ _num_ , and that 's all you get ?
and never refilled our empty water glasses .
lo and behold at _num_ minutes it comes out .
bland and soggy as we 've ever tasted .
very rude .
worst service in years .
unimpressive food .
the pasta i got was good , but nothing to write home about .
the only thing i will give them credit for their italian wedding soup .
overall , not impressed .
i probably wo n't return .
this used to be one of my absolute favorite places to eat .
i really like the pizza and marinated vegetables .
sadly i can not support a business that provides such poor service .
no salad .
no meat .
no dice .
better deals and better food at a mall food court .
$ _num_ for wedding soup ?
$ _num_ for gnocchi ?
no more .
what was worse was the pizza was just average .
it 's so cold - like sit with your coat on cold .
so disappointed .
we dined rather early , so there was no wait .
overall , a disappointing dining experience .
however , there were three hostesses at the bar chatting and seemingly doing nothing .
the restaurant was by no means crowded ( this was a sunday ) .
it does n't make sense .
the wine : _num_ inches served in a huge glass .
with all of the fabulous choices in the south hills , pick another destination .
this restaurant is going downhill .
first thing i knew was iffy was the meat and cheese plate .
they replaced the normal wooden board , and replaced it with a plate .
a white , boring , incredibly small plate .
food remains ok but prices have more than doubled .
i do n't return on principle .
their market square location worse .
waitress has n't checked on us in half an hour .
would rate the food , but have no clue because we are still waiting .
ridiculous .
waiter was not thrilled to be at work on a wednesday at 5pm .
my pizza was okay , nothing yummy .
way too over priced .
go for drinks and nothing more .
i 've been wanting to try this place for awhile .
disappointed but not giving up , we ordered one of each and proceeded .
the bread was thick and doughy ( clearly a filler ) .
i eat out almost every night of the week .
it doesnt taste like an actual japanese cuisine , it is very chinese .
and i can smell chinese food right after a few second entering the restaurant .
i expected bland sushi .
but hey , it 's pittsburgh .
let 's face it , this is not japanese food .
the food is ok but it is really more or less chinese food .
man , was i wrong .
the sushi was not fresh .
the sushi was n't rolled tight either .
otherwise , i really would n't recommend this place to other people .
there are no descriptions for any of the rolls .
they do not offer low sodium soy sauce .
the wait for _num_ rolls and _num_ pieces of sashimi took over _num_ minutes .
actually , everything i ate was mushy .
the side soup is luke warm , soup should always be hot .
waited about another _num_ minutes after we finished our food to receive our check .
however , they deserve one star because they do have one amazing thing there .
their ginger dressing is unbelievable .
miso soup had an odd taste this visit .
our waitress was mia most of the night .
i did not have a good experience here tonight .
it was fried tofu in soy sauce with red pickled chinese chilli .
so disappointed .
we ordered the filet mignon with chicken hibachi .
false advertising at its best -- should n't that be illegal ?
a group was sat without the reservation ahead of us .
we have been ordering food from little tokyo for almost _num_ years now .
over the last _num_ months i have to report they have lost their edge .
this is not japanese food , period .
horrible .
i swear it was worse than my first experience .
the locals that like this joint must have smoker destroyed taste buds .
the dough has that typical bad salty cracker pittsburgh type taste to it .
the flavor of the dough is generic and salty .
the dough was also fairly dense .
the cheese ruined this pie .
all in all this pizza just sucks .
some good some bad .
even burger king does n't microwave their breakfast !
the chili soup was n't hot .
neither of us had cash on us , ( umm ... sorry ? )
the screens were tiny and the women 's restroom smelled of stale piss .
odds are , you 'd get a better experience at home .
such a shame .
filthy , bad seats , more expensive than others .
we wo n't return here .
she said she did n't care and her manager did n't care .
i did n't care .
i sat in the little snack area and drank it .
overpriced snacks , and the sound on the movie was awful .
why does this place always smell bad ?
this is not only a bad business practice but it is illegal and fraud .
food is n't that great .
lots of tv 's though .
just do n't expect to get anything else out of it .
the ambiance is a little strange .
the service was also overwhelmed and really slow .
the service was terrible .
sorry , not sorry .
this place does n't do it for me at all .
do n't bother eating here .
a complete waste of money , avoid at all costs .
avoid at all cost .
_num_ there service is awful , _num_ there prices are awful .
sad to see it go .
but i 'm sure the mall 's rent killed them .
sad to see it go .
at the time , it was the premier cigar shop in the pittsburgh area .
the store is extremely pricey and nothing really interested us .
last week i went in with a busted window screen frame .
now it wo n't fit .
she slowly responded `` yeah '' hardly looking up .
i stood there for a second and realized she was blatantly blowing me off .
i guess because the big box stores are cheaper and maybe more accessible .
i am so frustrated with this service .
i should have just gone to giant eagle .
very disappointed .
this was a horrible experience .
i am extremely disappointed and will never order or recommend them for anything !
the galleria ... it 's definitely catered to the upper class .
i really do n't have much desire to go here !
management will not care about your complaint and certainly will not apologize .
and , no , i 'm not making this up .
to which my response would have been , `` oh i 'm so sorry .
none of them responded to me .
Negative
the management team of this mall would get negative stars if that was possible .
after getting my `` window '' they never showed up .
no call , nothing .
i sat around for an entire saturday waiting and no one ever called me .
it was horrible .
they also promised me a partial refund for my massive inconvenience .
i should have refused delivery and just got my money back .
i asked them three times to please try and they refused all three times .
if you are going to shop here , do not use their delivery service .
wo n't be going back .
wo n't be going back .
worst experience with a hairdresser ever , at this location .
yeah , that 's why i booked one at your salon .
horrible salon ... dirty , also , just as a side note .
online , their women 's haircut price is quoted at $ 30+ .
no , she went ahead anyway .
so go there instead is the best advice i can give .
for many , many years i had the same massage therapist .
massage but still had a _num_ hr .
wait which i left to run some errands .
it is very disappointing after having wonderful experiences here for over _num_ decades !
the worst salon experience of my life .
i gave her the benefit of the doubt & i completely regret it .
the first visit took almost seven hours , not _num_ .
it looked horrible .
she left about 1-2 inches of my naturally black roots !
i felt horrible .
she 's either incompetent or she ruined my hair on purpose .
she damaged my hair so badly i ended up having _num_ inches cut off .
i would give them zero stars if that was an option .
this place sucks .
they still have not apologized when they lost her insurance card .
i paid $ _num_ for shipping .
weird experience .
i have no clue what they gave me .
they just wanted to work , i guess .
i chose a sugar cookie and mexican cookie .
i 'm not wasting my calories on a bad cookie .
the mexican cookie was just the same consistency .
sorry buds !
the lady who works their , is super rude and never smiles .
the customer almost feels like they are bothering the workers .
it 's always dirty .
do n't think the floor has ever been washed .
it 's like they hate their lives .
wish there was a choice of no stars .
there was no noise control so sleep was impossible .
absurd .
horrible experience .
quite possibly the worst experience i have ever had dealing with a clothing store .
why would i spend hundreds of dollars on more suits ?
overpriced merchandise that does not last .
even the shoes fell apart after a few months .
purchased two suits and other items for my son , spending over $ _num_ .
i could understand if they were worn a lot , but they were not .
my recommendation would be to not buy suits , shirts or shoes here .
the salespeople are not pushy .
the team went out of their way to get us in quickly and efficiently .
the closet doors would keep falling off onto my little children .
we called about the issue and they sent someone over right away .
my overall point is just be careful working with them .
and not giving real receipts ( they use hand written ones ! )
i rest my case : avoid ten toes on walnut ladies !
losing customers because you make them pay for wifi access priceless .
the coffee is okay , nothing special .
this place just keeps getting worse and worse .
started with the bathrooms ... rarely cleaned , rarely working .
so long story short , this place is packed .
it 's a little annoying .
i 'm not a coffee snob i can do with it or without it .
but it seemed like i was absolutely bothering the staff this morning .
i 'm not a shady side hipster but an average person in workout gear .
felt like i was in someone else 's hood .
get over yourselves people .
if you 've got stuff to do , do n't bother coming here .
they apparently do n't care about your time or money .
servers here can be really rude .
it was n't even that she said it .
i wo n't be back .
the wifi signal is weak .
the drinks are not so great .
the frozen carmel coffee drink was much better than fruit smoothie .
it was gross .
slightly better than starbucks , but that 's not saying much .
it 's sad to me that someone would open a coffee shop like this .
so i decide to try a coffee tree for once .
i walk in , look around , look at the menu ... hmmm .
sorry , just not interested .
it must not have been bad because i do n't remember anything about it .
minus _num_ stars for not being much better than starbucks .
unfortunately , the wi-fi here is miserable .
its connection is also very spotty .
for a coffee shop , the food and drinks here are mediocre at best .
)
that 's about where the positives stop .
wifi is spotty .
espresso is pretty bad .
i must be missing something because this place seemed expensive for dry cleaning .
this place is out of my dry cleaning budget !
its owner , gary , enjoys parking in handicapped parking spaces .
this time , the staff were new , loud and mean .
as chance would have it , the owner gary was around .
the damage was done .
they just keep finding excuses and trying not to be responsible for it .
so disappointed !
i interacted with staff to get help with a machine that was n't working .
do n't expect any help when things get ruined .
i usually do both dry cleaning and wash and fold here .
i will never do any business with this jerk off ever again .
i have never been treated so rudely in my entire life .
i told him that i would rather donate the items to a theater .
will never return to the store .
i went here to fix a bad hair cut at the last minute .
i was livid and called to complain .
they offered me nothing .
terrible customer service will never book with them again .
my experience did not live up to my expectations at all .
i could have gotten a better wax at a cheap nail salon .
my eyebrow still has n't grown back to its normal shape .
not worth your money !
i wo n't be going back to see him again .
this place is awful .
i mean , so so bad .
she rushed me into picking colors for my nails and toes .
water temp on the chair got too cold too fast .
absolutely horrible customer service .
not sure what star rating to give .
it 's happened everytime i go and it 's really unprofessional .
as for beverages , they really skimp .
despite the spa pricing this is not the spa treatment .
price was as i expected for a nice looking salon .
the bed was dirty too .
gross .
she was clearly in a hurry .
well what a mistake i made .
they booked me with a guy by the name of jason .
it cost me _num_ to get extensions so my hair looked thicker .
i can not recommend this salon .
( $ _num_ for a hair cut i was n't satisfied with ) .
ok , so i really wanted to like this place .
that 's about as far as it goes though .
the haircut was $ _num_ .
they did n't wash my hair and the haircut took about _num_ minutes .
then , i went to go hang out with my best friend immediately after .
they charge me for their mistake .
but that 's apparently the way they do it .
the head massage was painful and rough .
i probably wo n't be returning for a hair appointment .
but i am not rushing back .
so disappointed with this place .
so disappointed with this place .
poor customer service and they were rude .
i was disappointed .
i am not a fan of this place .
please do not give them business .
you are better off going to another nearby dry cleaner .
first , they messed up one of our pants badly .
when i say they messed up one of our pants , they destroyed it .
rather , they were extremely rude and defensive .
for your own sake and peace of mind , do not give them business .
do not use this cleaner .
quality is poor .
refused to replace them or compensate me for the loss .
they do not stand by their mistakes .
have been waiting for _num_ business shirts and suits for over _num_ weeks .
customer service is poor .
this place is extremely overrated .
the salmon was ok but not worth the $ _num_ either .
i 've been here a few times and have always been disappointed .
last night the service was especially lackluster .
the first time i went it was okay , but was very forgettable .
unfortunately , the food was mixed .
i had the chicken ramen soup for a main course .
it just was n't very good .
this includes the broth and the chicken .
as it is , i wish i 'd gone somewhere else .
dear pittsburgh , we are foodies from boston .
it 's unacceptable .
a restaurant like just should be nowhere near your top _num_ .
i would prefer to leave _num_ stars .
the pancakes were ok , a little mushy but flavorful .
i wish i could remember the other thing , but it was better .
when the bill comes , it is _num_ dollars .
and is _num_ dollars a glass .
drinking scotch in pittsburgh has been fun so far .
for appetizer , we had the kimchi pancakes , which were not fully cooked .
went to soba to celebrate my sons birthday .
quality of food was not at all what was expected for the price .
i wish they did n't put fried batter all over it though .
last i had the vegetarian curry dish , the only vegetarian main i found .
it was boring and not enough curry gravy with plain white rice !
the potatoes were also undercooked with not much flavor in the dish overall .
it was very cold .
everything took a long time to come out and the service was very poor .
needless to say i was extremely disappointed .
it was not enjoyable .
for the very first time the food was awful .
a pulled pork appetizer was passable , nowhere near the dish it replaced .
find a new chef quickly .
vietnamese beef noodles were bland and flavorless .
the menu lists them as including jalapeno , but there was no heat whatsoever .
very very disappointing .
thai corn soup jumbo crab ?
pad thai at a fusion place ?
tandoori salmon was average .
i still do n't understand why they served their fancy cream soda warm .
a cup given with no ice and a bottle of soda ?
why were n't their any ice in the glass ?
maybe it is really just me who prefer cold sodas .
show off how much money you can waste in a night .
after the renovation the place lost its center !
... another one bites the dust !
wrong !
the server went out of her way to make us feel uncomfortable .
no , we did not order any super fancy dishes .
lost _num_ stars for that .
it was horrible .
the fish was tough and the other dish was simply inedible .
this place is far too expensive to be serving food poorly prepared .
way too much hype for such underwhelming food .
sadly , i was grossly disappointed .
it was nothing that would make me want to come back .
it was sad , really .
but it was downhill from there .
it was dry and average , at best .
and fallen far .
it 's just not that good .
nothing special .
service is sketchy here at best .
first off , i can not comment on the food .
so , we were n't allowed to sit at the bar or a table .
those expectations kind of fell flat .
service here on a saturday night was atrocious .
_num_ after tip .
it 's good , but too expensive .
i do n't think the price worth the food .
the portion is too small .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i mean really loud .
i have never placed a bad review of a restaurant until now .
i will not recommend this establishment in the future .
not planning to come back and recommend everyone to stay away from this place .
painfully mediocre : small rolls , $ _num_ miso soup , drinks were reasonable .
rolls small lacking substance .
boring and expensive .
however , i 'm in pittsburgh , where can i go ?
these place are virtually the same .
no ... these bagels are about the same you would get anywhere .
okay bagels though a little overpriced .
have consistently had rude customer service .
really turns me off .
wo n't be going back even though the bagels are okay .
i 'm not totally sure why i keep going back here .
it was super busy and only _num_ employees were making food .
the coffee 's terrible .
poor customer service .
not worth the time and money to go here .
i go once or twice a week roughly , but never again .
but then again he knows everything is crap in his store .
it 's all crap .
do you like egg & bacon bagel sandwiches ?
they 'll cook the egg and bacon in their crap microwave for you .
tastes like crap but whatever , they serve it .
just like the butter and jelly packets sitting in the booth at denny 's .
but do n't feel this way .
the fellow who runs this crap store may be one .
was somewhat disappointed with my order from bagel factory today .
not horrible , just nothing to write home about .
i just found the worst breakfast spot in pittsburgh .
i 'm not kidding .
the egg and cheese were disgusting .
worst place ever !
bad food - ordered a bagel sandwich - yuck !
and the customer service was horrible .
apparently the guy was the owner , but he was beyond rude .
the coffee was expensive and tasted like dirt .
avoid this place as all costs .
we also tried the hummus which was pretty good .
friends ordered a chicken sandwich and a chicken salad .
they both said they were pretty good , if not a little dry .
then we had to wait _num_ minutes to get our bill .
she was not present for about _num_ minutes after we were sat .
she disappeared for about _num_ minutes before returning .
she served us our drinks then immediately left for another table .
she returned not long after and said she was alright .
i really could n't believe this .
what the hell ?
this place is going downhill fast .
first off , our waitress just was n't good .
bacon does n't take that long to cook .
so , that was really disappointing .
but it was n't over .
there were literally exactly four sad little pieces .
only because i live nearby .
this place just bored me .
really do n't know what to say .
bored , bored , bored , bored , bored .
mmm not too happy with my recent experience at harris grill .
we ended up with our glasses 3/4 full and a watered down juice cocktail .
ours was n't plain and simple .
harris grill , i think your menu is trying too hard .
first place i went on my visit to pittsburgh .
i do n't really have a good review for this place .
bland and overcooked .
it 's not even good bacon !
i have nothing good to say about this place .
waitstaff has a pretty poor knowledge of their own drink menu .
avoid harris grill .
this place offers really poor service .
the waitstaff go out of their way to not help you .
we stopped going after we got some serious attitude from our waiter .
i do n't enjoy doing it .
almost every time i have been let down .
appetizers : nothing really wrong here .
$ _num_ for two fish tacos ?
i do n't hate anything on the harris grill menu .
sure , harris grill gets crowded , especially on the weekends .
no apologies , no offer to comp a side or a dessert .
bad form , harris grill .
but truth be told , i 'll probably be back .
because i really want to like harris grill .
the food is not incredible and the service is always mediocre at best .
i thought the selection on the menu was pretty poor .
then the waitress asked me if i knew the chicken itself was spicy .
the menu said nothing about that , so i had no idea .
zero stars for service .
zero stars for price .
once seated , service was extremely slow .
_num_ min from when seated . )
service remained poor .
the place was mostly empty .
not so much .
terrible .
but again we watched table after table go empty and stay dirty .
and then the waitress only brought two of the three beverages .
the third took another _num_ minutes .
the menu was prix fixed at $ _num_ .
( they had run out of home fries ) .
my eggs benedict was good , so was my bloody mary .
that said , i counted only _num_ dishes with any vegetables at all .
the coffee was disappointing -- it came with plastic cups of half & half .
was n't impressed by their sunday brunch .
did n't like the presentation of the buffet .
the salad was made with iceberg lettuce and did n't look appetizing .
in all , it 's really nothing special , just very basic .
there 're not much options on the menu .
i tried the pasta once and it was tasteless .
so i was in need of a lunch and off to the garden .
two grape size tomatoes , and two thin slices of cucumber .
i do n't understand why this place is so popular .
i 've been there _num_ times and each time the food was pretty gross .
the only option for brunch is to get the buffet .
they were packed and could n't keep enough food out .
and , insult to injury , my bloody mary was watered down .
_num_ .
_num_ .
very hit or miss place .
i will never go back to this place again !
it was calamari on top of some salad with thai chili sauce dressing .
it is just disgusting .
i stay _num_ blocks away from harris grill .
what turns me off a bit , it always seems dirty .
the bathroom smells , the menus seem filthy , but i like the food !
terrible terrible service .
seemed cranky and overworked and ruined the experience completely .
ugh .
horrible experience .
salmon salad was not good at all .
will not be going back ever .
my _num_ star is as misleading as their drink menu .
we greeted her before she greeted us which i find rude .
she did not ask us anything when we were shopping .
she just sat there and read a magazine .
never , ever use these incompetent people for property management .
we 've had too many problems to list all of them .
we ca n't pay something if we do n't know how much to pay .
so completely frustrating .
the equipment would often break down and never get fixed .
it was hard to find a machine .
terribly overrated .
the actual equipment is ok , but the locker rooms are pretty bad .
the reason you would stick to this gym is the classes .
parking is difficult to come by , and you have to pay .
there has to be better gyms in the area .
terrible experience !
very disappointing and frustrating .
gross much ?
the gym also has barely any lighting .
its ridiculous and the policy needs to be changed asap .
update ... shadyside inn refunded the charges from our stay .
the building we stayed in was not full .
if i could give the place zero stars , i would .
great location but low on amenities .
`` it 's not coming off !
also most hotels offer no free parking , shadyside suites did .
the bedroom however seemed to dull car noise a little better .
hot water , not much of it low water pressure as well .
pros : it 's like living in an apt .
some of the staff has been friendly in providing things , including shuttle rides .
cons : extremely inconsistent room cleaning service !
the problem is , they do n't show on the assigned day to clean .
we stayed at the shadyside inn for months and spent thousands of dollars .
i really wanted to write a good review , but the experience was disappointing .
the quality of service from the staff was inconsistent .
and the elevator did not work at times .
we will not stay at this hotel again .
i 've never been so horribly treated in my life .
do not stay here .
nothing special about this place .
great location but the facilities are a little tired .
the management at this restaurant is horrendous .
i 've been here twice and i 'm just not crazy about it .
nothing is bad , per se , just not really impressive .
the big green salad was boring and everything was in huge chunks .
they have a hot vegetarian sandwich , but it sounds gross .
i would n't mind coming back for brunch .
she did n't rush us , and made good wine recommendations .
the burger was just a big slab of flavorless ground beef .
i could n't taste salt , pepper , garlic , anything .
their burgers are dead to me .
well , my update has half of my original rating .
i think she got _num_ out of every _num_ drink orders correct .
it was not crowded and we were seated and served promptly .
makes no sense .
worst eggs benedict experience i 've ever had .
additionally , i was not too thrilled with the atmosphere or beer selection .
the fries were fairly soggy and otherwise par for the course .
so tired of this place .
i thought maybe the cook was having a bad night .
the balsamic vinaigrette was straight vinegar .
where do you find apples and feta cheese with no taste ?
butter served with the bread was so hard it bent the knife .
pity .
the bloody mary was completely disgusting .
and there was no alcohol in it .
it was god awful .
it was the same bagel , they just stuck it in the microwave .
had a pretty bad experience last time i went here .
the artichoke dip was ok , but very greasy .
the pasta a bit dry and bland as well .
there is an ok number of beers on tap .
the main courses are very low quality .
honestly , there were _num_ people in the restaurant .
my reuben sandwich was just okay .
probably should have gotten a salad .
i 'm hoping that i just caught them on a bad afternoon .
my lil heart fell .
i do n't know how this place has stayed in business for so long .
the menu is boring .
lettuce was ice cold , nearly frozen .
i hardly ever send food back or complain but this was really bad .
this place is hit or miss .
i 've had good meals here , and i 've had really bad ones .
there 's no pride in the service or the food at all .
sunny only offered a free cleaning and even then seemed annoyed .
could not have been more patronizing .
i would n't recommend richard or the salon to anyone .
the second haircut was great , but styled horribly .
the third haircut was just awful : styled awful , looked strange .
i went into dean of shadyside salon to get my hair colored .
the worst part was checking out .
are you kidding me ?
not pleased with all the hidden costs behind my hair color service .
wo n't be back .
this explains why i got my haircut there so many times .
each visit was more bizarre than the time before .
overall , my haircuts were never good .
and i might add , he knew i was sitting there waiting .
so bad service .
i was their with groupon and they gave me so bad service .
due to 3-4 hours of service i split it into two days .
terrible !
the receptionist can not handle tips at all .
i left extremely upset and no one cared .
terrible customer service !
this is not an exaggeration .
i paid $ _num_ for a partial .
i think i 'll find a place that 's a little more ... me .
overall , haircut & style = _num_ stars .
the towel the girl put out had large brown stains on it !
mani = _num_ star .
the stylist did n't come back after a couple minutes .
when i asked the receptionist where the stylist was , she did n't know .
the next time i returned , i made an appointment with a different stylist .
they did n't even reschedule my appointment with another stylist when she did .
needless to say , i will not be back .
i 've tried to like dean 's several times over the years .
and each time i 've gone , my haircut has been ... .
)
but the overall vibe is weird and the service sucks .
the technique of the haircut is so poor .
i will not come for the second time .
the service was bad and unfortunately the haircut was even worse .
i tried dean 's because i had a coupon for a free hair cut .
he was very busy working on multiple people at the same time .
i was there for over _num_ hours !
richard does not make you feel comfortable .
i was not impressed with the atmosphere of the salons either .
- i will take my aunt to asians or school in north hills .
it was more than once that i heard glass breaking .
so i might not be the target audience .
the specials and menu prices are apparently wrong .
this is the worst lay out ever for a bar .
pricing is horrendous for beers .
weekend : dont bother .
i have never been treated so rudely by a waitstaff before in my life .
drink prices are n't anything special and cocktails are n't that strong .
went in there with friends knowing `` friends '' but everyone was rude .
unless you 're a local do n't go in there .
so i 'm not sure how much he 'd approve of this bar .
not a lot of character , but cheap prices .
needless to say , i will never come back here .
i use to pass by this place all the time .
this is a neighborhood denny 's with a bar .
at best , less than mediocre breakfast .
service was slow but they were nice about it .
ca n't comment on food since i was just in for beers .
crappy 's is more like it ... sorry i could not resist !
this place is very below average .
hot sauce was more difficult , took two requests before it came .
the food is basic and inexpensive , you get what you pay for .
so clearly lil off there ... other then that we order common breakfast .
further , they were unapologetic when i complained .
horrible brunch experience .
in my opinion , the is a prime example of a bad shadyside bar .
i 'd give this joint zero stars if it was possible .
this is the worst spot on walnut st !
i 'm not even sure where to start .
the vegetables were n't even cooked .
the food was terrible .
i would rather have eaten a mcdonald 's burger and fries .
overall terrible over priced food experience .
i would recommend never eating here .
so disappointed in food and its cost .
went for brunch and spent $ _num_ .
was n't great .
was there for over _num_ hours because service was so incredibly slow .
it was n't even super busy .
for _num_ girlfriends , they brought _num_ joint check .
then , they are n't even that nice !
rude , crowded , and most importantly not that great !
nothing stood out , including the famous burnt almond torte .
sorry , i grew up in pgh .
the filling in the middle had a bland taste , nothing special about it .
being a pastry chef myself , i had to try it .
i did like that the almonds stayed crispy even through shipping .
i ate one slice , and gave the rest away .
the almond torte used to be the best , hands down .
but , something happened sadly .
the cake part is now dry ?
go back to the way it was done before .
maybe i just got an old cake , i do n't know .
but i 'm really disappointed .
shame on you .
dirty and old looking bakery .
burnt almond torte is not as good as i expected .
not best cake in america by a long shot .
i 've experienced better '' ) because i have .
they were sold out at 2:00 pm on a thursday .
no thanks .
i was given a _num_ dollar gift card .
on top of that the cake was n't even fresh .
the chocolate was too sweet .
horrible service .
i have never been treated so poorly in a cafe .
the service was horrible and their coffee did n't taste great .
this place went from awesome to worst after it changed owners .
they used to have a white mocha but not anymore .
i miss the old owner of the place .
pitiful service .
pamela is a bad representation of this location !
attitude and lack of hygiene is an issue for this `` employee . ''
they frequently mess up my friends orders when we go there .
the toppings on my salad were barely there .
the salad has been greatly reduced in size .
cutting too many corners .
simply gross .
i should have looked or felt it before i left the store .
( all same kind of cookie ) .
apparently old cookies are standard here .
service is actually friendly , but slow , and all the employees are weird .
and the store is dirty , just as others have said .
avoid until this store gets its act together .
the district manager of this bakery to make sure it does not happen again .
that exchange was awkward too .
it is absurd !
these people are very unprofessional and rude .
my main complaint with them is that they lied to me .
one of worst patient experiences .
his staff is embarrassed .
will not go back there , ever !
did n't havana go out of biz ?
if not , oops !
i only go in to buy six packs .
she was rude and all over the place .
hummus is ridiculously expensive .
juice is cheap .
every time we go here , we come out highly stressed , which sucks .
drama , drama , and more drama .
the entrance to this location always smells like spoiled milk .
so incredibly frustrating !
not bad after hours but those hours are pretty narrow .
i woke up with a stuffy nose and in need of some hot soup .
this time it was runny bland mushy rice with extra mushy veggies .
gross !
plus i did n't feel great !
the small package was _num_ dollars .
selection of veggies are ok .
selection of fruit is a little below average .
however , lately i 'm becoming more and more frustrated by the store .
this is my third grocery store stop of the day .
for anyone who uses self checkout at this store do not forget your bags !
`` again i ask oh really is there nothing you can do ? ''
`` no i am sorry nothing we can do . ''
but going here is always such a nightmare .
the parking lot is miserable .
the aisles feel more narrow than they should be for a store this size .
the romaine is especially pitiful .
it 's come to the point that i avoid this place if i can .
i do n't care for this giant eagle , and that is being kind .
wo n't be back .
items do n't have price tags .
that 's the only reason why i gave them such a poor mark .
none of that .
same goes for milk , cold cuts and breakfast meat products .
they also have fake sales .
instead of about _num_ '' _num_ '' it 's about _num_ '' thick .
i went there for a few grocery items along with some alcoholic beverages .
the only thing that saved this store were the nice people that worked there .
this giant eagle market district is garbage .
the cashiers , pharmacy , and customer service manager were so rude and stupid .
_num_ hours to find the cold remedy i wanted .
but why support a business that really does n't care about you .
the `` customer '' service and pharmacy are terrible at this location !
i checked out as quickly as possible and nearly ran out of the store .
after _num_ years i 'd hoped they would have improved but i was wrong .
guess not .
i mean , i understand you do n't care about _num_ dollars .
i never really understood why doc 's was so popular .
i personally find its only real saving grace to be the outdoor deck .
the drinks are weak as well .
entrees were half off but all looked mediocre .
big groups of patrons led to pretty slow service .
the beer selection is n't that great and the upstairs bar is not full .
the service can also be rather slow .
cheese fries , burgers , some salads , mediocre pasta , etc .
my feet were still rough .
to be smooth after only one pedicure . ''
excuse me ?
it was horrible .
ignoring the fact that i was unhappy and i did n't like it .
she just kept trying to cover her ass instead of listening to my concerns .
the front desk girls were not friendly or helpful as well .
it 's an embarrassment on walnut .
if i wanted them in _num_ days i would have paid $ _num_ less !
no such luck , they said they were not able to do that .
and you just lost all of our business .
disgusting .
does n't even deserve one star !
however , the customer service here is absolutely awful .
tiffany prices with kay jewelers selection .
unfortunately within _num_ days one of the diamonds on the halo was missing .
i 'm sure that this is a fluke and will be taken care of .
however , this past visit was unfortunate .
the host was horrendous and extremely rude .
we were disappointed .
we mention our reservation , he says no problem _num_ min ... great !
okay , i know what you 're thinking why not just leave ?
i 've already admitted it 's nothing special .
but also way over prices .
really disappointing .
service is bad when you enter .
if it is busy expect to be treated poorly .
that will be ignored and you will wait like everyone else .
the food is poor .
the pasta was mushy -- way overcooked .
far too much cream and cheese .
did n't finish this dish .
my wife had a chicken special .
boring .
bland .
overall :
although there were some highlights , there were plenty of negatives to counter them .
not a good start .
disappointing .
not a good start .
_num_ .
very poor form on the owners part .
_num_ .
but when the bill came there was none of that .
i then turned around and walked out .
i have never been treated so badly as a consumer .
actually i will make sure to spread the word of this terrible experience .
and proceeded to scream at her for several minutes .
this was the most absurd display at a restaurant i have ever seen .
food was excellent but we hated the ambiance !
reservations at 7:00 pm saturday .
i guess that 's what they say to excuse the lack of proper a/c .
that completely turned us away from this restaurant .
very rude and unacceptable .
never going back .
ravioli , chicken breast , sauteed greens and a seasoned broth .
while the greens were decent , there were barely enough for a few bites .
we made the unfortunate decision to make a reservation here for a special occasion .
i wo n't be going here again .
luckily we had a fabulous dinner at another restaurant instead .
the owner has a complete disregard for customers and the customer experience .
we submitted our name thinking it would be 20-30 mins .
as tables became available he would seat groups that he knew and/or had reservations .
my friends had left this woman at least a _num_ % tip .
that is the prime reason why i would not recommend this restaurant to anyone .
the restaurant never called us , so we ended up eating elsewhere .
this time we literally got sat at a table in the kitchen hallway .
they should be serving free meals to anyone they stick at that table .
what a horrible experience !
it then took another _num_ minutes to get wine glasses .
this made everyone extremely uncomfortable !
the old guy continued to drink wine and yelled at another waitress .
so be aware they added an automatic _num_ % gratuity to the check .
life is too short to waste you time and money on this place !
very poor management .
very stupid management .
they do n't know how to do business .
they do n't help you to find a table .
come for the food and not the atmosphere or service .
i made reservations for _num_ pm on a friday .
the waitress who seemed to be rushed did not offer any recommendations .
aside from the poor service and chaos , the food was pretty good .
also , i was surprised by the limited number of seafood options .
the menu states there are _num_ market priced items .
prices were not listed on that daily special menu sheet either .
as dinner was my treat , i felt very awkward asking for prices .
note that risotto , the only entree with a price , is $ _num_ .
the beef turns out to be $ _num_ .
i personally would not go back , even though the food was fantastic .
treated badly .
the owner gave that table to a local group who showed up after us .
basically , reservations mean nothing here .
even if the food is great , the customer service is terrible .
unfortunately , the party stops there .
the main courses are extremely overpriced ( not unusual for walnut st. ) .
apparently it was a list of people that needed to be seated .
my husband and i left and i said we would n't be coming back .
so extremely rude .
can not justify giving money to someone who runs their business in that manner .
really though someone had to have messed up my dish .
deserts were nothing less than stellar , and the service was awesome .
i was shocked by how bad our experience was considering the other reviews .
the food was decently made and the environment was welcoming .
she said it was salty but the pasta was bland .
she took my bottle of wine and did not mention the price or anything .
most restaurants charge per bottle , not per person .
i may or may not come back .
not off to a good start .
i will not be coming back .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
overall not impressed .
so bland .
_num_ stars .
decor leaves much to be desired .
_num_ star .
fifteen minutes later , the waitress returned , but not with our food .
by this time , i was through with this place .
based on my experience , i wo n't be returning anytime soon .
i got the beef , the chicken & cilantro and the spinach empanadas .
do n't get me wrong , i wanted to like this place .
with all that said we tried all _num_ flavors of the empanadas they offered .
i ca n't even understand how people came to that conclusion .
the empty cup is still in front of me though .
i 've only gone because it is convenient to my location and reasonably priced .
i will never go back though .
not worth the hassle anymore & do a poor job .
way too expensive if you ask me .
it is such a rip off .
find someplace else in bloomfield .
is n't that why we bring clothes to the cleaners in the first place ?
they were returned to me a full size smaller than i dropped them off .
not very complicated .
also they lost my fianc 's work shirts .
will not be returning .
it was returned with a hole in back of suit jacket .
sorry to say that will be my last visit .
if someone had been standing there , this would have caused serious injury .
i just ca n't imagine having to deal with this a year .
the minus : the maintenance staff is always around .
their staff is horribly rude that way .
Neutral
thus , it makes me sad to write a negative review .
they are completely mean and disrespectful .
ps the maintenance staff are fabulous and deserve _num_ stars !
horrible in every sense of the word .
terrible !
it took _num_ months for them to resolve this situation .
at one point , they even asked me not to use the shower .
a year later , the ceiling in my bedroom began to leak .
i used my apartment as essentially a storage unit until my lease expired .
i have never in my life seen anything like it .
they do n't c are .
horrible !
they wo n't even bother to tell you that they will come !
not worth your money .
find a better management who does n't take your money and piss on you .
bathroom leaks atleast _num_ times a month .
very common problem in these apartments .
cant wait to move on .
the rent is too damn high .
if you sign a lease now it 's $ _num_ .
the hallways smell like hot garbage , always .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i was towed within _num_ hours after parking back there at ( 10pm ) .
( no where on the contract does it state that ! )
bingo , could n't have said it better .
it is not worth it .
they just broke into my house without any notice to show around .
then , before i was able to say anything , they broke in .
ridiculous .
i had no disclosure of this whatsoever when i signed my lease .
i do n't even understand how they have the time for this .
it 's absolutely disgusting , and you get no peace whatsoever .
now , i am stuck due to the heavy fees it would cost .
Negative
i 'm truly not out to get anyone with writing a negative review .
management did not even apologize for my inconvenience .
i thought this was way too much .
this was my big mistake .
)
, but instead they decided to take advantage of my position .
i do n't know .
they did not fix the building by the way .
also , my package was stolen twice .
they refuse to put a camera in the package room , parking lot too .
overall the rent keeps going up every year and their service just getting worse .
first of all , and the most important thing , they are not honest .
you pay fees , they make laundry and garbage more and more inconvenient .
elevator always has problems .
they do n't respect your privacy at all .
_num_ .
_num_ .
management said there was nothing they could do about it .
_num_ .
they 're all around rude to deal with .
wondered into this place looking for some mixed drinks .
but too much pamela 's seems greasy .
however , the pricing really is low when you 're lazy .
on top of it all , the coffee was horrible .
it looked like someone 's basement or garage with tables in it .
it 's like breakfast at most any other diner .
if you are dragged here by your friends , find new friends .
two words : grossly overrated .
unfortunately , pamela 's is neither of these things .
sadly , i walked away from my meal with a `` meh '' feeling .
first off , i kept hearing about these pancakes i got ta try .
they were super buttery ... too much so .
too bad .
ca n't beat it .
we had a terrible breakfast here not long ago .
plus the bread was poor quality .
the crepe pancakes were ok , but nothing to write home about .
we 'll be enjoying breakfast elsewhere in the future .
for pamela 's , we gave it a shot .
the restaurant was fairly busy with lots of customers chatting at their tables .
way too rich to finish .
not deserving of the rave reviews .
breakfast is cheap , and definitely very poor quality .
the waitresses were extremely fast , except for coffee refills .
that is a huge turn off , especially if you are out of town .
this place is n't worth going to an atm for .
they are super thin and crispy on the outside .
i also did n't love the service we received .
there are a few of them and there 's really nowhere else to go .
it 's sad .
this was just a joke and definitely not worth the wait .
we went on a sunday and i expected a wait , which was fine .
they were busy , but our waitress was slightly cold and barely around .
this was one of the most disappointing food experiences i 've had in pittsburgh .
it was average , but not restaurant quality .
the only thing that made it somewhat decent was sour cream and guacamole .
i ate about _num_ bites and left the rest .
it was n't worth even trying to eat for absolutely zero taste .
needless to say , we wo n't be going back for quite some time !
and , most sadly , the cup of coffee was weak .
not keeping with the the _num_ star yelp review that brought us here .
done in less than _num_ hours .
come now , i barely drink alcohol .
granted , i like to host social events .
however , i never ever will let a social event get out of control .
so here comes the story of walnut capital .
they complained that our house was not clean and scared off the potential tenants .
but we never let the house get to a point of disaster .
we always took the trash out .
never again will i rent from this company .
- chuck the driver for the shuttle is cool .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
under no circumstances should you sit down before placing an order .
so , my wife got up and we walked out of this place .
in fact , i did n't eat anything at all .
the restaurant is located in the basement of a building off of walnut street .
first , there are n't many tables .
my party and i left to go to another restaurant .
however , the crepes are extremely over price .
so over price that i can not afford a drink .
i 've chosen never to eat here again due to the staff .
the savory crepes were better than the sweet crepes which were a disappointment .
but it was the attitude of the owner that turned me off the establishment .
we were in a hurry because of limited visiting hours .
the prices on the menu do n't seem that bad .
but i still cant get over the fact there closed on mondays .
that aside , the crepes are okay , nothing special .
the other thing i do not like about this place are their hours .
i looked at my boyfriend who checked his watch while i checked my iphone .
Neutral
otherwise , negative stars would be in effect .
who on earth could possibly find this place worth returning to ?
what a completely miserable experience .
even the orange juice was bad .
the response and reaction that i got from her receptionist was quite rude .
i made an appointment weeks ago .
i said i could n't .
just totally inconsiderate .
they refuse to put anything on paper .
every thing about this place is wrong .
i should not be responsible for the bill .
they did not explain this to me when i register .
this place is the worst ever .
beware !
when we arrived there , however it was a different story .
we shrugged it off and went to the bar .
terrible service that night from an otherwise reputable place .
just getting off work , i came alone .
the walls are dark and decorated with wood and stained glass .
neither of us were surprised .
the food handling left much to be desired .
this was sorely lacking .
first thing i realized is that there 's no bathroom in the room .
since we were staying one night , this was a major disappointment .
the wedding manager nicole is ok , but nothing special .
it is clear that this is not her main priority .
not professional at all .
not a huge deal , but annoying since we asked them to do that .
unfortunately , it appears to be very poorly managed .
they were not met here .
that is not what you want to hear first thing in the morning !
there were no pictures hung in the room to improve the appearance .
the costumer service really ruined my experience .
awful customer service , rude and poorly managed .
it was not even $ _num_ including se day shipping !
the location also seemed a bit sketchy ; i 'd avoid this one .
try panera bread across the street .
we ai n't got no hashbrowns !
employees show no sense of urgency .
if any of the employees would smile i would die from shock .
do they train them to be rude and ignorant ?
do n't use the drive-thru .
but i quickly learned my lesson .
i got tired of spending _num_ minutes of my lunch break waiting in line .
no less than _num_ minutes .
the drive-thru is only slightly faster at 10-15 mins .
plus , the staff is rude .
big corporate america places only get one shot w us .
swing and miss .
worst wait times ever , staff is inefficient .
the drive thru line is always too long and moves too slowly .
also , the service is slow and poor .
worst wendy 's i have ever had .
i suppose , then , i should n't have been surprised by the food .
my moo shu chicken was mostly cabbage .
the food here was greasy , uninspired and bland .
i was also disappointed that they do n't serve brown rice .
not to be recommended unless you 're desperate .
i had to throw it in the microwave because it was no longer hot .
and they gave us some disgusting mustard sauce to dip it in . )
we used to visit this place most every time we went to pittsburgh .
the food is n't terrible , either , but it 's not great .
oh , and the lunch special pricing is not bad at all .
Negative
dim lighting that makes me want to sleep .
it 's not romantic , just dim .
the only waitress i 've had there is pretty rude .
my minimum tip is $ _num_ , even at the cheapest places .
the food is only okay .
i am never going to order their general tso ever again .
never ever whatsoever !
price is not bad .
why is it so hard to find a good chinese restaurant in pittsburgh ?
not all her fault .
not bad , a little tasteless , but why bother ?
nor good signs and we should have walked out then .
the worst chinese food i 've had .
there were bugs in my egg drop soup .
i ordered two orders of soup hot and sour and egg drop .
i only eat the hot and sour the night we ordered our take out .
looked like a bunch of fruit flies made their way into the soup .
disgusting .
the wonton soup was watery , and the wontons were inedible .
not very good chinese food here .
it reminded me of a cheap college place .
they give you plenty of food but it is low quality .
the rice tasted like a flavorless mush with chewy `` pork '' .
it tasted nothing like pork , or meat for that matter .
the soup was a weird creamy mess .
wrong .
cardboard .
cardboard with a strange tangy sauce and a side of disaster .
it was just awful and the service was terrible .
i looked around and there were only _num_ other people in the entire restaurant .
is n't that what they 're supposed to do ?
anyway , the food was not very good .
in fact , it was awful .
i 'm not sure they were .
there 's never any reason to be rude to your patrons .
no need to ever return .
after an hour of waiting , i called to check on our order .
i asked if it was out for delivery and she could n't tell me .
she could n't tell me how much longer we would wait .
the delivery driver arrived about _num_ minutes later .
horrible .
crappy service and food .
could not eat it .
waiter clearly did not know what he was talking about .
there are better chinese places on pittsburgh - this place should be shut down !
there is nothing chinese about the food !
general tso chicken lacks in chicken .
terrible service .
our food was cold .
i spent $ _num_ and only ate the fortune cookie .
did n't know you could mess up chicken lo mein .
delivery came somewhat cold , extremely bland .
very disappointed .
the service provided by a chinese man was terrible !
and the food was terrible too !
worst chinese food ever .
it 's either just decent , or just plain bad .
i 'm still trying to figure out how one manages to burn noodles .
this place is disgusting .
worst chinese food i 've ever had .
it tasted rotten and disgusting .
i picked out the broccoli and ate it over my side of rice .
worst chinese food i 've had in ages .
we ordered just soup and eggrolls for takeout .
the worst ever chinese restaurant if we can call this place as restaurant !
future actions : will not come again for sure !
at this point , one star is being generous .
after a noticeable drop in quality , i started ordering elsewhere .
my girlfriend ordered sesame chicken and it tasted like fish .
i had chicken and broccoli with limp foul tasting broccoli .
unfortunately , we threw out most of our entrees .
i will not be ordering here ever again .
i think people should know how awful this place is before stepping inside .
_num_ woman in the store were very helpful and knowledgable .
i have n't received my piece yet and its been about _num_ days .
everything else was of unremarkable to poor quality .
too pricey for the quality .
while it has a somewhat trendy looking menu , do n't be fooled .
while the onion soup was actually good , the rest was awful .
service was horrible .
very slow .
food was mediocre .
crab cakes were awful .
worse than eat park quality .
just said to try back again !
completely disappointing .
not too shabby .
salads , sandwiches , burgers and entrees we have all had before .
i had the walnut crusted salmon sandwich and jordan had the reuben .
french fries are pretty standard .
the food is lousy .
what a disappointment - i wo n't be back .
the service in this store is ridiculous .
why could n't they take a couple minutes and wrap our gift for us ?
i was so confused and annoyed that i just left after paying .
they just are n't nice .
the manager wears face earrings , how very unprofessional .
sure she knew that rude .
the place is dirty too .
delivery time was unimpressive .
that 's what i get for being lazy , probably .
otherwise , probably not .
man were they wrong !
we ordered a large steak stromboli with extra cheese through grub hub .
not even worth a star .
the hot wings i ordered came as plain breaded wings .
it was one of the worst pizzas i 've ever had .
first of all , the pie had almost no real flavor .
the dough , sauce , cheese ... even the pepperoni was bland .
i put some hot sauce on it strictly to add flavor .
on top of it , i got so sick .
my stomach was in knots for hours .
very cheap over breaded and not fresh at all .
the good : the ladies who run the registers are personable and helpful .
if it were n't so convenient i doubt i 'd go back .
my big issue is that the employees stand directly outside and smoke .
i get the location is close but it is not worth the grief .
i called two more times after this with no call back .
i would n't recommend going here .
there were _num_ customers ahead of me and _num_ ladies behind the counter .
i also plan to tell my family and friends not to shop here .
terrible service .
extremely rude lady works there on sundays .
the worst bakery i ever shopped in !
if given the chance again i would n't have another party here .
very cold to watch a game in even buy usual local rink standards .
made the same mistake 2x by going to these clowns .
could n't even call me to let me know .
drove down there so they could say sorry want to do it tomorrow ?
they 'll try to hit you with a bunch of unnecessary repairs .
do n't waste your time with this place .
just this last episode that has to deal with an inspection has me annoyed !
i have driven _num_ miles in the car since beginning of september .
so after explaining the situation they lower the price to $ _num_ .
not a bad place to look around while waiting for your order .
_num_ which seems to be a never ending construction zone .
the pizza was really greasy , and the bacon was minimal .
avoid .
worst nail salon ever .
not a smart move on my part .
the place was totally dusty and there was no ac .
i just kinda stared at her in shock , unable to speak .
it was just a bad scene .
it 'll never dry !
i would absolutely not return to this salon .
this made me question whether or not she was professionally trained .
what a complete waste .
i had a mani pedi today and they were brutal ... .
so painful !
the owner was sitting right there and did n't do anything or say anything .
please know that i hate leaving bad reviews .
and the pedicure was really really painful !
i would like to stress again though that my feet look awesome .
but i left stressed and bleeding !
i do n't know whats worse , terrible service or this filthy venue .
no wonder it is for sale .
do not get married here !
i would not suggest this bar to anyone .
we went here for easter buffet and the money it was not worth it .
the food was tasteless , place looked dirty , and rude waitress .
this place seems to have gone downhill since last time .
sorry , i gotten very used to no smoking i public places in pittsburgh .
ash trays all over the bar .
if i could give signature desserts _num_ stars , i would .
linda did not call .
this was the worst experience i ever had with business owners !
nothing was the way i ordered it !
i ca n't even begin to tell you how they treated me !
steve and linda were so rude and unprofessional !
just called to get information for my son 's birthday cake .
either way , no need for rudeness .
i bought pastries at this place several times before .
this place is run by korean women who are interested in providing extra services .
$ _num_ wasted because i never got my massage .
avoid this place unless you are looking for the happy ending .
had n't been here for several years , horrible disappointment .
egg rolls , wonton soup were not good .
i visited here at 6:30 p.m. on a saturday night .
there are about _num_ seating options , _num_ were used all the others empty .
first sign i chose to ignore .
nothing updated , nothing new , nothing fresh .
second sign i chose to ignore .
he was loud , very loud .
he was not asian .
white , and very loud .
there was no asian table or house workers in the front side of things .
third sign i chose to ignore .
nothing special in flavor or presentation .
perhaps leftovers from the _num_ steakhouse sale .
i sent all the food back shortly into the meal because it was cold .
when was the last time you ate chinese food that was cold ?
it 's never cold , never .
the tree died .
the salesperson walked away and proceed to start helping other customers .
after waiting for 5-10 minutes , she went back to the sales person .
she paid top dollar for the tree because she believed it was guaranteed .
she received neither .
the service was poor .
unfortunately the food was a let down .
my daughter ordered the fettuccine alfredo and it was quite bland .
the lady who runs the office is unpleasant and rude .
will not use this garage in the future .
sounded like i was flying a helicopter .
they just came up with some excuse .
careless workmanship is all you 'll find here .
i had a bad experience at penn automotive .
second , the lady at the counter is extremely rude and unpleasant .
i could have spoken to him in _num_ minutes and gotten out of there .
these folks are not honest and just want you out of there quickly .
have never experience such a rude interaction with a car shop .
this place has gone down hill fast !
the staff makes it feels like you are bothering them when you order .
and _num_ % of the time your order is wrong .
the drive thru is flat out dangerous .
cold food ?
try to avoid this location .
this is nothing new .
this has always been my least favorite wendy 's .
ugh .
the prices are downright insulting .
is that too much to ask ?
for a store the size of giant eagle , i expect more .
third , i 've personally had issues with meat quality here .
the first time , i thought maybe i just got a bad batch .
fool me -- you ca n't get fooled again . ''
lastly , i 've had some really poor customer service experiences at this location .
it 's annoying , i get it .
but my hubby did n't know any better .
but kayla , our cashier ?
completely unacceptable !
all right , now i 'm really done .
i 've eaten here several times and they are not very flexible .
they did n't .
they gave me another burnt sandwich .
worst customer service ever at the pharmacy here .
ridiculous .
avoid at all costs -- inefficient beyond belief .
i will not be back .
tonight is the last time i use this giant eagle pharmacy .
these people are the worst .
i get there only to find out they have nothing ready .
from there , it takes them another _num_ minutes to fill one prescription .
thank you for wasting my time , i wo n't be back .
why every time i come in here , it 's really hot ?
why every time i come in here , it 's really hot ?
better than subway , but not jimmy johns .
this place does not accept credit cards in the year _num_ .
overall just a really bad experience .
not sure about the food handling practices here .
tasted very good , but i was disappointed in how dirty this place is .
very rude staff .
i heard her talking about customers very badly .
i do n't mind them being cash only .
i do n't mind the unpleasant cashiers .
i 'm begging you .
i would n't wish this place on my own worst enemy .
i would n't wish this on the girl who cheated on my best friend .
he was very kind , but only dropped my food off .
the menu says there 's a charge for fried rice instead of white .
jimmy wan 's offers white and brown , no extra charge .
the atmosphere was atrocious .
the waitstaff saw what was happening and did n't care at all .
how were _num_ people in the _num_ seat restaurant and one small takeout order .
wan 's parking lot was jam packed and he ate with _num_ other friends .
he called me to pick him up as i was paying the bill .
the rest of the food was awful .
it was actually so bad that we asked to talk to the manager .
they were again completely flavorless , but warmer .
i could n't taste salt or pepper or garlic or even feel any heat .
it was awful .
i hated this food and this experience .
the staff was rude .
i closed the door and she walked away .
that was insanely rude .
this place is just not what it used to be .
this is the worst chinese food i 've ever had in pittsburgh .
honestly , it 's probably the worst i 've ever had .
i expected at least decent and i was extremely disappointed .
this place barely uses any flavor other than salt and msg .
unfortunately i heard after i ordered .
we were so excited to try this after all the hype .
last night we ordered take out and it left us disappointed .
mine needed a bit more sauce to make not as dry .
i 'm just not that excited for my lunch .
there 's not much left to say .
got chicken with string beans ( $ _num_ ) take-out .
the chicken was slimy and not many pieces at that .
this dish was smothered in sauce and had no flavor .
i will not order anything from this place ever again .
go to sesame inn in north hills and other locations .
i 'm not sure its all made in-house anymore .
moo shu has plenty of cabbage , hardly any meat .
paid $ _num_ for three early bird specials - all three were beef broccoli .
food is adequate but service leaves something to be desired .
after a lengthy wait we ended up sitting at separate tables .
delivery was fast but the food was terrible !
the egg roll was soggy and cold .
also , very expensive !
total for the above was $ _num_ !
hand me my order and cash me out ! )
we ordered spider sushi rolls , hawaiian chicken , and general tso chicken .
unfortunately the atmosphere did n't make up for the sub par food .
i 've had way better chinese sushi at giant eagle of all places .
it turned into a giant mess .
not sure we will be back .
i was sick to my stomach when i left .
the one rabbit is ( per statement vet ) not going to get better .
yet , he still drew blood and several yelled codes to the techs .
money trouble ?
because i 'm not prepared to pay $ _num_ for a single visit ?
my cat is not eating .
thanks , but no .
replied `` uh , it has to be printed '' .
actually , there are not `` two sizes '' of `` one scoop '' .
pretty disappointed in my service here the other day .
_num_ minutes of discussion for $ _num_ worth of food ?
so rude .
but my patience was not even worth it .
somewhat disappointed would best be the title for my review .
upon arriving i immediately did n't feel welcome .
it tasted like hot chocolate .
things like that really bother me .
bottom line : not terrible , but very underwhelmed by the coffee and service .
this place is dirty and the coffee is horrible .
ok i said i was sorry .
number of other guests is often zero - uncomfortable .
first and far most people , i never write a bad review .
actually , this is n't even a bad review .
the pad thai was not good and that 's what it should be !
i do n't care how many awards they have hanging on they wall .
just not going back there .
who cares what i think though , everyone has a different taste .
i have n't been here in a long time .
i should 've known better .
the waitress just was too young and inexperienced .
this visit was n't horrible , but definitely kinda unpleasant .
( seriously , i feel sorry for someone truly fat going in there ) .
um , not me , thanks .
truly , if at all possible , avoid her !
i 'm nothing if not organized .
but i already had a bad taste in my mouth .
it 's really too bad because as i said , her collection looks lovely .
but for those considering a long distance purchase , just beware a bit .
worst venue iv been to .
big mistake .
but it was n't during peak hours .
as noted by other posters the waitress was the bartender .
smoky , but not horribly so .
not sure why it would be featured on the show .
i get the same meal constantly and pay different prices everytime .
owner is rude & does n't handle customers well .
i will never place an order for me & my coworkers again .
terrible service , rude staff .
avoid this place .
while it was ok , it was n't great .
i wo n't be back .
ordered a glass of wine and beers for my companions .
sent one of my companions to get me some water .
they were frozen and certainly not worth the price .
the garbage and mail are very inconvenient .
it is just way too expensive to live like in a trailer park .
this place is terrible .
i am giving it _num_ stars only because the manager was nice .
the food was even worse than i remembered .
it was so spicy i could n't really taste anything .
and it was very annoying !
she did n't refill drinks .
the food was lukewarm when it arrived at the table .
my salad was missing _num_ items that were supposed to be on the salad .
not very appetizing .
asked for a manager , she never came to the table .
bad night ?
not sure and we wo n't be back to find out .
like two weeks ago when i stayed here for three days ?
you get off the elevator on the 5th floor .
bathrooms way too small i had to dry off outside the bathroom .
they really are the only thing this place has going for it .
luckily , it was n't an issue for me to move .
not so great ?
the hotel subs out the services for the business office .
not a good idea .
one of the people working said that was probably because of `` renovations . ''
the elevator moved really slow .
i think they probably deserve better .
the restaurant was worse for breakfast .
there were tables and servers ?
bad planning and execution ?
this school is a terrible deal for what you pay .
i do not support this unethical business practice .
i would give carolina auto repair no stars if possible .
i can not eat salad so ordered the soup .
turns out they do n't have soup .
turns out they do n't have mixed vegetables which is on the menu .
so instead of the rice i ordered a baked potato .
we got garlic bread which was too thick and not enough butter .
do n't waste your time or money .
my salad had a rotten tomato and a hair ( not mine ) .
the broiled flounder was n't very hot and neither were my steamed veggies .
both were so bland i could have prepared a better version at home .
my mom had spaghetti with meat sauce and said it was just mediocre .
i 'm sure they do but i had to spit mine out .
this particular location is horrible .
avoid !
avoid !
after _num_ minutes without getting closer to the register , i gave up .
this used to be my favorite local waffle house .
i walked in and was a little surprised .
_num_ separate different roaches in a matter of _num_ minutes in the same restaurant .
i will never be back .
the front waiting area was in mass confusion .
this is not an acceptable response for management .
this pizza hut is not a top choice , but ok in a pinch .
i had my _num_ year old with me and i 'm _num_ weeks pregnant .
we were starving waiting on our food .
another _num_ minutes pass and we finally got our order .
i live _num_ minutes from their location .
service was horrible !
not to mention , our order was wrong !
avoid at all costs ... .
this place is way over priced .
fired oysters and scallops over $ _num_ here .
if you use a teller you get charged $ _num_ for the month .
the food was awful .
but they do n't even seem to have subs .
tables were dirty .
well ok i guess .
the building is old and dirty .
never going back .
not one good thing to say .
so our entire meal that day ended up in the trash .
i was n't able to find the _num_ lb .
ball within the already limited selection .
food is limited and all fried , that 's not a good thing either .
i only give it _num_ stars because of the wait staff !
it is ridiculous !
they need to find new wait staff who are attentive and friendly !
does zero good to complain .
obvious they could care less .
worst mcdonalds in the united states of america .
i could get food faster in a prison cell .
most fast food places fall in the the meh category for me .
the employees did not seem to care and had no sense to work faster .
avoid !
and a lot has changed for the worst unfortunately .
horrible !
not to mention they do n't fill your drink !
the gun shot great , unfortunately the staff and facilities were well below par .
i have spent a lot of time at shooting ranges both indoors and out .
i will not be a repeat patron .
he warned me about this place ... should have taken his advice .
rude , disrespectful jerks who should not be dealing with the public .
like i said , i wo n't be back .
we did n't , as this was our first visit .
the range itself had terrible ventilation .
sweating at the lanes while trying to hold a loaded gun .
no bueno .
the lighting was poor .
my biggest complaint is pricing .
$ _num_ per hour per person ... with an one hour minimum .
most indoor ranges charge by lane , not person .
customer service was poor and unfriendly .
the bathroom was gross .
they will not get another dime of mine .
same guy , same attitude .
if you 're desperate for chinese , get it to go .
went a few times and the last visit made me sick .
i was very disappointed with new china .
we got the curry chicken , beef with broccoli , and crab rangoons .
i would highly encourage others to go elsewhere .
i will not return to new china .
the staff is rude and store is usually very dirty .
get your wallet ready , the prices are crazy high !
nothing to brag about .
but last night it took _num_ hrs to get a burger .
management did n't even come by table to apologize about the wait .
here for trivia night on tuesday night .
good food but this is ridiculous .
they need to get some help in here or people will stop coming !
the hollandaise sauce was sour and had a horrible vinegar taste to it .
just had the worst experience at a nail salon .
so i did n't pay for the white .
absolute worst experience at a nail salon .
my acrylics now look like crap , and i have cuts on my cuticles .
my friend 's nails looked like a _num_ year old did them .
this was the worst gel manicure experience i 've had .
all the techs are nice except the man ( andy ) he is horrible !
he can not get the shape right to save his life .
my acrylic nails are crooked and shorter than i asked .
on top of that he is very rude and has no customer service skills .
i have left bleeding twice .
the staff 's attitude is straight out of the big apple .
we did n't have a problem taking it to go .
would n't recommend going out of your way for a slice .
what happened ?
hoping it 's just been a bad few nights .
but last few times i have gone it has not taste the same .
crust not cooked enough etc i hope this is not a trend .
parking is atrocious .
however i was n't treated well and i wo n't go back .
just awful customer service .
we were disappointed .
firstly , this place used to be free to the public .
but this was our first visit , and we wo n't be back .
it looked like they had not worked on this field in many months .
also had to dodge many foul balls .
okay , so maybe that night we just had bad luck ?
our greeting at the front desk was awful .
she was appalling and rude .
another $ _num_ .
very sad that there are people out there taking advantage of per owners .
this is on a weekend ( saturday night - sunday morning ) .
as a customer i really do n't care .
i 'm glad this place is for emergency service only ( for us ) .
when the tech returned with my dog she did n't say a word .
alot of money for very poor care .
i will not be going back .
this pizza is mediocre at best .
no thank you .
i got a medium _num_ topping and this pizza was very bland to me .
from my first bite it was missing something ... flavor .
wo n't be going back .
the pizza is very soggy and the salad is brown and mostly inedible .
they ripped me off .
i paid over $ _num_ for _num_ large cheese pizzas .
they do n't even have a restroom for customers !
this is the burger king that corporate forgot .
king nasty !
just awful .
the last time that we went there he had our car for over week .
we called again and he said that they could n't find our car keys .
i have n't use their service yet .
i stopped by to see them , asking them to give me a price .
i gave them all my contacts information to reach me .
they seems not care to lose a customer , it is disappointing .
no return call either .
do n't bother .
i wish i could give less stars .
i told her that was no problem .
she not only lost out on a past customer .
owner on the phone and did n't even acknowledge the customer .
food was awful .
szechuan beef tasted like ketchup .
it is too bad i ca n't give this zero stars .
i had kung pao chicken and got really bad food poisoning .
the chicken was all dark meat and tasted aweful .
food was terrible and woman who rang me up was soooooo rude .
chicken chewy and rubbery .
last two years have noticed quality of food sadly going down .
couple of years ago more orders were found to be overcooked and less meaty .
i brought my order home , found three pieces of chicken , overcooked .
sorry panda ; this loyal customer has had enough .
it was indeed pretty horrible even for $ _num_ per medium .
do not go for the pumpkin patch !
it 's really sad actually .
the installers were knowledgeable , friendly and efficient .
my main issue is that i did not receive what i paid for .
very poor customer service , and that 's too bad .
so frustrated .
i just do n't know how a business in _num_ can operate this way .
them stood behind some policy that they could n't sell parts .
they came out on a sunday which is much appreciated .
one week later it was empty again .
i wasted $ _num_ for nothing because they did n't do a through job .
i booked this hotel stay for a business ( military ) event .
we booked a total of _num_ rooms with them and checked in individually .
i was a little dissatisfied in how poorly i welcomed to the hotel .
the cable and internet did not work our first night there .
the room had a musty smell to it .
it was not superior by any means but very nice for the average express .
the parking situation is horrible .
she did not greet me as i opened the door .
she did , however , return quickly with a hair dryer .
most of the staff were borderline rude or down right rude .
the breakfast area was incredibly crowded .
the morning of checkout my bill had not been placed under the door .
worst service in the area , by far .
i have eaten at this restaurant before and the service was n't so bad .
food was ok , nothing much to speak of .
he said that he could not take it and referred me to the manager .
they said if i printed it out , i could have used it .
he did not understand and said , no coupon .
none of the regulars were there .
do n't waste your time coming to this hole in the wall !
made me walk across the floor after my pedi w bare feet .
i looked down and saw dirty toe nails and finger nails on the floor .
gross !
worse nail salon i 've ever experienced .
nails looked nice but only lasted about _num_ and a half days .
no heavy lifting no reason for my nails to be breaking left and right .
do not waste your time or money there , you will regret it .
unfortunately , that did n't happen .
when i walked in i gave them my name and paid for my order .
but then i had to wait more than _num_ minutes to get my food .
unacceptable .
if i had not already paid for the food , i would have left .
my sandwich did n't even have true tomato slices .
just chunks of tomato .
this was such a sour experience .
i wo n't be back .
we got two hamburgers and an order of chili cheese fries .
save your money on the chili cheese fries .
and cheese sauce that you get for your nachos at the gas station .
i have been here a total of four times .
sure enough , a few minutes later it was on my table .
the portions here are huge ( the one constant ) .
next week i happily tried to repeat the last order i got .
ended up just getting plain strips with honey mustard on the side .
drinks are far too expensive to try any .
the wings and cheese fries were disgusting .
do n't recommend buying a car of another make here .
only after the third time returning did anyone apologize .
so fool me once , shame on me .
i consider it a blessing that it did n't work out .
very rude service was in line for ten mins .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
most places charge _num_ to _num_ dollars .
i thought it was from a sloppy oil change .
so much for trying to support local business .
it 's not .
holly on the way to _num_ .
every order is wrong .
too bad even then the orders are not right .
what 's worse ?
nothing changes even when they are n't busy .
avoid this location .
most time i wait so long i end up going inside .
the cheapest thing on the menu was $ _num_ .
when it was time to get up the breakfast food was bad .
they charge for internet service in the room , that 's so _num_ !
but it 's not good for longer stays or repeat visits .
half of the floors do n't have vending machines .
one of the floors that does does not offer drinks .
internet access is $ _num_ per day .
it 's missing most of the things that make longer stays tolerable .
answer : pretty bad !
it was a tired person 's worst nightmare .
i 'd say , skip this one .
we booked this hotel to stay during an overnight layover in charlotte .
that 's just nasty !
so i went through the whole thing for nothing .
there are no decent food options within walking distance .
the beds are very comfortable so you can get a good night 's sleep .
however , as a guest , i would not go back .
she did n't offer any ideas for help and was quite frankly , rude .
i had the same problem on my laptop , ipad and iphone .
it was n't me .
others in our group had problems as well .
not convenient for an early flight .
this hotel is really dated , and the rooms smell funny .
night manager tried to enter my room at _num_ am while i was sleeping .
my sleep and stay was ruined .
i 've contacted the hotel manager twice and have received no response from her .
the hotel itself is ok .
the bed was comfortable enough and the room was mostly clean .
it looks like they do n't vacuum very often .
the room i had was bland , one piece of ugly artwork .
open closet reminiscent of a motel _num_ .
it was clean , but nothing to note otherwise .
she was told that they only have one cart !
this is a pretty big hotel , so that is ridiculous .
we simply ordered _num_ bagels , coffee and tea for breakfast .
oh yeah , the ac sounds like a _num_ taking off above your bed .
i 'm sure you can find better accommodations in this price range and location .
there is nothing to eat within walking distance .
not delivering .
i do n't need to spend my money there .
could n't do that !
im never going back .
delivery was good for a salad but for everything else i was sadly disappointed .
no this was just gross .
my noodles were cold ... like really cold .
i will say it was cheap and the spring roll was edible .
service was terrible !
i am disappointed the table i was most concerned about is horrible .
avoid at all costs !
upon receipt she told the manager she could n't see clearly .
the doctor confirmed her prescription was accurate and the glasses were off .
do not shop here , it 's not worth the risk .
they are so rude do n't waste your time here .
i made a change in frames less than _num_ hours from original order .
was told there would be no problem .
mine were n't made because they had the wrong size lens .
this store is terrible .
took _num_ days to pick up the cut sofa !
they were then _num_ hours late picking it up !
terrible .
assistant manager says he had no way to contact delivery people for assistance .
please save your money and visit another store or company .
terrible .
it took _num_ 1/2 months for my office furniture to arrive .
in the mean time my sales rep was fired apparently .
this is not what you promised to sell me .
gag !
the clerk said she was sorry .
garden ridge is not the same ... it has really gone downhill .
their shopping carts are all rusty and broken .
i miss the old garden ridge .
is it me or have the prices at garden ridge gotten ridiculously high ?
no wonder the store was empty .
i called garden ridge to speak to a customer service rep .
gave me a texas number .
too much trouble .
too many other competent companies to model after .
im _num_ from ohio .
i shop alot , sometimes too much .
not very impressed with my last two trips here .
they ended up calling two more over , but it took way too long .
but you know what words i do n't mind hearing ?
`` unfortunately we do n't have that information . ''
`` apologies for the mistake .
that 's not our usual practice . ''
i 've visited this store _num_ times .
only _num_ times .
first time nothing unusual happened .
i walked around .
i 'm not asking too much .
shes says , `` they 're not '' .
no sorry or who told you this .
smh ... customer service is clearly not on their priority list .
i guess it does n't have to be .
they know they 're going to get customers in regardless .
i 'll limit my visits until i find that treasure .
although i love the store , this store has horrible customer service .
breakfast was good .
was checking in and they completely lied to me about having a separate room .
i could not believe how filthy this store was .
the employees could have cared less as well .
so disappointed .
most of the bags that contained these watches were missing something .
i went back to the counter to find a different manager .
after going through each bag , i could not find the correct band .
thank you for horrible customer service and a useless watch .
i wish there were other options of stores similar to them in the area .
they are apparently saying i cant cancel a custom order .
am i still expected to keep waiting ?
these people are very difficult to do business with .
will take my money elsewhere .
if they say yes , the bread is likely to be eaten .
btw , we did n't have an inexpensive lunch .
if not , then go .
i dunno .
horrible .
as another reviewer said it was set up weird .
should try ordering from the menu it might be better .
i was disappointed with the selection of food as well .
my husband let me try a bite of his rueben which was really good .
first off , the beer menu .
ultimately , i was n't very impressed .
i just did n't want to create a scene in front of my guest .
i was expecting something stellar , and i feel rather let down .
this stuff looked and tasted more like doughy noodles .
it was tasteless , and the fruit center was nothing more than filler .
we ca n't believe it .
we can not , therefore , understand the rave reviews .
to each his own , i guess .
the waitstaff are very unprofessional all standing around and talking loud near your table .
i drove _num_ minutes for overpriced `` german '' food .
i will not be coming back at all .
no thanks .
that is the most ridiculous thing i 've ever heard .
it is definitely not _num_ days free with no questioned asked .
slowest deli department in town .
i was unable to justify spending $ _num_ or $ _num_ for their membership .
was also told i get free $ _num_ gift certificate at restaurant.com .
i try calling bj 's and wait over _num_ minutes on hold .
no offer to adjust my membership so i ask for $ _num_ refund .
_num_ weeks and so far no refund has hit my account .
the food was not prepared well .
the baked potato was awful and the service was mediocre .
this has only been my 2nd time at a red lobster ever .
i have had better seafood elsewhere .
we were seated quickly for a friday night and the server was fine .
the seafood was a little undercooked and everything was dripping in butter .
red lobster was not the place to be tonight .
the service was horrible .
it seem to be over before it started .
_num_ minutes later , she finally brought it back for me to sign .
never received a refill on my soda .
terribly ran !
food takes forever and it does n't come out right .
the wait staff is slow and management has no clue .
but rather good could n't complain .
it does n't !
the only good thing was that the cheese biscuits here are bomb !
everything else is a joke .
i 'm not big on chain restaurants .
not because the food is bad but because i like to try new places .
i see why this restaurant is rated so poorly .
the clientele , for some reason , really made for a loud dining experience .
our waitress was hit or miss and we waited awhile for the bill .
would not visit again .
worst service i have ever had .
the waitress the first time i went was a little short , not personable .
the second time about 2-3 months later was just awful .
i was there on a weeknight , for over _num_ hours .
i just do n't even know what to say .
it made my whole experience disappointing .
i wo n't go back to this location .
our salad and bread came out with our food which was a little irritating .
he was great but everything else was extremely slow .
i really ca n't imagine what could be making it so slow here .
just got back from dinner which took over _num_ hrs .
i hate to blame the kitchen , but i think it 's the kitchen .
plus my caesar salad had slimy wilted lettuce .
food was mediocre as well .
wo n't be coming back .
boxes and toys were all over the floor in the store .
the store needs a major overhaul and some employees who care .
terrible service .
the message to me is management must be blind & ignorant .
the store would not cash out the remaining balance on the gift cards .
this place sucks big time as far as cleanliness and order .
are they going out of business ?
i made a very simple order online -- very difficult to screw up .
huge disappointment .
the sub was not one bit better than subway .
this was a complete waste of my time and money .
my bill : $ _num_ .
no complaints there .
the to-go process makes me want to bang my head against a wall tho .
um no , its like $ _num_ extra for delivery .
not cool .
my advice is anyone picking up a to-go order is to do the same .
the restaurant was clean and the people working were friendly .
wo n't visit again .
waiting in line took roughly _num_ minutes on a tuesday about _num_ noon .
i asked for an estimated wait time , not how many appointments there are .
bad business practices are very disappointing .
that is not a way to earn anyone 's business !
just gon na stand here and get looked over for a little while longer .
decent furniture but wow was i disappointed by the payment process .
why is n't this practice illegal ?
it 's sad to experience systems that work so obviously against the customer .
he just put it on the bill .
worst customer service ever !
ashley furniture will get my business from now on .
at first they said they are unable to do so .
the quality of the furniture turned out to be very poor .
the store told them that they have problems with that manufacturer all the .
to date the store has done nothing to replace the defective furniture .
the worst customer service ever !
they already had my money , so why be courteous now ?
that 's is bad business !
she was super excited and counting down the days until arrival .
they have completely horrible , rude customer service reps .
tried to call corporate and let 's just say they could care less .
thinking back and forth on it did n't seem right .
i was ok with this and it sounded fair enough .
well i went there on january _num_ to return my mattress .
did not want to buy another mattress online .
most places allow return of items within _num_ days , even if a mattress .
it was awful !
this is by far the absolute worst furniture experience i have encountered .
the sales lady made an annoying appearance every ten minutes .
at this point , my patience are very thin .
i mean really , this is ridiculous .
my god the sun will be coming up soon !
that was unacceptable .
the main waiting area is also empty .
they next wanted to try my hands and i refused .
i will never have another mri done there .
the baby starts coming out : doctors runs in my room .
terrible treatment .
if you have an emergency do not come here .
go here to die !
i went here after a car accident that was not my fault .
and i felt like total crap the whole next day at work .
they gave me my cast and i left at _num_ .
i can not be refunded and the bill will be sent .
self checkout is the only option and is a joke .
employees would much rather carry inappropriate conversations for the work place than assist .
sorry wo n't be back !
if no stars could be given that would be more accurate .
this store , however , is definitely lacking in customer service .
no way , no how .
we left , went to the charlotte store and they were amazing .
i called back at 10am instead .
some rude nasty woman answers the phone !
next time your country ass needs to stay home from work .
the person checking me out was not hospitable .
went here and of course had the worst experience getting my bridesmaid dress .
stick to a boutique if you want real customer service .
she did n't say a word to us .
they had _num_ opportunities to assist us with the process and ignored us .
they could n't find it in the `` on holds area '' wth ?
we felt bad , and stuck around .
bad idea .
there is _num_ minutes left to pick and try on dresses !
lost sale opportunity .
a very frustrating moment indeed .
the other staff were horrible !
another lost sale opportunity .
they lost out big time with me .
i open the bag where my dress was and i was so dissapointed .
my problem is with the alterations department .
they also rushed me during my final fitting .
very rude and unprofessional , do n't go there !
brandy was the worst .
if she 's the best , i would hate to see the worst .
do not get your alterations done at this location !
they charge at least $ _num_ more for bridesmaids alteration of a short dress .
the hem was n't even touched and they charged me $ _num_ .
they lack skills .
$ _num_ ?
this whole department is insane .
glad this is all over .
this store is not customer service friendly .
that should have been my first clue to walk away .
so i asked how to return it and he did n't know .
my real complaint is just how rudely we were treated at both locations .
worst service i 've had in a long time .
it was just me and my mom and i just wanted to browse .
so that was weird .
what a horrible experience !
i also came in many times before and the employees never helped me .
they were just sitting down doing nothing .
i am definitely disappointed .
i would n't even give them one star at this location !
this was the worst service and experience i have ever received !
the ladies at the reception desk are horrible !
i called to order contacts and they were utterly confused .
terrible place and i would not recommend this facility to anyone .
i said to myself , this is unsanitary practices being used here .
i asked for a full refund , i was not spending my money here .
this restaurant is so gross and it 's dirty .
but this location puts the name to shame .
are you kidding me - not even inspected prior to delivery .
poor attention to detail , poor quality .
poor follow up .
the guy was obviously knowledgable about mattresses but he was rude and condescending .
tried to pressure me into buying a bed right then and there .
neither of us were impressed .
so if this was based on food i would give buca a _num_ .
two and a half stars , neither a-ok nor real bad .
the lunch portion was huge , too much in fact .
service was absolutely dismal for no good reason .
it was neither busy nor a late hour for lunch .
it was loud and crowded .
needless to say ... i will never go there again !
every time we have eaten here , we were hungry shortly after .
very dim lighting somewhere between romantic and creepy .
it is a little overpriced even with coupons for the quality of food .
at least with this experience , did not have the best server .
he did not seem to be too enthusiastic with his job .
no hurry to go back there ... ever .
i do n't know if i can ever return to buca .
firstly , i knew there was something wrong with the server when we arrived .
she just seemed ... off ... or high .
ok , i did , and i stopped eating .
there is nothing worse than someone else 's hair in your food .
so , i kept quiet against my better judgement .
confused !
i just started laughing , i was sure this entire night was a joke .
holy ... cannoli ... get me out of here !
sorry buca , a previous visit was much better than this one .
so disappointed !
you really seem to care about this restaurant 's reputation .
he said they 're making improvements and that i should try it again .
i was n't as impressed with buca as i wanted to be .
the only thing mixed about this salad was the iceberg and red cabbage .
it was just okay as a whole .
for our main dish , we got the large order of spicy chicken rigatoni .
it just was n't as authentic as i was hoping for .
they had _num_ hostess up front doing nothing and did n't even greet us .
why would you even try to seat us like that ?
reason i book reservation is to have enough seats ahead of time .
she gave me an attitude .
terrible customer service and it was my birthday .
disappointment .
will never return to the restaurant .
disgusting !
worst italian food ever !
they should n't even call it italian food .
the bread was even bad .
do n't waste your time and money going here .
i was less than impressed .
the meatballs were greasy and very bland .
the price was extremely high for food that was bland and not impressive .
seriously , how many f words can you not use on a yelp review ?
salad came first then bruschetta ( wtf ) toast and tomatoes and cheese .
came out fast , but entre 's came out _num_ mins later .
it was n't bad , just nothing great .
its like the place tries too hard .
as if the food is not the real star of the show .
my server lost me towards the end .
instead it 's a runny broth at the bottom of the bowl .
once again we leave this place unhappy and dissatisfied .
this food is just crap .
i made sure i asked for extra sauce ( just in case ) .
needless to say i was disappointed again !
terrible !
it was also barely cooked , not crispy at all .
what a disappointment !
the fist time after a _num_ minute wait , they brought the wrong food .
they gave us a $ _num_ gift card to make up for it .
avoid !
worst customer service .
staff very rude .
never had problem at other locations .
will not return at this location !
mama ricotta will be a better option .
management very rude and customer service is very poor .
yes , that 's not long , but it 's definitely boring .
i do n't like this place , nor the food .
strange odor - musty old smell .
other table was trying to check out and the bartender and manager ( ? )
very noisy .
_num_ .
but a $ _num_ dinner for _num_ i expect more .
birthday celebration & dessert is n't free ?
service was sub par at best .
last nights visit to buca was less than i expect from this restaurant .
the service was awful .
we were very disappointed .
$ _num_ bill for four -- sorry i expect much better service !
the drinks and salads are also soooo pricey .
nothing special .
the visit i am reviewing was for take-out .
nearly _num_ minutes after that time , my order was still not ready .
it appears this location has a serious management issue .
it more than less ruined our dining experience .
this was a very disappointing dining experience .
we ordered _num_ family portions of _num_ different dishes .
the spaghetti and meatballs were very bland .
the only dish we liked was the chicken dish .
completely ruined our meal .
so this past friday i held a birthday dinner for my mother here .
things quickly got off to a bad start .
the staff would not know i had once asked for that room .
however , i will never return to this place .
ok italian food , portions are big , but you pay for them .
service was ok , birthday dessert was a bowl of whipped cream .
when i walked in and looked over the menu i too was excited .
unfortunately the food did not come close to my expectations .
baked ziti is supposed to have a lot of cheese and sauce .
is n't that what baked ziti is ?
and the veal was dry .
not good customer service .
unless you have no other choice do not shop here .
the store is horribly dirty and the prices are higher then harris teeter .
this place sucks the cashiers are either very rude , slow and incompetent .
unfortunately , the service is some of the worst i 've experienced in charlotte .
they all looked at me , none greeted or walked toward me .
none of the three ever tried to assist .
false advertising on patio furniture .
overall , the look of the store just seems to be tired .
never will be coming back here again .
worst customer service ever !
seriously i waited in the drive thru for like _num_ minutes .
( i was _num_ cars away ) .
i 'm stuck between two and three stars .
after all it is taco bell .
you can usually count on them for cheap and fast food .
the cheap part is always standard .
but , the fast part for this location has struggled for a while .
although , i do really have zero complaints on the food .
after all it is taco bell .
excuse given was understaffed but when you are not busy it does n't fly .
what an ordeal !
despite the cost of the set we had to pay $ _num_ for delivery .
or , they can pick-up the entire set and provide _num_ % credit .
no consideration to the value of our time .
the hostess was very short with me and my date .
no personality and did n't make us feel welcome .
no personality , still .
my date did n't like her steak either .
things have really slipped since then though .
they drowned my salad in ranch dressing and cheese ... .
my soup was alright - french onion - pretty standard .
we like longhorn , but not this location .
the service here is mediocre at best .
when we eventually got the appetizer the bread , there were no plates around .
_num_ more minutes to get plates .
my caesar salad was sour and otherwise bland .
worst experience in a long time .
our waitress did not seem very enthusiastic .
no such luck .
the only employee i could see in the entire restaurant was the bartender !
from the other reviews it seems i did n't miss anything .
this used to be my favorite steak house in charlotte .
it 's really gone downhill lately .
the last _num_ times i 've eaten here the prime rib was still cold .
he brought it back still cold .
they get two for the great service but everything else was not so good .
her corn on the cob was undercooked .
we will not be coming back again .
probably why ... carlos the manager is cheap and not customer friendly !
our server jeff was the worst waitstaff i 've encountered in many years .
that he did n't know there was a problem ?
that he had been there _num_ months and never had a complaint ?
i wish i would have taken a picture .
i could n't believe they tried to pass that off as a steak .
it 's not a very good longhorn .
my hubby ordered coffee , cobb salad and filet .
no complaints .
his salad had no issues so all in all it was what we expected .
our expectations were not too high and the restaurant delivered just that .
it 's not .
i would not recommend going to this best buy location .
then customer service wouldnt help me .
after waiting another five to ten minutes someone finally came .
no thank you or thanks for you patience .
he put the tv in my truck turned around and walked away .
absolutely horrible customer service !
the worst best buy i have ever visited .
back and forth a total waste of time .
then the manager told me we would not have sold one in the condition .
but they sure sold it to me .
horrible service .
horrible customer service .
only _num_ people in line when arrived .
_num_ minutes later _num_ people still in line .
ridiculous !
horrible is the word .
horrible business practice here .
do not shop at best buy .
they 'll gladly take your money , however , good luck getting issues resolved .
there was a long line and only one employee at the checkout .
they have no clue what the word `` toasted '' means .
the lox bagels are not even made open face .
not going back again .
i got back to my office and the bagel was not toasted .
not the best or the worst mall in charlotte .
they would n't even give us a couple minutes to settle our child down .
i will not be back to see year people again !
gave this mall yet another try again today , disappointed again .
all the regular stores , plus some of the more trashy ones .
which on the mall alone would be _num_ star !
this was the worst customer service i have encountered in awhile .
nothing !
i went to exchange a product , instead i just returned .
i chose the fiesta chicken chopped salad and new chicken tortilla soup .
the chicken tortilla soup was just ok .
overall , the experience was horrible .
the service was horrible .
so if you 're coming to drink ... not so bad .
if you 're coming to eat ... ah you might think again !
i was disgusted .
yes i know sometimes things could land i 'm my food .
she then went to get our drinks .
very visible and inappropriate .
i wish i could give a no star review for this location .
the only bright spot was the waitress .
the runny quinoa was a mess and hard to boot .
the pasta at applebee 's are definitely not worth the $ _num_ they charge .
the portions are way too small and not good at all .
we went here with family to have lunch , the service was ok .
that was not to be found here .
the food sucked .
just a mess .
total mess .
please do not use this location .
they do not take responsibility for their mistakes .
it 's a shame , because it was a beautiful gift .
do not do business with these people .
shortly after , another lady comes over .
clearly , i was never meant to know the price of this ring .
the same style etc , just a different ring that fit .
just a bit uncomfortable to see how much someone spent on an engagement ring !
i was very unimpressed with this olive garden location .
secondly , the kitchen is one of the worst in the entire company .
anyways , horrible experience .
the table they sat us at , smelled so badly !
i did not even want to put my purse down .
this made my food experience not good .
the place is just older and needs some renovations .
the place is not clean , the table we sat was sticky .
the deal also comes with either a small app or a dessert to share .
the spicy sausage soup she first ordered was mostly broth .
want a zero star option !
i am a fan of olive garden but this one is horrible !
ended up with _num_ meals un eaten .
we got there around _num_ and had no wait for a table .
breadsticks and salad came out like expected .
the breadsticks are alway delish and hard to turn away eating more .
he ate it and did n't complain ... .
this is probably one of the worst olive garden i have been to .
my server was horrific .
i am completely disappointed .
she and i were both a little nervous about getting poor service .
he said , `` no , absolutely not .
throughout the entire order , we got nothing but attitude .
but the rest of the place , not so much .
could someone have asked us if we wanted a drink ?
otherwise , it would have been pretty good .
i know , i know -- olive garden , how pedestrian of me !
when we sat down , i was immediately hit by a gross smell .
it smelled badly like wet dog .
how disgusting .
the bread sticks were pretty underwhelming -- there was no garlic or flavor really .
they served salad shortly my goodness this place was slow though .
when it came out , it was pretty lousy .
i 'd stay away from this garden like the plague , though .
i feel like the food is not flavorful and are always missing something .
this place was disgusting !
the food was gross , greasy and very bad .
i gave it one star because of the waiter .
smells like wet dog .
service was very bad today .
delivered our desert in a to go container without us even asking !
the service however , left much to be desired .
our server was obviously having a bad night .
it took almost _num_ minutes to get our salad .
at that point our drinks were empty .
poor service .
service is very bad .
waitress was throwing plates on the table .
have been to many restaurants but this was my worst experience .
wow , only in charlotte would you find a chain restaurant bar crawl .
it 's og though , so neither were anything spectacular .
it saved me from cooking and doing dishes though .
we wo n't be stopping back to celebrate at this location again .
food came slow and was cold .
but the reason i went was to try the lobster raviolis .
there i was very disappointed .
shrimp on top was nice but no lobster filling .
i just remembered why i do n't visit chain sit down restaurants .
i 'm glad there was more mango than strawberry .
the strawberry was too sweet .
by far the worst service we 've had in a while .
i am a big fan of olive garden but not this one .
a refill was never offered .
the salad was swimming in dressing where normally the dressing is light .
it was totally different from all other og restaurants i 've visited .
i doubt that i 'll ever go back to this location again .
no one was at the door to greet me .
i had to walk around the whole restaurant to find my husband .
what a terrible manager !
i see the server standing right there with no response .
slow service and a mediocre meal .
for example , at my most recent visit i ordered the steak gorgonzola alfredo .
the steak was supposed to be medium ; instead it came well done .
( that might also explain the meat being overdone ) .
very disappointing .
i do n't like chains a lot , but some i tolerate .
it 's noisy , crowded , disorganized , and there are not enough waiters .
so far really slow food service .
okay , but wo n't be going back soon .
saturday was my first time back and i was dissapointed in the changes .
otherwise i would have brought him with me and we could have dined in !
really made me sad .
its not like she got nothing out of it !
the fries were bad .
not crispy but chewy and not very salty .
does n't seem like good customer service .
never again will i deal with these useless morons .
first mistake .
_num_ .
this was a no go for me .
i went and told carmax and they said ford was lying .
_num_ hour later it was completed .
they tried to charge me $ _num_ for _num_ hours of labor .
they then corrected it and charged me a flat fee of $ _num_ .
if this is their generic price for _num_ hour of labor it is ridiculous .
it should n't have take an hour to do it anyway .
the owner called me to apologize .
i probably wo n't be back .
i only stopped because i needed ta repair that day and they were close .
it is my pet peeve .
it is wrong .
i needed a patch so i could go on about my day .
the young man who greeted me seemed a little turned off by my coupon .
i thanked the jerk for his time and drove off .
he tried to `` screw '' me over .
bad move buddy .
are you freaking kidding me ?
i have never dealt with such poor management in my life .
i am brand new to the area and never ordered from this location before .
who knows , maybe i was going to order a pizza anyway !
the pizza was cut all messed up as well .
simply put , horrible experience .
send it my way , i 'll get you payment .
that same day i called another company and booked them with no issues .
i made a reservation on monday to pick up some equipment on saturday .
they confirmed my reservation on the phone .
no big deal .
dew & when they brought it out , it was in a can .
so , obviously , no free refills .
gross .
i stuck them in my mouth and wow ... they were flavorless .
ridiculous .
really sad about this one .
we normally delivery at work 2-3 or _num_ times a week .
the pricing is ridiculous .
this is not ihop quality food .
_num_ % of the time , the eggs are not done anyway .
i was very uncomfortable .
drinks are not made properly and the draft beer was warm .
from everyone , including bartenders , which is strange to say the least .
we 've been there twice and witnessed one fight per night .
dogs also get some time to run in a huge play area outside .
)
however , be sure to ask for a tour and see the space .
when we called they said no payment , no dogs .
they would not give me the dogs and work out a payment plan .
they said they have no idea where the dogs are now .
very disappointed !
i would not leave my dogs there .
quickly losing stars .
not a fan .
the employees and jewelry itself saved this review from being a _num_ star .
too bad , jared 's .
printed out my receipt .
couple weeks later , no phone call .
she was having a hard time finding my order .
ummm no ?
not coming back anymore after i find another band to replace this band .
poor customer service when trying to use reward from app .
this is a review of their business practices online .
slow , absolutely the worst .
horrible communication skills and customer service .
i visited recently and i will not be returning , ever !
at 1:30 i asked about my vehicle and was told i was next .
at _num_ pm i asked for my car .
there was no apology given or really any concern about customer service .
left this store and went to jiffy lube down the street .
hate the place !
this midas location is grossly overpriced !
beautiful courtyard less than _num_ yards away .
but no way to cancel , need _num_ hours notice for us ... .
there 's a reason no one goes here .
service is horrible .
do n't bother to stop .
you have been warned .
worst arby 's in the planet .
there were only two orders ahead of me , utterly ridiculous .
when we walked in , it was like we were in the south pacific .
the thermostat must have been set at _num_ .
maybe that 's for atmosphere , but it was not enjoyable .
it 's bad .
really bad .
otherwise , it stinks .
let me first tell you that i 'm not really a sushi guy .
but this was nasty .
that 's not too bad , right ?
add that to the place , the staff , the price - go elsewhere .
you 'll have a much nicer experience .
ugh ... do n't waste your time or your money !
skip everything else !
some things cold , when they should be hot .
not clean , either .
_num_ per person not worth it .
went for dinner tonight and was disgusted .
tons of garbage and food under these carts .
then all the food was cold and hard .
no idea why a restaurant owner would keep their place in this way .
avoid this place .
the other food was decent , but as i said before was cold .
did not like it .
not the cleanest establishment .
_num_ dollars for two that i 'll never see again .
do n't think i 'll be back .
stealing from your customers is not a great idea china buffet .
avoid this place like the plague !
twenty mins to close but was told that the kitchen was closed .
not going for it .
dried food stuck on silverware , glasses , and plates .
the food on the buffet was cold and tasted old .
the odd food selections are maybe a cross between southern style and fake chinese .
was n't impressed .
because there regular food is mall grade at best .
i do not eat sushi , however my husband does .
they need to be cleaning this dirty restaurant .
it 's definitely not the worst i 've ever had .
very poor .
just not worth it .
poor job .
pleasant staff , but poor quality work .
they damaged my car .
absolutely horrible customer service and product being sold to the public .
highly recommend you find another car wash .
poor customer service !
i wish i had read their reviews prior to going .
the only interior cleaning was vacuum .
they sprayed the windows but obviously allowed them to air dry .
i have paid $ _num_ for a car was and received a better quality .
it 's clear auto only cares about quantity not quality .
i would not recommend this company to anyone ever .
i past here daily and will never patronize this establishment again .
i 've taken my car here at least twice .
both times it failed on a defective license bulb .
well this was our first attempt at this location and it was below expectations .
my guess is they were understaffed .
once we did get seated , service was slow and really bad .
not our best ihop experience .
unfortunately the steak tips and eggs that i ordered for dinner were foul .
without them i 'd have gone hungry that night .
i ordered the country sausage potatoes , pumpkin pancakes & grits .
cold grits are n't a treat .
it was n't the best meal as far as service was concerned .
apparently my empty glass was n't enough of a visual cue .
i 'm trying the chicken tortilla soup and the french onion pot roast .
the soup was steaming hot and its primary flavor was salt .
the pot roast by comparison had no flavor whatsoever .
their orange juice is never too tart , never too sweet .
the mashed potatoes had clearly been in that serving bowl since the morning .
the omelet was uninspired .
it had no flavor whatsoever .
the red velvet pancakes were chocolate pancakes with red food dye added into them .
then the stack was topped with whipped cream .
god took too long to come out and half our order was forgotten .
terrible service and terrible food !
food was bland and tasteless and she never bothered to fill our drinks .
never coming back again , it was such a waste of money !
slow kitchen right .
in summary the service is very questionable .
i could n't agree more .
the place smells of old towels and the bathrooms are horrible .
over-priced , slow , very dirty , and an overall sketchy vibe .
not really .
was n't impressed .
the only thing they did n't want to do was flush my brake fluid .
guess it was ok ?
otherwise it was _num_ miles .
i did n't understand why he was asking that or the reason .
he could n't explain why he was asking the question either .
that was a little awkward though .
they are not very through .
he said , `` just grab your registration and come on in . ''
it stayed there for about _num_ minutes before i was called to the counter .
i lost out because the requested work was n't done .
no frills .
no fuss .
typical fast chinese food .
their prices are cheap , and our food was just ok .
i mean , there was oil dripping out of the inside .
almost as if it had been taking a bath in grease .
could have been a fluke , but i am guessing msg ?
, but a couple places in charlotte made me like it again .
this is not one of them .
would n't recommend .
giving _num_ stars instead of _num_ just cause i 've had worse .
_num_ .
_num_ .
boneless ribs were n't typical .
not rib meat .
_num_ .
very dry .
_num_ .
but bags were covered in grease .
i had to wash my hands just from opening the bag .
_num_ .
rice was over cooked .
complete mush .
there is no lobby .
this rink just did n't blow my mind .
Positive
i also wish that they would have set up some cones inside the rink .
they serve beer and wine !
really need to put some money into this place .
entire place smells like wet dog .
they have an assortment of beer and wine .
when that was fixed , the lines did n't roll over properly .
two different people in my office were reduced to tears .
the said they would get back to me within _num_ hours .
there are many places less expensive or where you get more for your money .
i ask again , are they hot ?
she did n't massage anything .
i have n't felt this ripped off in a very long time .
i fianc gave me a gift card here for my birthday .
he did the total opposite .
for $ _num_ i expected so expected something a lot better .
needless to say i am extremely displeased with my services here .
the only part of our day that really irritated me was our checkout .
she clearly saw us walk up , and my mother go into the shop .
i continued to stand there , and finally she ( lindsey ) greeted me .
over crowded , loud , and not a relaxing experience .
stayed at the hotel and booked two massages .
sadly not worth the money or time .
i was planning to go again but not anymore .
services between spas are typically the same .
the locker room was ridiculously crowded ( too small ) .
this resort is most definitely not worth the ladies weekend .
it was over $ _num_ thrown in the trash .
i 've been a yelp user for years .
i come down at 9:00 and the shuttle had already left .
why take down my room number if you were n't going to call me ?
waited for the shuttle around _num_ min at the airport .
i got rid of it myself , though lol .
i would give this place a _num_ star if i could !
this is not the courtyard i was expecting .
common areas needed to be vacuumed !
but their repeated attempts to enter woke us up .
then staff tried to get in !
coffee pot in our room was broken .
_num_ stars might be too generous !
this place is awful .
the internet is so slow it is not functional for basic email .
this trip has no internet .
this place is disgusting .
my room was not clean .
the air did not function properly .
very disappointed .
they were gracious to direct us to signs that got us out of parking .
this place charges $ _num_ for _num_ minutes .
there was no attendant at the booth when we left .
luckily , we had two $ _num_ dollar bills and it worked .
bank of america credit cards are sticky with fees that you do n't deserve .
lo and behold , twenty minutes later , they called us back over .
it was clear servicing customers was an inconvenience to him .
customer friendly said there is nothing he can do .
when i complained how they failed to honor my reservation mr .
at this office any reservation you have is basically worthless .
nor has the manager ever returned my message .
i had two dogs , fries , and a coke for lunch .
frankly ( haha ) , it did n't do anything for me .
maybe the hot dog is cold , but the chili is hot .
i want to like this place , but just ca n't .
the chilli they use is worse than that mystery meat texas pete canned chilli .
?
if i could give less than one star , i would .
let 's start with having a _num_ sanitation rating .
ie skinny burgers with simple ingredients ( ie american cheese and ketchup ) .
it was quite mediocre for old school burgers and fries .
the chili was not very good either and the fries were pretty tasteless .
maybe i just ordered the wrong thing on the wrong day .
did n't see too much in particular that i loved about this place .
and once again , pretty nasty .
no thanks .
three strikes jackson 's , you wo n't see me again .
walking through the halls it becomes evident this is an old hotel .
the bathroom was awful , bedding lumpy and ancient , and the lighting poor .
will not be staying here again .
the place was so slow .
$ _num_ and we both left and ate pizza .
this was not a four star dining experience .
really disappointing .
no one wanted to complain as it was a customer event .
but i would have sent it back if i were on my own .
four star _num_ diamond yea right .
no creativity to the cooking .
at times we could barely hear ourselves think , let alone hear each other .
the steak was overcooked .
the cheesecake looked and tasted like it was a store bought frozen dessert .
turns out , that wine was not included and was a $ _num_ bottle .
most of our bill was the wine .
could have being very good but it was not .
i find it acceptable , but nothing special .
in fact , the menu is , to me , kinda boring .
the waitress was n't rude , but she just was n't there .
i guess for $ _num_ i could n't complain .
bad food .
bug problem .
also my veggies were n't seasoned at all and were not even steamed .
nothing special on this menu ... .
the food , on the other hand , is not good .
spicy crab soup did not have crab meant in it .
it was n't even spicy .
no , the waiter was quick to tell me i ordered medium rare .
by now , my companions had finished eating .
the meat was so tough , i gave up after a few pieces .
nothing to write home about .
do n't understand the hype .
not a good dinner place .
this showmars used to be awesome .
i would have given it _num_ stars .
this showmars is under new management and it sucks !
also , the portions are not as big .
change management and has gone down hill .
it 's slow , portions are smaller and the staff is terrible .
missed opportunity .
gone was the flavor and little taste of spicy burn at the end .
major disappointment !
i asked wth and they told me , management change .
that makes me so sad knowing i will never experience that wonderful flavor again .
good food , but poor service at this particular location .
a shame .
i 'll continue to frequent other locations , just not this particular one .
i 'm sorry but what is the big deal ?
and everything is ala carte !
no way .
i was not impressed by anything here .
but quality steaks can be eaten at much better priced establishments .
he apologized and asked me to come back as he was gone .
the bartender never came back to me to take my drink order .
as diners we would like prompt service and attention but this was not good .
highly disappointed !
the last two times i have been there were not good .
it appears that the oven was too hot .
my steak was not cooked to the right temperature - well vs medium well .
poor service and the food was overpriced for the quality .
nothing tasted bad but it was way too expensive .
i would recommend capital grille over morton 's .
an hour .
_num_ ) write down orders so you do n't forget .
we do n't care !
i wish i could leave a no star rating .
service was awful .
the bartenders had no desire to serve `` us '' .
worst steakhouse experience i have had to date !
we may have waited _num_ minutes before our table was ready .
at this point we still had not seen our server .
i poured my own wine refills .
we ate our dinner quickly because of how hungry we were .
very little apology from the staff about the horrible experience .
even at the discounted price we paid for queens feast we felt robbed .
_num_ of _num_ of our steaks came out totally wrong .
chili 's can cook a better steak than them .
ridiculous .
this last experience was by far the most disappointing .
_num_ sides came out late .
i ordered the bone in fillet , they brought me a ribeye .
so i had to eat my sides cold .
the flavor is ok but why is the dog so skinny ?
they made it anyway and gave it to me .
there is no excuse .
they did not have many items .
do they not make fresh brew coffee .
maybe this starbucks just want to sell all the coffee they made this morning .
starbucks is not the right one for me .
not like you starbucks !
cool sports bar , pool tables and ample flat screens .
but this was pretty bad .
ok , mistake .
it just is n't up my alley though .
also the bathrooms where in bad shape .
i really hate this place .
i 've given it _num_ chances , and they all sucked .
food was awful .
staff was overwhelmed , they tried , but to no avail .
Negative
this is the first , and probably only , negative review i have posted .
simply a bad experience .
the food took way too long as well and was only lukewarm .
i refuse to ever set foot in this sub-par establishment again .
pretty obvious the waitress did n't know the table numbers .
at the same time she got sat another table of _num_ women .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the beer specials and _num_ .
seems he was already looking to replace the manager .
we walked in and it was awkward .
no waitress no one else walking around .
we counted _num_ parties , thats it ... in a otherwise bare restaurant .
our drinks were refilled often without being asked .
will not be back .
we just received the worst service ever i will never come back .
service was very slow ass and the management was not customer friendly .
it was awful we could n't find any positive in it .
it was _num_ of us and _num_ ppl got their checks .
to further add to the drama , the parking garage has virtually no signage !
a shame , really , for my once favorite bar in charlotte .
went in to meet some friends who 'd come in from out of town .
the music was too loud for conversation .
summary : very noisy , terrible service .
wild dogs could n't drag me back .
i stood there for approx 5-7 mins before i was even acknowledged .
my braised short ribs were all bones !
i sent their management a message , but have not yet heard back .
been here twice ; both times it was an awful experience .
we will not be going back .
apparently , reservations are not valued here .
he needs to be fired and needs to be some changes made .
did n't get our food until after _num_ .
food is n't good either .
greasy and the batter was peeling off .
i did n't get what i ordered .
i over cooked greasy fries like everyone else .
it had shoe string onion rings and slaw on it .
stopped in after the theater for a pint , but could not get served .
so , we again waited & never did see a server .
there was absolutely no seasoning on them and they had zero taste .
even adding salt and pepper did not help it .
i called the manager over , to let them know the situation .
easily takes _num_ min to get a drink .
for $ _num_ i 'd expect a lot more .
the rose sauce was n't as flavorful as i would expect .
that is a lot for a less than adequate sandwhich .
i will not be coming back .
just average unfortunately .
the mediocre : everything else .
the really really low point of the meal was the desert .
the bread pudding was ice cold and hard as a rock .
and questioned why it was cold .
bread pudding is always warm no ?
lobster and potato cakes could have been better - too salty imo .
even the door man commented on how rude the bartenders were .
never going back .
the menu is n't extensive , so keep in mind your options are limited .
and , all were nothing to write home about .
not worth it .
know your customers , bring back the stew .
hostess was extremely unprofessional and rude !
no one was uptown and the place was completely empty .
worst lunch option uptown .
i will not be returning .
my lunch companion had roast beef and regretted ordering anything .
server was very slow and was n't attentive .
bouncer was extremely rude .
we had a reservation for _num_ for a casual business dinner .
it took _num_ minutes to get our server to take our dinner order .
it was very difficult to get our server 's attention throughout the evening .
the food came quick but no potato soup .
the service itself was n't to great either .
the wait staff was not that great either !
the bartenders attitude were like `` we r annoyed cause we r there '' .
we walked in and waited to be sat .
no one came or even looked at us .
the bartender looked at us walked away .
after _num_ minutes he never returned .
when i come back to charlotte i wo n't be trying this restaurant again .
i had carryout .
very quick but kinda confusing to find the place .
so far i have not found a good chinese food place here in charlotte .
i would not recommend the spring rolls they are kinda bland .
still looking for a good chinese food place here in charlotte wish me luck !
sad to say , my entree was a little bland .
it was a tofu , vegetables , and wide rice noodles entree .
food is decent , but service is no good .
unfortunately , went in for lunch today and had a similar experience with service .
will be busy during peak lunch hours from 11:30 to 1:30 pm .
they are rude .
literally rude .
half the time you do n't understand what they speak in english .
no in this restaurant are polite .
unfortunately , the food was sub-par .
i ordered honey walnut chicken and was served honey walnut shrimp .
i got the steamed chicken dumplings and a order of edamame to go .
the worst part were the soy beans .
when i got the food it was cold and i was so disappointed .
otherwise , i do n't think i 'll order from there again .
if so , then you 'll want to take a pass on this place .
the food by best is subpar and barely mediocre .
the lady at the front desk is absolutely rude rude rude rude .
disgusting phone etiquette and completely appalling .
so sad .
used to be so much better .
no flavor .
everything we ordered was very very bland .
very disappointed in my charlotte chinese .
wo n't be back .
i ca n't imagine how this place has _num_ stars .
fried dumplings were thick and mushy .
the ramen soup was bland .
egg roll was sour of all things .
hot and sour soup also bland .
very bland .
very very bland .
not much pineapple in the chicken pineapple dish .
nor is there any hint of a true thai taste .
i also ordered the curry chicken noodle bowl .
again , very bland .
not much of a coconut taste either .
the _num_ starts are just because the broccoli looks fresh .
not sure if i 'll try again .
instead , it was dry and tasteless i know filling .
waste of a cheat meal .
worst chinese food i 've had in a while .
have you ever been to a sports bar where there is no games on ?
this seemed quite bizarre .
also , why have _num_ screens when you can have one huge one ?
why give french fries with most of them burned ?
food is terrible .
everybody has bad days , they should not be this bad ... .
the chicken wings tasted like fake butter and rubber .
it 's my fault , i guess .
the kids menu was quite pathetic and expensive !
$ _num_ for two small hamburgers ?
i had the thai beef salad and it had about _num_ strips of beef .
flavor was ok but the lack of real substance was overbearing to anything else .
aside from just being terrible , she was also unfriendly .
as a vegetarian , it was entirely another matter for me .
what was delivered was a basket of chips and cheese dip .
i only gave them _num_ star because _num_ was n't an option .
horrible experience .
the bread was cold and hard .
we had to go , it was getting way too late .
went here a night during final four ( basket ball ) .
the bar was not to noisy and the server was very attentive .
tried their philly cheese steak .
sorry guys you really need to repair the beer machine and hire a cook .
as for a place to spend money uptown i 'd skip it .
the bar is ok , the food is ok , it 's nothing special .
i will never go back to this place , to many other options uptown .
when my food came out , the chicken was cold .
the only thing i liked was their ranch sauce .
it was kind of uncomfortable .
no management present that we could see .
so , why only _num_ stars you ask ?
it 's horrible .
i would n't be as concerned if i were here for pleasure .
so , you get where this is going , right ?
walking into the hotel , it smelled stale .
room three does n't smell much better .
again , stale and moldy .
i like the quiche every morning rotating variety everyday .
but my room is outdated and smells like there has been a massive leak .
not a good sign .
this place is not worth the price !
only _num_ stars for location .
worst hotel i have yet to stay in as a consultant .
wow , i was wrong .
we decided to try room service ... what a mistake .
i talked to the duty manager and he was no help at all .
i found all of this very unacceptable .
it reflects poorly on the entire hotel .
two of my colleagues also have lost stuff in this hotel .
but i strongly believe that the staff in their housekeeping department are not honest .
the room i stayed in was old and run down .
the biggest problem i had though was the paper thin walls .
water pressure in the shower was also horrible .
my biggest complaint though is the housekeeping staff .
loud , loud , loud !
this was my second time staying at this hotel with the same problem .
the `` new '' rooms are terrible .
for a downtown attempt at luxury this is bad .
terrible for business travel .
no desk , no real work surface but an oversized tv tray .
no desk type chair .
which the bench under the tv is an absolutely terrible idea !
just a poor design all around .
rooms are poorly designed .
faux wood floor makes everything echo .
in fact faux wood furniture all around .
while they are remodeling this is no longer a business class hotel .
why in _num_ are hotels still doing this ?
the room are _num_ stars .
when we got back to our hotel .
_num_ caesar salad with flank steak and another caesar salad with shrimps !
both salad looked like they been sitting out for awhile .
stomach hurts all night .
oh well , their loss .
i was seated and served a complimentary salad .
i expressed my disappointment and said please do what you need to do .
terrible customer service !
menu says `` soup '' , no particular type .
waitress said i could double rice , but no soup change .
the place was empty when we got there and when we left .
... no wonder .
one star because zero was n't an option .
oh and the sushi was not fresh and tasted gross .
nigiri sushi was not good at all and neither were the rolls .
they just said thank you and walked away .
we ordered hibachi steak chicken and shrimp with fried rice and vegetables .
was not impressed at all .
did not taste like hibachi at all .
sushi might be good , but i do n't eat sushi .
i just had such a bad experience here .
the employees were extremely rude , the food is overpriced and mediocre .
do n't even get me started .
but the service is horrible .
if i was n't vegan , i 'd eat the dish .
i got uncomfortable with the waitress so i told another waitress about my situation .
do n't think i 'll be coming back .
i used their online service to pick up my laundry .
for three days no one called or picked up the clothes .
i would certainly not recommend this dry cleaners to anyone .
an expensive hassle for such terrible service .
what a mistake it was .
but they are n't reliable .
he truly comes across as if he could care less , and it shows .
breaking off buttons then charging to put back on .
they do n't care about your clothes .
pay more elsewhere for better quality .
i ordered the seabass and it really was n't anything spectacular .
i visited charlotte and decided to go here , cause it was crowded .
there was nothing really special about the food .
i 'd have to say it was no where near an awesome experience .
needless to say none of us wanted to order another round of drinks .
could n't you have just lied to me and told me you were out ?
dont get me wrong , i kinda like applebees .
just dont expect anything amazing .
that might make it a little better .
their menu is way overpriced , with nothing really great on it .
the beer was decent , it 's just draft beer here .
but i do n't think i 'll be going back anytime soon .
ate here on a saturday night for a friend 's birthday .
our server , from beginning to end , was slow .
would have rather spent $ _num_ elsewhere .
also they were not that tender .
my wife had the chicken pesto pasta .
while that was decent , it was n't exciting either .
i mean , we went here thinking we would get a good value .
unfortunately , it 's more than a lot of other comparable places in uptown .
too many other choices in charlotte to come back here .
i have mixed feelings about rock bottom .
unfortunately that burger was `` _num_ 'd '' ... as was her second choice .
i will not be going back .
the food was bad , yo .
like , below applebee 's bad .
i also ordered the southwestern turkey burger .
i was n't impressed with this place .
the beer is awesome i will admit and the servers are pretty attentive .
i ate a little bit , but i did n't want to finish it .
way too much pepper or spices , and i could hardly taste the cheese .
we walked out and still nobody noticed .
this used to be my favorite place uptown .
really disappointed .
really , are they kidding serving store bought salsa ?
the chicken sandwich was burnt and you cook smell the burn !
not sure we would return anytime soon .
bad service and mediocre food served cold .
the kicker is that this was n't the first time this has happened .
Negative
if i could give negative star rating i would .
it was not especially crowded ( no wait ) and we had reservations .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
chicken fried chicken for three of us and my wife had the sizzling peppers .
more pear shaped , waitress was no where to be found for _num_ minutes .
the rating is not for the appetizer , like i said things happen .
i took my young son with me so it was just dinner no alcohol .
we did n't see him again until after our food was brought to us .
the beer was pretty good , but the food was a real disappointment .
i had the pizza and it was mediocre at best .
the wings were fine , but nothing special .
the restaurant was busy , but was n't packed .
overall they get a d for food and an a for ambience and location .
then no , i have not gotten my beer .
she again left for another _num_ minutes .
was someone else supposed to bring it , did she forget ?
the chicken was supposed to be grilled .
fries with burger were luke warm .
as late as it was , there was no offer to comp the pizza .
but obviously we have no plans to go back .
ick !
half the time our drinks were empty .
so what was the point in an app ?
there were tiny pieces of what looked like artificial crab .
no lobster .
caesar salad should not be too spicy to eat .
i 'd give it zero stars but yelp wo n't let me .
i have eaten here several times & always find it disappointing .
tried a variety of foods & none have been particularly good .
there are no free meals in america andrea !
i would n't even give this place a star for this reason !
we had the worst experience at this place !
it ruined our first visit in charlotte .
their service was horrible and i would never go to any rock bottom !
establishment was not busy at all , decided to seat ourselves at the bar .
this place just does not seem serious about business standards and drinks were weak .
fianc ordered bison burger and ended up getting a 2am with egg , etc .
apparently it 's supposed to be `` loaded '' with roasted chicken .
bun was also cold like just out of the refrigerator .
unacceptable .
i thought it was odd how many empty tables were in the bar area .
i 'd give only _num_ star , but previous visits were acceptable .
not edible .
came in for a quick bite to eat on a sunday for lunch .
the chicken was flavorless and tough .
the fries were cold and mushy .
will not come back here .
the service was very slow and obviously not very interested in being there .
the food was also disappointing .
the chicken breast was so small .
worse was that there was no flavor .
it was just all around bland .
would recommend not sitting outside or at the bar if you want food .
stopped in before the panthers sunday night game .
gross .
bartenders were terrible and not attentive .
waited _num_ minutes before someone asked if we needed something .
unacceptable .
do the bartenders here not work on tips ?
only plus is the beer was $ _num_ and they validate parking .
nobody tried to even convince us to stay .
2nd time service was extremely slow .
nothing that really stands out .
the beginning check in should 've been a red flag for us to run .
_num_ minutes later we were sat .
some drinks were returned from the bar while some never reached the table .
neither of us touched our food .
another couple ordered the cajun pasta and brewery beef tips .
no checks .
we paid for drinks and left our sever a gracious tip .
finally i flagged down a waiter and asked to see the manager .
well , the customer service did n't get much better .
i said it was ok and that i would rather have a mixed drink .
i was starving so at this point i just made do .
when it came down to orders and service though , sadly was disappointed .
the veggies were overly salty table round .
and meats were not cooked to request and the servers forgot the eating utensils .
after _num_ more min .
i was n't particularly hungry and ordered the mexican street tacos .
the broccoli was terrible .
the beer was good , service was ok , but the food was terrible .
i ordered lobster & shrimp `` enchiladas '' , which had practically no filling .
in short , our experience here was awful .
the burgers were just okay .
not particularly flavorful but edible .
the sticks were not actually pretzels .
the did n't look or taste like pretzels , rather like breadsticks .
the cheesy jalapeno dip it was served with was good .
the chicken tacos were good .
i personally ordered the lobster and shrimp tacos and they were served cold .
they were served with a side of bland , instant rice and black beans .
Negative
the biggest negative about rock bottom is by far the service .
the service was awful .
it then took quite awhile for our dinners to start arriving .
and then _num_ minutes later , a fifth entree was brought out .
it was not a gluten free menu at all !
very disappointed with this restaurant .
this place was horrible !
do n't get married here .
that was $ _num_ down the drain .
this place is beautiful but not worth the money , stress , or headache .
fish was not fresh .
the manager claims he is very helpful ?
he is not !
this fast food place almost always gets my order wrong .
they charge me for things that they do n't have .
besides the staff being extremely unprofessional , the wait time is always long .
the cashier was very polite , inviting , and helpful .
seems like they used imitation cheese , because it certainly didnt melt .
do n't waste your time ... .
this is not a really cool hang out .
the bar is really small and the staff was really unfriendly .
the place just seemed small and shabby to me .
the restaurant was pretty empty , no wait for a table .
we started off with two appetizers : calamari and crab dip .
we just ignored this and ate the calamari , as is .
the crab dip was another disappointment .
the cheese was loaded on the top with almost no crab flavor .
wow , this was just embarrassing ( for them ) .
i had about _num_ bites and just put it aside .
the food was decent but _num_ issues , _num_ major one .
first - the water at this establishment is disgusting .
it was very , very bad .
very bad .
so very bad that i 'm writing my first yelp review .
i will tell people not to go there and i will never go back .
[ the bad . ]
the temperature in the restaurant was hot .
_num_ outside , _num_ inside .
which is just weird in a restaurant setting .
he said , `` we only have _num_ .
we usually have _num_ but we ran out of _num_ today . ''
my order was wrong .
i sucked it up and ate the stupid beef .
the beef was very pink in the middle and was of extremely poor quality .
[ the not so bad . ]
like i said maybe just an off night but we wo n't be back .
so , let 's make that a _num_ stars .
restaurant dot com you 've let me down once again .
i 've got to ask myself why do i keep doing this .
no excuse for an overcooked steak ever , and all ordered medium rare .
avoid this place even if free .
very poor service .
the chicken tasted suspect and the rice was mushy .
seafood noodle soup had slices of pork .
the cilantro garnish was n't even chopped .
the potatoes were like tater tots .
no ketchup ?
it wasnt horrible , it just wasnt great .
this could be an awesome place to stay .
i was given a sofa bed to sleep on .
i had made the reservation several weeks prior , with guaranteed late arrival .
i get to the room and the electronic key does not work .
his key does not work either .
later they apologize for the error .
the bar area has maybe half a dozen customers at the time .
a gym attendant wants you to sign in but has no pen .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
they also tend to forget some essential ( i.e .
i absolutely hate this place .
btw , no one ever showed up to fix the air .
this is the first time i feel compelled to write a bad review .
the hotel rooms were dirty and service was terrible .
it was not my pillow .
( but they have still not done this _num_ weeks later ) .
i can only say that this hotel has zero commitment to customer service .
the beds were uncomfortable .
_num_ coke = $ _num_ .
i will never be back .
do not stay here if you have a choice .
to add insult to injury , the only restaurant in the hotel sucks .
no concierge .
the hilton would probably have been better or perhaps any of the other hotels .
do n't waste your time staying here if you are a business traveler .
i stayed three nights at the westin with a group for a conference .
two cups of coffee per room per day , extras can be purchased .
so why the low rating ?
here 's the bad points .
wouldnt you think they would have an attendant check on the bathroom on occasion .
big disappointment ... try the hilton .
but its definitely not worth the money .
the fitness center lacks a fan , so working out gets too hot .
i feel like i should only be spending maybe $ _num_ .
otherwise , i will never stay at this place .
there are much better choices in uptown charlotte !
now the bad ... stains .
there is no other way to describe everything in my room .
they just need a better starting product !
i did not find the venue pleasant .
it was then i noticed small mold spots in the shower .
the ac in the room also did not seem to operate properly .
no way it got near _num_ or i would have been freezing .
got _num_ bites for one night .
he also suggested me to go to er if not getting better .
obviously management is not training well for customer service at this location .
conference rooms were poorly set-up , freezing cold , and loud !
avoid the valet at all costs !
description said grain mustard cole slaw and pickles .
the coleslaw was a couple pieces of lettuce with some carrots .
either the batteries are almost dead or its just terrible .
at _num_ am and two phone calls , still no coffee .
no apologies .
big box , impersonal hotel .
the views are not worth it .
time to check out and never come back .
staff was supposed to help with a reservation and dropped the ball .
the hotel is starting to look warn and needs investment .
total time spent _num_ hour for a $ _num_ drink .
no ... not a sir and i wanted to order mozzarella wheels .
`` oh ok that 'll be $ _num_ . ''
i pretty much hate this hotel .
this hotel is a complete ripoff !
other than that , customer service is awful .
the restaurant is the worst .
and they got my order wrong .
how the heck do you get that order wrong ?
we were disappointed in this hotel .
lobby bar staff was unfriendly .
we stayed for four nights and got minimal cleaning service in our room .
the phone call from the manager @ 7:00 am ruined the trip for me .
i did n't appreciate it , understand it , or like it at all .
this is the worst westin i 've ever stayed in .
i even asked my husband to check in case i missed it .
i waited about _num_ mins and still no menu .
we check in , we get the wrong room .
their televisions could be called outdated ... at best .
they tried to fix the broken telephone but were n't really successful .
i stayed here for a week .
i dunno .
both experiences have been terrible .
it was fixed promptly , but made a bad first impression .
quite possibly the most miserable hotel experience of my life .
noisy , dirty , poorly renovated and the worst customer service known to man .
does n't even deserve one star in my book .
avoid at all costs !
the rooms were clean but i would not stay here again .
it 's awful and we wo n't be going back .
the worst of our experience ?
if anyone 's had theft problems , this may be why .
there are many choices in charlotte - do not consider this hotel as one .
under renovations until december _num_ , _num_ .
the staff was friendly every time we walked past the front desk .
the restaurant across the street was apparently a night club as well .
we tried to nap but simply could n't .
more screaming and yelling than the night before .
it literally sounds like there is a major concert going on .
the staff called the cops who are apparently there but not doing anything .
i stayed at this motel for _num_ nights ( june 19th & 20th ) .
i called & talked to manger as soon as i saw the bites .
when we checked out i spoke to manager & showed her my bites .
i 'm still waiting to find out what ate me up !
no way would i ever stay at this motel again .
beware veterans , they do not acknowledge war .
no more .
veterans beware !
do not stay st this hotel .
do n't expect too much .
the room doors are all spring loaded to they slam shut .
not a quiet hotel at anytime of the day .
we went on a friday and it was n't too busy .
and they did n't seem too concerned about my complaint .
and the bathrooms were nasty .
bottom line is poor excuses for terrible work .
sorry for the comment .
i signed up as they knocked at my door .
i was a customer for approx _num_ yrs .
only because they were my only option .
time warner cable is awful .
also , they really have the worst customer service i have ever dealt with .
its also extremely odd that they could not contact me via e-mail or telephone ?
would that have been so difficult ?
well money talks so they talked me into giving them another try .
horrible !
worst service ever !
i get it .
however , the sucker that i am for a deal , i got it .
shame on you , time warner cable .
some of the worst service ever .
i then recieved the bill the next month and the price had no change .
ok , no big deal .
she talked to the computer screen instead of to my face .
talk about unpleasant .
terrible customer service .
called back and was told wait time would be _num_ minutes .
i read somewhere that charlotte has the highest time warner rates in the country .
avoid this company if you can .
once they have you they make it hard to escape .
do n't even get me started with their customer service , or lack of .
when i finally get someone on the phone , they are rarely helpful .
possible the most frustrating company i have ever interacted with .
since they apparently hire good people , hire more !
the folks on the phone are incredibly rude .
absolute _num_ % avoid at all costs .
there is no email and i have spent hours on the phone .
i do not like this company !
inconsistent billing , poor customer service , and lies sum up this service .
ca n't wait for more service providers .
are you kidding me time warner ?
let 's add up those dollars , shall we , time warner ?
i also wish that i could provide them with zero stars .
this company is the worst to deal with .
after about _num_ minutes she realized she was entering it incorrectly .
therefore they installer never made it to my apartment .
but i placed the order online , then i am on hold again .
i 'm done i throw in the towel trying to deal with them .
why did n't i go with them first ?
should n't be too hard of a task , yeah ?
wrong .
how can i help you today ? ''
( _num_ minutes of this ) .
`` ok , sir .
( _num_ minutes on hold ) ... ... ... ... ... ... still transferred .
`` hello , sir .
the story does n't end there .
bad idea .
horrible service !
i vote time warner cable the worst company of all times .
do n't get me wrong there are other bad and good companies .
after that i would say sprint is the 5th worst .
so , i get online again , and guess what ?
worst customer service of any business i 've ever dealt with .
i am not holding my breath here .
i wish there were zero stars .
horrible , horrible company .
took me over an hour on the call but nothing had been done .
worst service ever !
the drop off process for returning your cable box is ridiculous .
worse customer service ever .
before i talked to them , i could change channels and had a picture .
the worst place on earth .
what a joke of a company .
i did not have internet for about a month .
so one month _num_ tech support calls later i got this information .
time warner cable is the worst !
stay away from them like the plague if possible .
the first winter storm and the cable and internet is out .
no way to find out what is going on .
stay away from time warner .
time warner cable has the absolute worst customer service i have ever come across .
if i could leave a lower rating , i would .
absolute thieves and liars .
i feel like i 'm in line for a bad carnival ride !
this is absolutely the worst place i 've ever been to .
do you ever leave a place and feel exhausted ?
this is the worst line i have ever seen in my life .
well they delayed the change for _num_ weeks so they could collect more longer .
the whole call took _num_ minutes most of it on hold .
poor customer service .
i would gladly give less than one star , alas , not possible !
not to mention the constant slow internet .
you 'll never get out unless you die .
terrible customer service .
ca n't wait to cancel service .
just know that they have horrible customer service and technicians .
no one ever knows what they are talking about and problems are never resolved .
if you can help it , do n't get cable from this cable company .
worst customer service and business model i have ever seen .
literally , anywhere .
we 've been going through the same problems for years now .
to any new potential new customer out there , please be warned .
just do n't do it !
i have never been so disappointed with a company .
i have to wait _num_ days to have service restored .
i can not recommend this company .
first , let me say i wish you could leave _num_ stars .
its crime and misleading to even give time warner _num_ star !
i do n't even see how time warner is even in business !
the sad part is that its not even the technicians fault .
_num_ up ?
another appointment was setup , and yet again no call and no show .
worst company ever .
ca n't wait till google comes to save us .
worst run business in the free world .
wanting faster internet i signed up .
they are out dated and their customer `` service '' is non existent .
they do n't care about anyone .
the worst everything .
worst ever at everything they do .
Very negative
if i could give negative stars i would .
eventually they brought me something but they were just sooo rude .
will never go back to that place again .
the person that seated us was curt and unfriendly .
the dishes that night were sub-par , which was a first .
i honestly have no clue !
only good thing about this place was my company .
finally this place was stale like the bread !
could n't have happened to a more deserving group of people .
found out he left less than a month after this incident .
plus , cold rude staff .
my trim & partial high lights took _num_ 1/2 hours though !
so i would say , sure - check them out .
just be sure to make your appointment with someone with experience .
$ _num_ pedicure should have been way better than it was .
skip it and try somewhere else for a spa pedicure .
safe to say , i was really upset and disappointed when i left .
first , they charge for beer and wine .
this results in my paying $ _num_ i should n't have had to pay .
too big , almost .
so many fountains , open areas , gardens to visit .
look , stop being cheap .
lame .
this place is horrible .
they lead me to each exit , and each time they were locked .
not so much at uptown charlotte .
the door not only did n't close , it did n't fit the frame .
but for a few seconds , water completely stops .
terrible front desk staff & way over priced .
the front desk staff was not interested in helping me checkin .
she kept answering the phone even though others were there .
made a one night stay $ _num_ .
i can send it to marriott if requested . )
coffee makers were loudly talking , and seemed annoyed at my presence .
wo n't be returning .
worst experience of my life .
tried to buy a book and have it shipped as a christmas present .
my simple question was : do you price match to you own website ?
his immediate reaction was rolling his eyes and said no we do n't !
i do n't want anyone else to go through this .
this review is for alterations only .
not measured correctly - very angry !
gross .
maybe i chose poorly but i was n't impressed at all .
smoked salmon plus creamy sauce , yum .
the underwhelming : the french onion soup was not hot .
maybe , to try the breakfast everyone seems to enjoy so much .
but probably not for dinner .
`` every christmas story ever told '' was slow and not that funny .
the first half dragged .
worse than cans .
is it worth the $ _num_ cover on fridays ?
not really .
i thought it was a bit too much .
this really is n't somewhere i want to be .
i 'm _num_ and i almost felt too old there .
but maybe that says more about me than it does bar charlotte .
for that reason , i ca n't give this place less than two stars .
$ _num_ for anything !
i just came from there .
i grabbed my daughter by the arm and led her out of there .
it is not safe for kids !
they changed it without notice , i 'm a little bitter .
it 's _num_ or _num_ bucks now after _num_ .
it 's not worth it .
i did n't touch anyone .
worst bar ever .
never going back .
i ordered smoked pork chops , home fries and green beans .
it was a total disappointment for me .
i was embarrassed for recommending this restaurant .
the fried chicken was straight forward .
it was a tad weird .
the collards were authentic and would get them again .
overall rating - just an ok .
however the experience here was not very good !
i was unable to comfortably eat for approx .
_num_ to _num_ minutes .
i ordered fried chicken , greens , yams , catfish , and banana pudding .
_num_ ) the fried chicken was n't really fried .
it looked like baked chicken that was dried out .
not crispy looking , not seasoned .
not very tasty .
_num_ ) the catfish was a complete fish with bones .
_num_ ) banana pudding was very good !
_num_ ) red beans rice and sausage was not good .
to many restaurants want my patronage .
however , it all went down hill from there .
finally , we just said thanks , but no thanks and left .
the only fast service was for the drinks and cornbread .
the food was alright and i thought that the portions were a good size .
but i think that the service was absolutely terrible .
i will not eat there again .
i rarely give bad reviews , but this was a pretty horrible food experience .
huge disappointment .
the fried chicken was pretty bland .
it seemed like it was pre-made and left out for too long .
the collard greens were insanely salty .
instant high blood pressure for sale !
: ( i ordered the salmon cakes which were really hard .
fried chicken , macaroni and cheese and collards .
the chicken was tasteless and the mac was bland .
the service was n't great either .
not impressed .
i went a second time just in case they were having a bad day .
the catfish was fried too hard and did not have any meat on it .
the okra and tomatoes were alright .
the service here sucks .
never going to go back again .
horrible !
not really impressed .
however , she did n't bother , probably because we were n't her table .
overall experience could have been better , but at least we tried it .
even the home fries where spicy .
i needed usually needed to wait and attempt to attract her attention .
the economy is not doing well.
with that said ... mert 's was disappointing and overpriced .
the mac n cheese and pound cake was ok at best .
the greens and yams were ok .
horrible !
i would not recommend this place and would never go back .
i ca n't believe people like this food .
to tell the truth , the service ran along the lines of pretty poor .
she never refilled our drinks either .
the fried green tomatoes had a very heavy batter on them .
it was hard to find `` tomatoes '' in the dish .
waitresses was pushing hard on the chicken tenders that she loved .
surprisingly , none of it was really that good .
service was cheerful though .
my biggest problem was the service .
she was surly and very uninterested in doing her job .
honestly some of the worst service i 've ever received anywhere .
my husband and i are pretty patient people , but this was ridiculous .
fried chicken , chicken tenders , and salmon cakes were also okay .
try a waffle house and i think you 'll have a better dining experience .
servers had awesome personalities and were very hospitable .
however , the food ... .
sucked .
the collards were not cook well and my salmon patties were burnt .
this was not good soul food at all .
i liked the atmosphere but the food was way too salty .
just did n't care for it .
the yams were out of a can so that was a major let down .
seems like a tourist spot to me .
the food left a lot to be desired .
reputation aside the salmon cakes had no seasoning and the ribeye was tough .
really disappointing .
this smell will stick to you for four to five hours at least .
the corn bread was the only good thing in the restaurant .
i ordered chicken wings which was cold and `` rubbery '' .
the service on the other hand was not .
i was confused asked to speak tho the manager by another waitress .
that waitress says sure she 's the lady over there in the red shirt .
so needless to say we will not be returning back to this establishment ever !
the collard greens had an excessive amount of uncooked onions and tomatoes .
my kids would not even eat them .
not so !
all said , we spent $ _num_ for soul food !
this place is not worth the price .
what a disappointment !
but the real let down was my shrimp and grits .
no seasoning .
no flavor .
my husband and i went to mert 's on sunday morning around _num_ .
not one said i will be your server i will be with you shortly .
not one said would you like some water .
not one said let me find who your server is .
this went one for _num_ minutes before we decided to get up and leave !
the service is terrible !
ultimately , there was confusion about who was responsible for our table .
she indicated that a long wait to be acknowledged is not common practice .
she invited me back to the restaurant .
but it was cheap and the corn bread was excellent .
every order was lacking just that little something that would make a meal enjoyable .
the worst customer service by server and manager .
tonight 's experience is one of the worst restaurant experiences i 've ever had .
supposedly there was a computer error with our food .
however while waiting two hours , we repeatedly asked our server about our dinner .
consider actually checking on the food .
all the tables around us came , ate and left .
she did not even follow through on that promise .
pathetic .
over _num_ % of the restaurant was filled with people from our convention .
the server never apologized .
nor did he bother to even clear our plates .
finally i had enough and walked out .
horrible customer service !
( not the waitress ) .
she was sarcastic & unprofessional .
the waitress could have cared less that we had to wait .
horrible service !
came back _num_ minutes later with lame lie .
another _num_ minutes later still no food , not even apps .
hostess also provided _num_ new lame lies .
dishonest staff ruined it for me .
chicken was dry , green beans under seasoned and bland .
the macaroni was good , they used cream cheese or something that tasted okay .
they got two orders wrong in our party of _num_ though .
over three hour wait for mediocre food and poor service .
one food runner , female , came to our table with the wrong food .
let 's just say everyone has something bad to say about their entree meal .
service was extremely slow .
it was cold and soggy .
the mac and cheese was good but again , it 's mac and cheese .
would n't go back .
the worst restaurant ever !
the service is the worst !
lazy and slow as ever !
do n't know what that meant ; did they run out of spinach ?
we ended up with two other omelettes , the garden and the shrimp creole .
however , we were highly disappointed by the food .
not the best soul good i 've ever eaten .
the fried chicken was standard not anything to rave about .
mac n cheese can pass for soul food .
corn bread mediocre , overall it was okay .
big fail on that expectation .
Negative
we did n't know if her reaction would be positive or negative .
after paying my bill i waited for my change that never came .
the waitresses have bad attitudes and rush you when ordering .
this was by far the worst soul food experience .
second time may be a charm but the first time was a complete failure .
the yams were hard as if they were freshly cut and simply plated .
tiger wood drinks were very tasty .
our server was not at all attentive to our needs .
the initial one that i received had obviously been sitting out too long .
it was cold .
overall , the experience was not very pleasing .
however , this was our experience .
not a fan of anything here .
bbq was disgusting and swimming in grease .
potato salad was also old tasting and could not eat .
and it was over $ _num_ for lunch .
not worth the drive , parking , or time .
slow service con this cold and wet monday .
mac & cheese was watery .
this place was a huge disappointment for me .
i had the worst lunch of all times here today .
i had such awesome memories of it and the food was to die for .
worst of all , our server gave us the worst service .
never once quality checked us .
i did n't leave a tip and i am a former server !
for southern home cooking , this was an insult .
im sorry .
the worst experience on my first outing in my city .
i waited for _num_ minutes before anyone came and spoke to me .
this is n't the first time this happened .
overall i was very stuffed at the end of my meal .
overall , my experience was just ok , but nothing memorable .
although nothing was awful , i would n't come back .
i really , really wanted to like this place .
apparently this is the place to go for some good ole greasy soul food .
today , i was beyond disappointed .
the service was a _num_ .
after i told her my order she repeated something completely different .
she laid it down and walked off .
never have i ever actually left a restaurant and not left a tip .
i did not leave a tip .
then i waited another _num_ minutes for them to get me my food .
after receiving my food i walked back to my hotel to enjoy some bbq .
i also got mac and cheese , bbq ribs , and green beans .
do not insult your customers bc you recognize a ny accent .
i will not be going there nor will i be recommending anyone to visit .
i had the beef ribs , collards , and mashed potatoes .
no bueno .
my boyfriend had the salmon patties which he said were just ok .
overall i was underwhelmed and disappointed .
i got the fried chicken with greens and beans .
the chicken was crispy and to die for .
the greens were just succulent .
however , we will not be back .
a long wait and not being greeted at the door for about _num_ minutes .
the only thing that was remotely redeeming was the cornbread , that was good .
how this place got _num_ stars out of _num_ i 'll never know .
needless to say i did not get to .
i was beyond put off by this and thought it to be very unprofessional !
they were not that busy at all .
such a shame .
however , on my second visit we had terrible service .
the mac and cheese and cornbread was all we ate .
it took _num_ minutes for our food to be brought out to us .
we were not pleased and will definitely not be visiting this restaurant again .
the rice was bland and the dish over all had no spice .
i had visiting family and they tried to sit us at separate tables ?
this is unacceptable for any restaurant !
my recommendation is to go elsewhere and save yourself the trouble !
i ordered chicken wings as an appetizer ... ummm that was definitely a given !
the chicken wings were delivered nice and hot , crispy but lacking in flavor .
the macaroni and cheese ... well it was mostly cheese and not much macaroni .
so overall , i was super disappointed with our lunch at mert 's .
staff was n't very friendly .
not awful but there has to be better places with southern home cooking !
the peaches were n't even sweet .
on her worst day her cooking never tasted this bad .
food was just ok , nothing special .
i ordered the salmon cakes with mac & cheese and yams .
the yams were suppose to be candied yams but were very bland .
it took about _num_ minutes before we even got our drinks .
my boyfriend ordered shrimp and grits .
i ordered the fried catfish plate with macaroni & cheese and collard greens .
the macaroni & cheese tasted like off brand cheese mixed with heavy butter .
my collard greens was way too salty .
all the other food seems very commercial and lacks flavor .
and you must be willing to overlook the horrible service as well .
i want to give this place no stars but it 's not an option .
i then ordered the fried chicken , collard greens and mac & cheese .
the service is really bad .
it 's ridiculous .
been here twice and each time slow slow service .
the food ( breakfast ) was ok .
very bland .
the chicken was flavorless tasted like flour .
the worst fried chicken ever .
the beans and rice were not much better .
my mom had a fried shrimp po ' boy with mac and cheese .
dessert we split a slice of german chocolate cake .
i recently visited mert 's for a brunch date and was so excited .
i ordered the french toast with the western omelette and home fries .
i ordered the fried catfish along with yams & mac n ' cheese .
so disappointed ... .
my fiance had ribs that were mostly fat and gristle .
this is n't it .
id give _num_ 1/2 stars .
no thanks .
not impressed .
ordered oj , they did n't have it , charged us for it anyway .
turkey was not cooked ( raw inside ) .
what a waste !
i was sadly disappointed .
the pork chops were super thin and dry .
my colleague ordered the chicken fingers with mac and cheese and collard greens .
while her sides were delicious she thought the chicken fingers missed the mark .
i tired this place because people raved about their food .
when we arrived the hostess was very unpleasant .
when our food arrived , my collard greens had tomatoes and onions .
the person i was with , asked the server for gravy .
i would never go back to this place .
the service was terrible and the food was not all that great .
as for the food .
the collard greens were hard , crunchy and gritty .
quite frankly they were disgusting .
salmon cakes were just ok .
if you are in search of soul food , i would look elsewhere .
i follow drive diner dives he raved about this place .
but you must pay to park .
ordered the chopped bbq , mac n cheese and yams .
food was not worth the wait .
will not go there again !
avoid this place at all costs .
the chicken wings were absolutely horrid .
there was no flavor , and the skin was not crispy .
the shrimp grits was disgusting as well .
the rice was too dry , and there was barely any flavor .
i am incredibly horrified by this place and will never come back .
unfortunately , mert 's is a failure to the soul food world .
the service was n't horrible , it was just slow .
the cabbage was decent , but my cabbage looked moldy , yikes !
the macaroni and cheese was old and dry .
i am completely disappointed .
will not return and i do n't recommend you waste your money here .
this place has an overall _num_ star review for a reason .
collard greens had to be the worst i have ever had .
my salad was serviced in a tea cup plate .
my first ... ... .
!
the food was substandard at best .
i ordered beef ribs that were more fat than meat .
and the vegetables just did n't have a clean taste to them .
but boy oh boy was i completely disappointed in my meal !
we should 've just went some where else .
my boyfriend ordered the salmon creole with cabbage and a garden salad .
he was n't satisfied at all .
so my meal was the beef ribs with macaroni and cheese and cabbage .
but the beef ribs were okay and so were the side .
it was just okay nothing special at all !
we both left full but totally unsatisfied .
the menu was very very small .
this place was southern food with zero flavor or heat .
walked in and the hostess was talking to someone she knew .
so we make our decisions .
we get the drinks and never see him again .
we waited _num_ minutes for our food !
i asked for a glass of wine .
i sent it back and walked out .
both were awful .
it 's no where close to `` cream of '' anything .
next time , i 'll keep walking to johnny burritos .
- sandwiches are nothing special and over priced !
kettle one with soda - everyone knows that 's soda water right ?
after 5+ years a friend that `` loves '' it talked me into it .
unfortunately it will have to be another _num_ years before i try it .
no value .
chopped red onion totally overpowered .
it was almost another 20-30 minutes before he brought out our dinners .
sounds like poor kitchen line management that should be corrected .
hell 's kitchen would n't stand for it .
lucky we did n't have clients with us this evening .
the dish had fine flavor but was nothing special .
the entire experience was certainly below my expectations .
had to argue with staff that a martini does not only have two ounces !
corn bread was like cardboard .
however , the management is very lacking .
we left hungry and disappointed .
service was friendly , but slow .
i do n't think i 'll give this place another chance .
i even ate a couple and the sauces were yummy .
a super gross out peeve of mine .
we had a disappointing experience with customer service regarding a group reservation .
pork chop was terrible and food was cold .
if i could give mimosa grill `` _num_ '' stars , i would .
i made a reservation with mimosa for my family 's thanksgiving meal in _num_ .
secondly , the chef had sizzling salmon on the buffet .
the rest of the food was overly heavy and greasy .
but , hey , at least i did n't gain weight over the holiday .
wrong !
atmosphere is not that unique , elevator music .
alot of better options uptown .
so , that gets a low mark in my book .
as for the brunch itself , it was very charlotte .
eggs , green beans , mac and cheese were all above par .
the prime rib was overcooked and dry .
so , this looks like a three star review .
only a half step above a chain restaurant .
the hush puppies were spot on .
for dessert i had the apple pie cheesecake .
it was not edible .
and , the food is not up to par .
but the food was not so great .
i went here for sunday brunch trusting all the good yelp reviews .
however , i was extremely disappointed .
all the food was cold and clearly had sat around for a long time .
the servers were not friendly .
stay away unless you have extra money for cold food and bad service .
went for queens feast tonight .
my stomach has n't been right since i ate it .
which they assured me was not undercooked .
figured they could n't mess up creme brle ... .
but it was room temp and runny .
wo n't be back for dinner .
the mac and cheese was n't anything special either .
just ok food and service is not the greatest .
their chicken sandwich was ordinary and the fries came out a little cold .
as for the food , price does not fit the quality or size .
bad service , expensive food that 's average at most .
would n't recommend this place for sunday brunch .
buffet only with a limited tapas menu .
_num_ person simply sat our mimosas on the table and did n't speak .
it was _num_ at that point .
overall poor service .
which were n't anything to write home about .
i do n't know , maybe we came on an off night .
really _num_ 1/2 stars .
he looked annoyed that we stopped him and showed no level of customer experience .
horrendous service and mediocre food .
do n't even waste your time with this restaurant .
just awful in every sense of the way .
the only redeeming quality is the decor .
atmosphere was a _num_ .
service was a _num_ .
our server seemed like he was trying to drag out our order .
gave me my drink - left .
( that was about _num_ minutes in itself . )
cue _num_ minutes after that - finally received our entrees .
it was n't even a super busy night either .
i guess the kitchen staff was very slow that evening .
the food and the drink i ordered were so mediocre it 's ridiculous .
i ordered the spiced pear drink and it was terrible .
sadly , dinner tuesday evening on my most recent trip was a disappointment .
pecan crusted trout was tasteless .
a little seasoning ( salt , pepper ? )
no mushrooms .
i imagined smashed potatoes to be a bit more mashed .
the asparagus was more shaved and less than one full piece .
short rib was good but i expected a bit more juice .
.
our water glasses were empty and my wife wanted another cosmo .
we drove _num_ hr .
longhorn or any number of establishments are better at half the price .
came here for lunch once , did n't particularly care for it .
i will not be returning .
went here for my birthday and was so disappointed .
that 's the ultimate turn off .
wo n't be going there again .
so turned off by this club .
some chick tried to take me upstairs and charge me _num_ dollars per song !
first and last to this club .
very pricy , poor service and no contact dance .
very disappointed ... .
worst strip club i 've ever been to .
it 's $ _num_ ! ''
when you stop spending money they are off to another table .
fyi : no smoking in any bar or restaurant anywhere in north carolina .
sorry but it 's nc law .
i was very disappointed last night .
worst place ever !
avoid this place at all costs !
what they are doing is not right and needs to stop immediately .
the place sucks , and closes at _num_ am .
i get it , it 's a strip club ... but damn .
really low standards .
even with the munchies at 2am this place is bad .
i am torn on this late night pizza joint .
suggestions : clean up your unprofessional and rude staff !
to me , it 's just your average , run of the mill pizza .
other than that , this place is grimy , creepy , and nasty .
slices are so bland and bad .
nothing special here .
they would n't give me a water for a dollar .
ate the pizza dry as shit .
when we called , she was informed that we did get the wings .
ordered at order here sign .
cashier asks me to repeat my order to him .
what a bunch of idiots .
upon arriving the service was ridiculous .
rude , short with customers and overall just made my pickup not pleasant .
how do you mess up a slice of cheese pizza .
and now i realize why i only come here after a night of drinking .
the uptown location is awful .
we ordered wings , bbq chicken pizza ( no onions ) and garlic knots .
the estimated arrival time was _num_ minutes .
another _num_ minutes later and our order finally showed up .
disgusting .
the terrible service or the endless amount of disrespect ?
the buffalo chicken sub was yummy but cold .
anyway , the second time i came here was with my boyfriend .
the place is very cozy .
drinks are at least $ _num_ a pop .
unfortunately the food was far from impressive .
the dinner ( some kind of fish ) was salty .
i found a long blond hair in my fish .
the waiter comp my meal out .
in conclusion ... yea ... we 're not coming back .
my husband and i went here during restaurant week & left feeling disappointed .
our waiter was not very attentive .
we both got the seafood salad as an appetizer and it was just ok .
it was not impressive .
overall we were very disappointed , especially with the good reviews we had read .
we will not go back .
and that is not a compliment .
we did not want a full bottle as we were headed to the theater .
then came the worst main courses ever !
the pasta itself was good , but the sauce ruined everything .
we were so disappointed .
the food is good but nothing to write home about .
what is worse is the food is bland .
they way we were greeted was unacceptable .
the food is terrible ... .
so why would you love it ?
me `` okay ... i guess ? ''
i got no lettuce tomatoes etc as i requested .
this place only exists because of its prime downtown location .
we skip by it now .
shame as it was one of our favorites .
internet access was $ _num_ for every _num_ hours .
parking was $ _num_ .
breakfast ( mediocre food ) was $ _num_ .
room service food was overpriced .
left feeling like it was not a good deal at all .
i will look for a more hospitable hotel next time i 'm in charlotte .
there was not a single knock or a phone call .
would n't the lobby call or knock on my door ?
manager did not even offer to comp my _num_ hour stay either !
terrible way to start my vacation !
clean rooms .
one star .
it 's only because they wo n't let me give it zero stars .
needless to say i have crossed all hilton hotels off my traveling list .
just an all around poor experience and i will not be back .
none of this was provided upon arrival .
the staff was very unhelpful .
there is no valet .
i was unhappy with my room upon arrival .
the desk staff immediately found me another room .
i finally settled in my room , which was ok - nothing special .
i walked to find dinner .
options were limited - subway and chinese food .
i would not stay here again .
grossly overpriced .
if there were _num_ stars that 's the rating this place would get .
and why is this place called an `` irish pub '' ?
but most of the time this place just falls flat .
the bartender downstairs was extremely rude .
i will not be returning .
needless to say , i will not be going back to this place .
i 'm not sure i 'd call them a deli .
not by a long shot .
they have food , and they even have subs , but a deli ?
service was n't too hot .
but it was n't very good .
the meat itself was dry - anyone can get greasy burgers .
possibly the worst in town .
i wanted them to , but they just did n't .
drinks : their drink specials are nothing to write home about .
$ _num_ for a warm corona ?
do n't waste your time and money .
not the place to be .
crowd was dull .
this place is terrible , never go here ever .
it took an hour to get my mediocre wings .
music was awful last saturday .
made the beer in plastic taste worse .
i was really excited to checkout brixx .
_num_ minutes later , we finally got his attention to request the bill .
salad was somewhat wilted greens drenched in dressing .
the pizzas my husband and i ordered were mediocre .
the waitress was so impatient .
from there it only went downhill .
she did n't come back to the table after that for _num_ minutes .
)
meh ... i do n't get it .
brixx just did n't do it for me .
but that 's where the good stops ... unfortunately .
and for me i 'd rather pay more to get better tasting food .
i did n't like the crust , or the sauce and it arrived lukewarm .
ugh .
i might not have liked the wood fried pizza .
brixx is not the case !
my wife 's cheese pizza was like wet cardboard .
all in all , i 've found better things to spend $ _num_ on .
he did not agree that wifi for customers was a good idea .
he thought they would `` stay too long '' .
one word , ugh .
dirty floor , cardboard pizza .
few times i was incorrectly charged and impossible to get corrected .
unfortunately , that 's where the good stuff ends .
the gym facilities are atrocious .
also , what kind of idiot buys bottled water as a gift ?
the in house internet is the slowest you will find .
the location is also horrible .
i got precious few hours sleep that night !
i just know that it created a roaring sound in my room .
as you may have guessed , this did not happen .
despite their best effort , no cab was there .
i just was n't impressed !
i showed him my coupon , and asked him if he accepted them .
Neutral
negative experience # _num_ :
my girlfriend walked here to get change for laundry .
the steak is average and it 's over run by boa middle management .
go for the top tier steak ... steer clear of apps .
the service here was very sub-par .
my husband likes steak , but -- - i want to eat healthy .
i had to special order my salad and take off a bunch of junk .
ugh .
oh , i wo n't be coming back .
sadly it was not .
potato gratin ( $ _num_ ) needed an extra _num_ min .
grilled asparagus ( $ _num_ ) it was ok ... but just ok .
eating in the best restaurants in town and when we travel is not unusual .
the calamari and the mozzarella wrapped cheese .
the rest of us ordered the mixed field greens salad which was awful .
none of us even finished half the portion .
even my _num_ year old recognized the poor quality of meat .
my wife had the salmon which was better than the filet but nothing exciting .
the creme brulee and flourless chocolate cake for desert were both amazing .
i would recommend just hitting the bar for these late night after a show .
the service was also only marginal .
i was extremely disappointed with capital grille .
i would have expect better quality of food for a _num_ star restaurant .
this place is terrible .
we will never return to this establishment for a meal again .
for starters i got the mozzarella basil tomato salad .
but that is not what you go to a steakhouse for .
the service was more awkward than attentive .
my family and i were out for a very special occasion .
apologizing of course , but still uncomfortable .
it turned out mostly mediocre .
do not fall for the hype .
i made reservations for nye probably around _num_ weeks in advance .
it was all downhill from there .
that did not matter since we were _num_ years younger than every other patron .
i should 've known better .
overly intrusive server did n't help .
service was very awkward , like i was his first table -- ever .
i doubt i will ever set foot in this place again .
the balsamic whatever sirloin was awful .
literally the worst steak i 've had in a year or two .
still waiting on more phone calls to be returned .
i also ordered a jerk chicken sandwich .
cold cold cold .
either way , i am not taking the chance again with this place .
not that the food was bad , mind you .
it was just meh .
chicken was a bit dry .
not enough gooey cheesy saucy mess .
now that would have been an improvement .
the worst food ever .
there was no mention of cheese on the menu for the meal .
hands down , not worth your time or money !
slow service ( even though we were the only customers in place ) .
and let us not forget the worst restrooms ever .
do n't waste your time or money !
but beyond that , total meh .
the food is not very special at all .
each day they also have a $ _num_ lunch special .
generic , but what else do you expect from most downtown businesses .
service was nice , the place was fairly empty .
this is what knocked the 3rd star off .
overall not a bad experience .
get your shit together .
should always tip cause they do n't really get paid by the restaurant .
sundays paper sometimes is no bigger than a big city 's week day paper .
guess i got spoiled by the washington post .
nothing happens .
so now i am out $ _num_ and never got a paper .
the paper got thinner and thinner for a city the size of charlotte .
finally ... this fee based to get news online is a complete joke .
i tried paying my bill online .
so i called on monday to get a real person .
so why does my bill say different .
i did not have one of those .
paper ripped or shredded , give it to them anyway .
they never fix the problem , or attempt to make it right .
it is expensive .
everyone hates it and they do n't care about their community .
he was diligent and never had a problem for _num_ years .
did not receive another paper until july 6th .
made numerous phone calls and emails saying the problem was being addressed .
it is a crap shoot do i get the paper ?
sounds sorta like stealing , does n't it ?
called manager twice only to leave voicemail .
customer service is not even located in this country .
signed up to have daily paper and never received _num_ paper .
i 've been on hold for _num_ minutes so far .
this is the 6th time i 've called them about the same issue .
these people are unbelievable !
voicemail is all you get with no returned calls by the way !
ugh worst serves ever !
besides , one can google any recipe online for free .
called manager twice only to leave voicemail .
customer service is not even located in this country .
update !
and all they do is apologize but ca n't solve any problems .
did not get the thanksgiving day paper that i paid extra for either .
it was just not worth the aggravation any longer .
that would have been the wife and she would have said hell no !
i did n't even answer them back .
the rating is a zero !
worst paper on the planet .
major fail !
we made a reservation ( no need ) for 7pm on saturday .
second best my margarita ( s ) that our server made was awesome !
gross !
all in all this meal was just sad !
she then brings out the salmon ... gosh that poor friend who ordered salmon .
disappointed is an understatement .
i will not be back .
the worst service ever .
avoid this place at all costs .
the food is disgusting .
i honestly never had food this horrible in my entire life .
do n't bother with this place .
waited about _num_ - _num_ minutes .
avoid at all costs .
do n't bother going .
so i left .
horrible business model .
thanks but no thanks .
nothing in charlotte is that special for me to go through all that .
no joke , not polite , or friendly just rude and a jerk .
they only allow certain tiny bags in or clear plastic bags .
are u kidding me $ _num_ for a mediocre meal !
tried chicks for lunch a few weeks ago and was not impressed .
i always notice that chicks is super slow .
the food was not good however .
the lo mien tasted way too greasy and was flavorless .
the chicken tasted like mystery meat .
the smell from when i got the food was just not appetizing .
only two stars due to the lack of selection .
$ _num_ car bomb shots !
other than that , they really do n't have any other specials .
the selection here is horrible .
trash .
oh , i forgot , the piss is also really expensive .
upstairs and outside areas are tight too .
seems ridiculous and all about $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ !
immediately walking in you are struck by a smell .
lots of tables and benches or chairs .
they even had corn hole .
the vibe felt kind of lame , it was n't for me .
never again well i spend money in this establishment .
the smell of urine when you walk in is overwhelming .
and the jersey - boy bartenders have major attitude .
not an authentic irish bar , by any means .
i felt really unwelcome the entire time i was in the store .
this is not the customer service i would expect at a high end jeweler .
called this morning to check about the watch .
no one call me at all .
run away if you could this place just straight up ridiculous terrible .
i wish if i can even remove the _num_ star rating .
the bread was stale , and after waiting _num_ minutes i was definitely disappointed .
well my reuben had barely had any meat and no _num_ island dressing .
the bread was soggy and you could not even tell it was toasted .
my wife ordered a chicken salad on pita , minus lettuce and tomatoes .
the bagels here are n't as good as everyone said they would be .
avoid at all costs .
minus _num_ star for that .
well , not so much .
they lacked the variety of bagels and cream cheeses i am used to seeing .
as we all know bagels are n't the easiest breads to bite .
i just need to avoid bagel sandwiches ... .
if you 're in a hurry , do n't come here .
very slow .
i 've been standing in line for _num_ min .
he could n't remember what i ordered .
if you 're in a hurry do n't come here .
i would hire any number of them at any time .
their most recent management change has left the place without a soul .
the service is lousy .
horrible .
same sandwhich never costs the same price .
sad , cause i always was a fan of this company .
terrible service .
good bagels , but it had horrible customer service .
this is really frustrating , especially at this time of day .
the garden veggie soup is watery , not recommended .
that may be an exaggeration , but probably not .
i do n't need this , seriously .
i will not be going back again .
oh , how i wish there was a good seafood restaurant here !
will not go back .
not a bad place but there are many others in charlotte that are better .
so if you are looking for atmosphere , not your place .
i did n't see the hostesses smiled once during the meal .
the bisque was lukewarm at best .
the chocolate cake was cold & hard .
either way , i wo n't be coming back .
he had never been and what better way to try out a new restaurant .
i had the stuffed shrimp , he had the almond crusted tilapia .
the stuffed shrimp was way too salty and a little fishy .
the tilapia was a complete opposite !
no salt at all !
now i 'm unable to get the points on my reservation .
so unfortunate .
my tuna was cold and was not cooked well .
steak was over cooked .
atmosphere was casual but prices were upscale .
and just walked off .
our waiter was in no hurry to take care of us .
every single bite was perfection !
drop the bad attitude and step it up .
there are load of other upscale establishments in charlotte that get it done .
the experience was nothing close to nice or upscale .
kevin had lobster pasta and i had steak .
waiter no where in sight , i flag down someone for a steak knife .
a couple minutes later a guy comes by with our desserts .
aside from that , the desserts were good .
just nothing to write home about .
i asked for a mount and balance from them and had a good laugh .
they did the same service for $ _num_ .
after visiting this location once , i will not be back .
a few simple items turned into a large bill .
i thought the charges were excessive and questionable services that they stated i needed .
not again for me .
do not take your car here unless you want something messed up !
these guys are the worst shop in charlotte .
they scratched my car .
typical auto repair shop trying to steal money especially from young women .
greyhound is a nightmare !
they charged $ _num_ because i was buying the ticket for someone else .
avoid the dirty dog if you can !
as bus stations go this one is pretty neat , tidy and clean .
if only the free wifi worked more than it did n't .
yes it 's true greyhound really needs to train their employees higher customer satisfaction .
this station lacked in communication in every way possible !
ugh unreal and frustrated to the tee !
is n't that your job ?
and i was denied priority boarding .
but , they act as though i 've asked for the world .
i wish that i did n't have to give this location even one star .
the staff at both locations where the hell did they find them .
that 's not how you treat people .
lazy workers , all rude and incompetent .
you 're job is not at the least bit difficult .
this place is horrible .
it also reeks of a unpleasant scent .
it was a nightmare .
ridiculous i will never patronize again .
kind of service that screams for a _num_ % tip .
somehow still managed to spend _num_ bucks a head .
the downstairs [ outside of our group ] was dead .
on the outside , it looks like a corner business .
to add insult to injury , they try to play the club vibe outside .
drink price : $ _num_ for a beer .
would i go here again ?
it was terrible .
the the service was okay and i was atmosphere was not that great .
i do not see myself returning .
not impressed .
if i am ever in charlotte again i will find another place to eat .
i went back again for half off appetizers , and was horribly disappointed .
for a fri night , the service was slow .
not enough staff .
no wonder empty on friday night .
but food and drinks were disappointing .
it was not a busy night so it was a bit disappointing .
i will not go back .
this was the worst restaurant experience i 've ever had .
at this point we had n't complained .
she added _num_ % gratuity , which was when we asked for a manager .
the manager on duty never stopped by or said anything .
i will not be back .
also , do n't leave fast food on a table in the dining area .
it 's not sanitary .
very very disappointed by how this place accompanied us .
so with that said i 'm not sure i would be back .
very disappointing to say the least .
prime rib sub that was a mass of gristle and fat .
a lobster and seafood sub that tasted like a salt and seafood sub .
cucumbers that had seen much better days before they wound up on my sandwich .
after five minutes of not seeing any hostess , we left .
the second time , we visited in the afternoon for lunch .
needless to say , the one hostess on duty never returned .
and she never acknowledged us previously either .
do n't go there if you 're looking for a quick lunch .
very slow internet .
as for the accommodations themselves , it is your typical hampton , nothing fancy .
i really would not recommend staying here unless there was nothing else available .
if you 're anything else , there are better options in uptown .
dirty and nasty .
this is the place for wan na be steelers fans .
the waitresses were very rude and didnt care about your orders .
not sure about this place .
not sure what the problem was but we were very disappointed .
just not my kind of place .
there really was n't anything in particular that stood out that was horrible .
it never seems that clean .
drink specials are a scam , no price listed on their specialty drinks .
no reason to go to this place , spend your money elsewhere .
ridiculous !
they do not watch the dance floor which is dj lesson # _num_ .
but not in a good way .
i could feel people staring at the backs of our heads as we left .
the only reason we left was because we felt entirely , completely unwelcome .
it 's just a worn out place .
the floor was so sticky i do n't see how anyone was really dancing .
they do n't even really serve breakfast .
do not live here .
my roommate and i recently just moved out and had a terrible experience .
our lease ended on april 3rd and everything went smoothly .
completely unacceptable .
i would strongly advise against living here .
we had carpet , and the oldest , white appliances i have ever seen .
not only am i a professional , but i work two jobs .
i 'm in bed before 8pm on most nights .
it was the most absurd thing i 've ever heard .
the parking in this place is ridiculous .
maybe it 's just the other buildings that are awful ... who knows .
in fact , i advised a friend against living here .
this place was by far the worst place i 've ever lived .
do not go here if you want quick service .
also very over priced .
very poor customer service .
there are too many options in uptown .
i will not try them again .
worst customer service , even by post office standards !
and plus your going to be in line for _num_ minutes anyways .
you should just go to fedex where they gladly accept your patronage .
in addition , it seems a little pricey for what they offer .
disgusting , slow and pathetic .
we waited _num_ minutes for one sub and it ended up being pretty bad .
there was almost no meat on it and the bread was a little stale .
there luckily was a subway up the street .
i would not recommend this cleaner .
clothes were n't pressed correctly & they 're expensive .
on a positive note , they did n't lose any of my items ... .
it 's a convenience store , like walgreens or cvs .
when someone came in , they gave a bland generic greeting .
it felt awkward to be there .
this one feels a bit old , dated and run down .
the room was not very nice .
musty smelling .
bathroom was not up to par to the price of the room .
wireless connection at this place is horrible .
however , staff was nice and accommodating .
probably not .
westin would be a better choice for a little more money .
i was hoping to have a similar experience and was thoroughly disappointed .
i would hate it , but she likes a firm mattress .
_num_ .
hallways and rooms were dim , though the beds were comfortable .
_num_ .
_num_ .
furniture was very dated .
_num_ .
rooms were not quiet to say the least .
i 'll stay elsewhere next time i 'm in town .
_num_ .
parking nightmare .
_num_ .
i 'm sorry but that is a personal pet peeve .
b. you just told me there were no stairs to this exit .
_num_ .
our room overlooked the pool , and some of charlotte .
_num_ .
_num_ .
bad lighting .
terrible .
_num_ .
i thought it was going to rip my skin off .
if we were to stay in uptown again we would stay elsewhere .
for the price this is a _num_ star .
for location this place is a _num_ star .
i would hate to see what a normal room looks like .
tiny bathrooms - could barely close the door with the rug .
poor design .
lots of other hotel choices in the area .
when we complained to the hotel they only switched our room .
not even an apology note .
painfully blah , older business hotel that needs updates and upgrades .
room decor is old and bed was not comfortable .
tv was newer , but remote was terrible .
the ritz ... and then what ?
the walls and doors are paper thin .
we will not be staying here again .
everything was more or less ok except for the noise .
otherwise you will not get a good night 's sleep .
you should sue the pants off the entertainment district for the late night noise .
gross !
i can not believe my experience with this hotel .
the chair in the room was extremely dirty and stained .
it is the worst room i have ever stayed in ever .
we only stayed one night .
the whole experience was awful and uncomfortable .
-the cable tv went out every _num_ minutes .
-the room was just dingy .
this hotel left so much to be desired , sadly .
walked in and smelled the musty smell that other yelpers described .
the water pressure was borderline painful and the shower head was very low .
the bed was hard as rocks and very uncomfortable .
nothing was done to accommodate the crappy situation unfortunately .
this hotel is extremely loud and the walls are very thin .
word to the wise : steer clear of this dump .
however , my room was foul .
there is limited items for those looking for a healthy diet .
will not be my choice for future stays in charlotte .
this was my first trip to charlotte .
ripped curtains , blown out light bulbs in bathroom .
i switched it to another outlet , and , again , no charge .
i called room service , and they never brought them up .
it continued for two hours .
the garbage cans on site were overflowing with garbage for two days .
we were really disappointed in this hotel and will not be returning at all .
made a reservation in may through expedia , which i needed to cancel .
sure , i wrote that down and remembered it _num_ months later .
so , obviously will not be staying there on future visits to charlotte .
complete disappointment !
completely disappointed .
this ruined my anniversary !
the makeup mirror was hanging off the wall ready to fall .
smallest bathroom ever for a hotel i 've stayed in .
it 's tired and needs a major overhaul .
this place is soon so gross .
the carpet has clearly not been cleaned since it was installed .
that 's such an easy fix , it just shows they do n't care .
so gross .
the parking situation is weird so make sure you valet .
also , do n't waste your time with the wifi .
i vote anywhere else .
_num_ .
_num_ .
if you are lucky turn down service will happen .
_num_ .
instead i felt really ripped off .
everything else screamed _num_ .
actually all of the staff i encountered in my _num_ days here were great .
however , the actual hotel room was very disappointing .
the room had a very strong musty smell and was not the cleanest .
the bed and pillows were both very firm and uncomfortable .
the bathroom door did n't close over the rug that was on the floor .
the rooms are just worn out and in mighty need of a facelift .
stay away , there are many better options downtown .
wo n't be back .
loud music until like _num_ am .
they suggested i move rooms but none would be quiet ?
no thanks .
i had to wait in the lobby for hours .
i agree with previous reviewers ... going downhill fast .
wifi , another $ _num_ ( $ _num_ ) to be exact .
needless to say , i would n't stay here again if you paid me .
walls are very thin and you can hear casual conversations of guests next door .
this was my 9th time in charlotte for business .
wish i would have read yelp first .
wifi costs _num_ bucks a night .
valet another _num_ .
the bathroom is total trash .
go for drinks , eat elsewhere .
this place is closed _num_ years ago .
there 's not really an opportunity for any of that at this place .
contact lenses over-priced .
reviewers , we will be looking for another provider for these services .
terrible service and experience !
i am very disappointed and upset right now .
i always tend to see the glass half full , not empty .
but today , i think i have had enough with this place .
nothing has changed .
no call to update me or explain the delay .
get them in , get them out .
screw me over once , shame on you .
shame on me .
shame on me .
blood pressure reading was input in my chart before taking my blood pressure .
spent $ _num_ on a new pair of glasses and they did n't fit .
mistakes happen , i get it , but three strikes and your out .
i was advised by maria that they will come from italy .
the pair never was ordered .
they sent the original glasses off to be filled .
when it was addressed , maria stated she will order again .
my expectations would have been set and i just would have went somewhere else .
our dining experience at this restaurant was the worst i can remember !
i called over the waiter and explained .
avoid this restaurant !
some of the worst customer service i 've ever experienced .
guess that 's worth _num_ stars eh ?
this place is downright bizarre .
the salad was just alright , nothing terribly impressive .
i do n't know much about about french food so i was curious .
and , crab soup so salty , was not edible .
will not be going there again .
i did n't like it and i probably wo n't be back .
very confused by this spot .
it is simply a greek restaurant called french quarter .
everything else ... so-so .
very busy with short wait times .
very loud too .
difficult to hold conversations .
seating too close together .
soup was mediocre .
i 'm totally confused .
not falling for the trick .
terrible selection , rude !
the whole area was pretty rude .
all in all bad experience will never go back due to the rude staff .
was n't overly impressed with the food or beer selection .
not really sure why they call this place the french quarter .
nothing about the menu items say louisiana or french quarter .
my family ordered the bacon burger , chicken fingers , and a greek wrap .
no real kids menu .
the food was very tasty , waitress was very cordial .
the decor was pretty nice but the food left alot to be desired .
ok no biggie , but then came the food .
let me just get your drink orders . ''
i ordered seared ahi tuna salad .
even so , the service was adequate - nothing more , nothing less .
not very friendly and welcoming , just adequate .
sides are ordered separately ; we selected grilled asparagus and potato gratin .
the portions are quite generous but the presentation was way off for me .
the chunks of clay on the wall are interesting , i guess .
i liked the salad , but it was nothing special .
the consistency of the blue crab fondue was a little too runny .
the little copper pot it came in was cool though .
at $ _num_ , i was not impressed .
one more time she came out and honestly i was getting pissed off .
they had no baked potatoes .
so , i just asked her , what do you have .
mashed potatoes was my only choice .
for $ _num_ , they ca n't find i potato ?
the steak was served on top of the overly buttered mash potatoes .
i ate them , but nothing special .
after $ _num_ for _num_ people , i was not impressed .
as the website states , with asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes .
false advertisement .
left in _num_ minutes and booked room across the street at la quinta .
wish i could have given red roof a quarter of a star .
do n't stay here .
it 's like they are trying to make the ghetto look classy .
my room was smoke free yet it reeked of smoke and a horrible smell .
i will never return to red roof in .
_num_ came and went and no shuttle .
the shuttle driver claimed he was never told about a _num_ pickup .
i would n't recommend at all parking your car there for the airport .
room does not look like hotels.com photos .
do not stay here .
probably the worst hotel ever .
something fishy is def going on here .
worst hotel !
this is a standard gas station and not really worth reviewing .
she asks me what i ordered .
my sandwich was dripping with sauce and had everything on it !
she turned out to be the only pleasant person during my whole experience .
was the fourth car in line and have been sitting here for _num_ minutes .
now i wait at the menu with no response ... .
wo n't be back .
worst experience ever at a wendy 's !
my daughter 's drink order was wrong to start .
then it took forever to get our burgers .
while we wait our fries are sitting on b the tray getting cold .
once we received our burgers one was wrong .
after getting it corrected my fries were then really cold .
i asked for ketchup and was handed _num_ packets .
avoid this location if you can .
every other experience there was nearly as bad .
my friend was transferred to this hospital from the south park emergency room .
they kept her there for _num_ nights which is unheard of .
they took a ct scan but we never received results , still have n't .
the nurse said nothing and just kept going .
i am not sure how someone thinks this food is great .
it is subpar and out of the freezer .
nothing is homemade and food is dry .
grocery stores are always open .
( sigh ) ... so here 's why i 'll never shop here again .
so i 'm reading the back .
then i see it : `` this finished product not tested on animals . ''
and then i just got mad .
do they think we are idiots ?
excuse the rant , but this just really pissed me off .
restaurant had a horrible cleaned my smell as well .
worst service i have ever had two visits in a row .
our waiter was awful .
had to track down another server twice for drink refills and our check .
rude employees .
will not be back to that location !
but when it came out it just looked like a bowl of lard .
it also felt like i was eating a bowl of lard .
i should have probably ordered from the diet menu .
have n't had this bad of an experience in a while .
service was extremely slow .
hit and miss for lunch and summer .
pathetic , no other way to describe this brunch .
i did have breakfast here once before and it was n't this bad .
i stop her from running off because the food looks suspicious .
sure enough the poached eggs were hard boiled .
it 's been _num_ minutes since i first ordered .
sad to say , this was a big mistake .
food : sub-par for your money .
free bread : none .
food : sub-par for your money .
free bread : none .
i felt like i was asking an enemy for a favor .
never use this place .
do not recommend .
hard to believe how they stay in business .
i am very upset and disappointed with the service that i have received .
now , almost two weeks later , my order still has not arrived .
the customer service is not what i expected .
these books were needed last friday for a class that meets on mondays .
this is unacceptable .
would n't go back .
but then he asks if he can see the earrings and necklace .
sadly that is n't the end .
i 've worked in the jewelry business , and i know what i like .
i was very clear in the preferences i stated .
you do n't tell a customer what to like .
that 's unacceptable .
oh but that 's not all folks .
if there were zero stars i would give that rating instead !
if there were zero stars i would give that rating instead !
anyway , we were dropping off three rings .
seriously , and it gets much worse .
and turn around and walk the hell out of there , seriously .
horrible customer service .
how rude !
this is the worst customer service i have ever experienced .
not a way to gain a new customer !
my wife then confirmed her day off from work .
i 'd give this company zero stars if it were an option .
they came quickly - only three days from when we reported the problem .
when two weeks go by , i called to check in .
no one answered the phone during business hours .
neither of our messages were returned .
the worst customer service ever !
probably the least professional business i 've ever worked with .
on the 2nd load every it refused to turn off .
first go around - not too bad .
the owner was beyond rude !
made many promises and failed to keep them .
claimed his repair guy was out of cell range all day .
very rude and unprofessional guy !
not willing to work out anything with the customer .
he did not even offer to make an appointment after his busy time .
would not recommend this company to anyone .
zero stars for this guy .
my home warranty company gave me the number to carolina appliance service .
i assume he was the owner because he said `` my company '' .
that is ridiculous !
i will not be working with carolina appliance service again .
its consistent , bad service or lack there of .
well that 's sure different , way to waste money on that .
the store itself is fairly clean and generic .
there was no voicemail option .
i have never in my life encountered such awful customer service .
we will never use sam 's club again .
i am so sick of walmart and sam 's club associates .
both walmart and sam 's club need to learn valuable customer service .
customer service is a joke .
horrible customer service !
said something to manager and they did n't care .
extremely rude .
completely ripped me off .
everything else is nasty .
go back to florida , they like it there .
bland bbq , bland chicken .
this location was kind of busy .
we still had not gotten any drinks and not placed an order .
when she came back and had nothing i gave up .
he knew he had issues , bad people and a huge problem .
i visited around lunch time and the food was not that good .
the entree was a dry .
i am sorry , but i wo n't be back .
i do n't know where to start .
god turned water into wine well i will never be back .
i drove past this place on almost a daily basis for a couple years .
when our food finally arrived it was a disappointment .
my brisket was completely dry , as was the cornbread .
the baked potato was overcooked and the beans super sweet with no smoke .
corn bread just taste bad .
it is n't worth it and is n't typical for the south .
do n't eat here !
do not recommend .
so go thee instead .
i visited nc and thought this place was disgusting , i sure was right !
never ever going back .
my experiences have not been satisfactory at all .
save yourself the frustration !
i have never received worse customer service .
and she has been rude and nasty to me since .
i really could care less at the moment .
anyway , appointment starts and we go into separate room .
every vet i 've been to takes the temp through her ear .
it seemed a little rough .
do n't you do this all day ?
could n't you have told me to move ?
overall , kind of an irritating experience .
the staff did n't seem to `` get '' dogs .
i do not recommend south charlotte animal hospital .
i came in for my first visit and was very disappointed .
the nurse was very short with me .
what animal hospital does not stock those items ?
for an annual , the price was outrageous .
i will not be returning .
they did my cuticles so badly that i was bleeding a whole lot .
do n't bother making an appointment for this place .
that goes for the dated , smelly theater as well .
on this beautiful friday evening there was no ticket office open .
never fear , she sold us a ticket .
it 's terrible .
she poured me a _num_ oz pour and charged me around $ _num_ .
this theatre is dying , do n't waste your money .
this place is filthy and outdated .
the bathrooms are yuck and this whole place should be redone !
nasty !
as for their food options , they 're not great .
that was _num_ minutes of my life that i 'd like back .
the food sucks and is way overpriced as is the souvenirs .
we had no problems using our admission ticket or parking ticket .
Neutral
the snack was another problem .
skip this .
- workers : rude , rude , rude .
are you kidding me ?
do n't buy your tickets online !
staffs are disrespectful and do n't want to help at all .
lines are short and fast because the place is near empty .
most we had to wait was _num_ minutes .
specific problem is the incredibly poor customer service attitude .
poor , poor customer service .
wow just really bad .
carowinds in my opinion is crap .
poor customer service in all parts of the park .
managers of the park know this and they dont do a thing about it .
carowinds for that they offer is not worth the drive or the money .
im done w this place .
first parking is a joke and a crime .
this is n't just for premium parking , but its for general too .
some of the bathrooms were really old and disgusting .
should have wait times listed for rides .
staff is n't polite or even nice for that matter .
park is n't very clean .
bathrooms are filthy and smell awful .
i would not recommend purchasing extras online .
only purchase the basic tickets .
we had a printed voucher that we paid for that was n't honored .
$ _num_ mistake ( _num_ people ) .
nowhere on the dinosaur tickets we purchased does it say anything about that time !
last saturday , i paid for my ticket and headed in .
no .
- $ _num_ for chicken tenders and fries ?
no other entertainment was available while we were there .
wo n't make the _num_ hour drive again from charleston .
much better value for money spent .
wrong !
saving up that six hundred bucks to go elsewhere .
park was beyond rude and unhelpful about it .
food is expensive and nasty .
when we finally got off after your employees gave zero communication .
it was a waste of my day time and money .
it 's sad when a park can only give you a drink for compensation .
however , it 's not worth it here .
it took one kid _num_ minutes to refill our drink .
it 's miserable . ''
carowinds has horrible line management .
on top of that , my boyfriend and i encountered the rudest staff there .
avoid this place if you have the option .
they should be closed down for good and removed from the park .
_num_ cents ?
what is really bad is the food was horrible !
really , you do n't know the answer to that simple question ?
if i could give this place zero stars i would .
the customer service is atrocious .
ummm ... excuse me !
if anything goes wrong you 'll get the worst help ever .
i 'm very disappointed with the way carowinds is run .
all the employees were extremely rude and seemed to hate their jobs .
one employee yelled at me and my dad for nothing !
never have i had these problems at carowinds until this year !
so sad carowinds has become such a disappointment .
plus do n't even try complaining to guest services .
they could care less about your complaints and then tell you some bs excuse .
we sadly left with extreme disappointment !
i will not recommend anyone to go to the park .
will not go back to carowinds !
unfortunately , we recently had a very disappointing experience at carowinds .
the line was over three hours long .
it was not , it was also almost three hours long as well .
cindy , the manager on duty , was rude from the beginning .
she had no response and again told us we were essentially out of luck .
drove _num_ hours to get to the park .
still charging $ _num_ plus $ _num_ for parking .
i would definitely not take your family .
i would give _num_ stars if i could .
worst experience of my families life .
then tons of school kids were breaking lines and nothing being done .
ridiculous .
check your credit and debit cards after use in carowinds !
kids and even adults were so annoyed and started cutting lines .
same with food , souvenirs and entrance tickets .
my husband and i just moved to charlotte and live about _num_ mins away .
the worst .
we only spent maybe _num_ mins in that line .
then our day took a turn for the worse .
we did n't get to ride that .
do n't get excited like i did .
_num_ .
_num_ .
did n't see it till we had already taken drinks .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
so , i am really really disappointed carowinds .
worst food ever got sick .
i been here before then said you can sit down now .
so these guys almost made me spend $ _num_ for unnecessary repairs .
the manager then pushed a full set of tires my way for $ _num_ .
worst place ever .
for nothing i needed !
duke energy is the only electric company in town .
their customer service is terrible .
five days later i get a bill for three previous months !
they asked if i was sure i only moved in five days earlier .
the company is run by morons .
if you live in the area , i guess you have no choice .
duke energy pulled some really shady crap on us .
horrible customer service .
worst experience on the phone with customer service ever !
please do not support a place that sells puppy mill dogs .
i do not recommend going here .
i was searching for an independent little place to pick up dog food .
not impressed .
the woman in charge was downright rude .
do not recommend !
please do not buy fish from this store they will rip you off .
nothing more ; nothing less .
what a waste .
it 's $ _num_ a head .
finally , no one takes credit cards ... even for the admission charge .
not a good mix .
on the week ends it is $ _num_ dollars .
should have only paid per ride .
do n't really remember it being so bad when i was younger lol .
felt like someone was holding my whole body down .
hot dog was not bad but nothing to write home about .
they did have a free petting zoo and horse ride was eight dollars .
i should have let my nephew finger paint my car instead .
the guy ( tom ) , acknowledged everything i was saying .
so i dropped it off for a week .
when i picked it up : _num_ .
they did n't even paint the roof .
_num_ .
no body work was done .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
whatever you were thinking of getting done ... do n't do it there .
there is paint on the grill and damage from where the tape was removed .
both cars left the shop looking worse than they did when they entered .
customer service leaves much to be desired .
ridiculously overpriced for the finished product and experience .
no call .
saturday rolls around , no call .
the next week starts , still no call .
over _num_ hours after they say it 'll be ready .
not ready .
entire car was dusty , inside and out .
truly the worst customer experience ever .
they do n't provide it because they do n't want you to find them .
but when i 'm on a budget i choose motel _num_ .
then to top it off the remote does n't even work for the tv .
no way to rate a _num_ !
the room smelled awful .
only _num_ towels for _num_ people !
even when we asked for more towels they said only _num_ per room .
_num_ battery in the tv remote and the phone did n't work .
i also wore my shoes in the shower because of how unsanitary it was !
this is probably the worst hotel i 've ever stayed in .
i was on a long trip from florida and stopped here for the night .
i wish i would have taken photos .
i have never been to a less taken care of establishment .
this hotel is old and poorly managed .
they have a sanitation rating of _num_ % .
when i got a refund the next day it was $ _num_ short !
why am i being charged for your mistakes ?
not nearly impossible , literally impossible .
my room reeked of mold and mildew .
nasty hotel !
the next room was worse .
i could not believe it .
on the 3rd floor , with no elevator in sight .
like stains from washing and not coming out of the sheets .
i had to flush like _num_ times for it to clear the bowl .
the water was very hard .
it got cold at night .
we could not leave it on while gone from the room .
the room itself was not too bad .
i would stay at a days inn again , but definitely not this one .
no customer service .
when i went in to discuss , i heard another patient checking in .
the doctor prescribed me medication that i am allergic to .
went on the visit and nothing was done .
they are lazy ass hell !
do n't waste your money or time .
find another place where the doctors care .
i do n't know what is happening to medicine patients appointments etc .
it makes me very unhappy .
horrible .
there is a reason this location has such bad reviews .
the front desk staff is the worst i 've ever encountered .
everyone else obviously hates their job and could care less about your medical problems .
avoid uptown at all costs .
because _num_ is n't an option .
extremely poor customer service .
this is `` name brand '' prices for crap clothing .
and we went over by _num_ cent !
drab drab drab .
are you kidding me ?
pay less has better !
sometimes i guess expected good customer service is asking for too much .
this is just ridiculous .
unorganized store with a smaller selection than most old navy stores .
there were clothes all over the ground and nothing was folded .
the manager was also talking with the employees in a loud and inappropriate way .
this location is not well maintained by management .
always extremely slow service and long lines .
crime is a problem !
oops , all the treadmills are occupied .
now it 's getting very ghetto .
the men 's locker room is always nasty .
the toilets are disgusting , and the sauna and steam rooms are never clean .
just cancelled and move to fitness connection for $ _num_ bucks a month .
to be fair , we knew it was pricey .
same with my ginger ale .
slow , slow , slow .
the food just was n't that great , and it was a bit pricey .
nothing wrong with paying up for great food , but blue was n't it .
however , based on previous reviews , the food is hit or miss .
my dinner there was a substantial miss for a pretty substantial price .
side note : the service was phenomenal , no problems in that department .
or if someone else is picking up the tab .
you can go out once and have no desire to ever go out again .
or you can fall in love and find reason to be back daily .
also , i did n't like the quality of the flatbread .
lobster cream sauce should never be flavorless !
the cake di chocolate is standard lava cake ( takes forever to make ) .
not a fan .
maybe if i come back next time i 'll have better luck ?
i am in boston , not charlotte .
i would never patronize a place like this .
if you do , be cautious -- do not give them your email .
ok , i 'm lying .
the service was atrocious and incredibly slow .
so the food is boxed and i come home , nightmare over , right ?
wrong !
so nobody went home with their own food .
not quite horrible , but not quite good either .
edible is a better word for it .
sounds fancy , eh ?
manager : ( blank stare and walks away ) .
needless to say , i will never come back here again .
if it were free , i would probably still pass .
we were excited to dine at blue as part of restaurant week .
i could n't get the taste of char out of my mouth .
um , probably not .
i never tasted such an overwhelming orange dish in my life .
nothing to write home about .
the duck was really rough & fatty .
i preferred them over the duck .
for dessert , we ordered the cheesecake to split .
the food was decent .
service was absolutely horrible !
the young woman did not greet us in the most welcoming manner .
she looked as if she was forced to be there !
never asked us if we wanted another drink nor if are food was good !
it was very bizarre !
for such a nice atmosphere its too bad the service was horrible .
i rarely complain but i have never been treated sooo poorly .
not impressed .
sorry we picked it after reading rave reviews online .
would n't go back .
but not the place if you 're super hungry .
the most recent time i went i was very disappointed .
i do n't know that i 'll recommend my guests here any more .
all _num_ over prices and all _num_ just okay .
and still disappointed .
pop and they were down the hatch !
_num_ star .
_num_ stars .
something tells me there is better seafood out there in charlotte .
what a disappointment , the risotto balls were very bland and gummy .
the only good thing was the lemon drop martini .
i am sorry to be writing this review .
my first visit to blue a few years ago was fabulous .
the calamari appetizer was good , but not worth $ _num_ .
the baked in house bread were blah , and butter was not offered .
but , this evening was an utter disappointment .
btw ... coffee was $ _num_ .
sorry , but i will not go back .
probably would not go back .
do not recommend .
to be honest with you nothing really jumped off the menu to me .
i settled for the beef tenderloin and fried calamari appetizer .
i ordered medium-rare and it was purple , barely cooked in the middle .
simply put , it is overpriced and not worth your money .
went for a girls night for restaurant week .
he picked the risotto balls they were okay , kinda bland .
this was not a good steak .
the cookie was terrible !
it was gross .
do n't think i will be back .
disappointed in my queens feast choice .
wish i could go back and choose again .
i 'm a foodie and disappointed .
no vegan desert option for me ( fresh fruit option , please ?
it all seemed to disappear , though , so that says something !
still , i 'm not sure we will be back anytime soon .
after being seated , it took our waiter forever to come to our table .
what a bummer to spend that much money and be that underwhelmed .
reservation for _num_ on a saturday made with ease .
maybe a warning sign .
it was also very loud .
it kind of set me off for the rest of the meal .
the service was ok , but not great .
our waters were n't refilled but once .
i waffle between _num_ stars and _num_ .
this is a personal experience that stuck with me for years .
beyond that our waitress was rude .
here i am on yelp looking at queen 's feast and i see blue .
you might love this place but i had such a poor experience and follow-up .
this is a personal experience that stuck with me for years .
i consider a brunch with mom on mothers day ruined when mom is apologizing .
here i am on yelp looking at queen 's feast and i see blue .
you might love this place but i had such a poor experience and follow-up .
probably the worst mother 's day brunch in charlotte .
i felt horrible that my husband paid _num_ dollars each for basically an omelette .
the fruit was mediocre .
the salad was n't good .
the vegetable station was n't appealing .
the beef i got was so tough i could n't chew it .
there were very few vegetables to order with it .
we sure wish we had gone somewhere else .
i do n't think we will come here any time again too soon .
it 's a shame .
my husband ordered a whiskey sour and our friends and i ordered bloody marys .
i thought the menu had said tapas style for the table - my bad .
eventually i just gave up .
i asked for a cappuccino for dessert and was told the machine was broken .
mediocre food .
pretentious and overpriced .
i 'm just going to break this down into pros vs cons .
three half pours of wine for like $ _num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
if i ever go back to this restaurant i want approx .
_num_ orders of this .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
( this might be a pro to some ) boyfriend ordered their house cocktail .
he could n't drink it .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
all in all , i promise you can find a better restaurant in charlotte .
did n't really care for the food here .
there are better restaurants to frequent .
blue could be great but it 's not .
there was only one sushi chef on duty .
owner was extremely polite .
waitress was not the best .
surely there are better places in town .
when they do deliver , it always takes longer than the estimated time .
it was bland !
there was no flavor at all .
having limited options in uptown i gave this place a few chances .
it 's just not good .
this is the worst sushi place in charlotte .
the website clearly stated the restaurant closed at 10pm .
all in all , it was def not my best groupon date night .
appetizers got there only _num_ minutes before main course , seriously ?
the kicker , the place was n't busy , not in the least bit .
i will never return here when i come back to charlotte .
strike _num_ .
strike _num_ .
worst chicken pad thai i 've ever had .
was sick to my stomach all afternoon .
of course , i 'm not sure it was really chicken .
the noodles were not good either .
bad move .
worst experience of my life .
i did n't like it .
earlier this week i decided to order a rather large order to be delivered .
the waiter never did refill my water glass .
felt rushed even though other tables were available .
my wife has made multiple phone calls only to have one returned .
horrible college .
i have never seen such a horrible community college in my life time .
i do n't think i 've had a positive experience yet .
you 're better off going in to speak to someone face to face .
do not waste your time here .
you 're better off taking your money elsewhere .
i gave one star because you ca n't give none !
do n't go for the jerk chicken .
i would try something else ... if i go back .
i was sooo very disappointed .
but i always prefer vegetarian and i 've had much much better food elsewhere .
as far as veggies goes , not tasty is for sure .
you get a lot of food but its kind of expensive for lunch .
plates that are old and worn .
it 's sad to see a small business that just does n't get it .
will not go back .
if i could give this place zero stars i would .
very dirty and disgusting .
sat down and he brought out egg noodles and duck sauce .
got up and walked out .
i wish zero stars were an option .
i ate a few bites and tossed most of it in the trash .
there were no other diners in the restaurant .
we ordered the szechuan shrimp and scallops and also the shrimp in garlic sauce .
the place appears dirty , the service is not friendly .
did n't seem to care about having sit-down customers at all .
just a bad experience all around .
gross .
but i 'm not going to anymore .
they simply ca n't get the orders right .
tonight was the last straw .
never ordering from this place again .
this is a trash and security problem .
`` me never come back here '' .
the food here used to be good now it 's trash .
pay for extras that you do n't get when ordering in .
was really disappointed about that .
first of all , the customer service was great !
however , my jaw almost hit the floor when we received our bill .
our total bill was almost $ _num_ .
i did not feel that the dry cleaning was worth that much .
i would recommend others to check the price when you drop off your clothes .
worst auto bell in town .
it was n't even decent enough for one star .
however the content was way too old for my _num_ yr old .
_num_ minutes !
also , what kind of a market does n't have bread you can buy ?
literally , the entire store , no bread !
monday you did n't have meat .
what kind of deli runs out of meat and white bread ?
problem is , there wo n't be a next time .
i try to be fair ... but after _num_ strikes .
i would strongly advise anyone seeking a quality landscaping contractor to look elsewhere .
_num_ dollars ?
i called to say i was going to be ten minutes late .
smells gross all the time , small portions for a hella large price tag .
spend your money eating something w personality !
and the service last time i came was horrible !
the younger girl did them and did a bad job .
she made an excuse that the brush was too big .
she did n't ask me , she told me to come back tomorrow .
there is no tomorrow .
i will not go back !
he never responded to my call for repairs .
maybe my standards are too high .
i had a chicken biscuit , and the boyfriend had egg and bacon .
but the biscuits just do n't cut it for me to try them again .
disappointed .
the flavorless meat drowned in sauce is not acceptable for any real barbecue lover .
i felt like i was robbed .
but it just fails to deliver too often .
to be honest , that sealed the deal for me .
the food just does n't measure up to that kind of poor customer service .
once again , the nurse 's attitude was inexcusable .
long review , but i felt strongly enough that i wanted to post .
she cut me off every time i started to speak .
you do not know the specific circumstances surrounding my situation .
i was so glad it was over .
this place just made me feel so uncomfortable .
do not go here , it 's an utter disgrace .
no bed side manor .
horrible experience and expensive .
in my opinion they could not possibly be legit recommendations .
it 's generic , it 's dull , and it 's over rated .
if they had not i would have left .
the pizza , the calamari , the pasta .
my husband and i ate here this evening .
we were seated promptly without a reservation and the waiter quickly took our order .
the server brought some cold , salty garlic rolls .
my ravioli was barely cooked .
that , like i said , i give up .
i could not agree more that this is so funny .
just plain salty and awful .
they kept the beer and wine flowing at our table at every visit .
the crust was bland and the filling seemed sparse .
i was underwhelmed but my coworkers raved about their dishes .
the bread was already soggy like it had been sitting for a bit .
my friend had calamari that she did n't care for at all .
with grilled veggies and mashed potatoes .
leftovers are in my future .
still , i was n't blown away by it .
i was mildly annoyed because i do n't think she even acknowledged my presence .
i do n't see a return in my future .
goat cheese - this was without a doubt my favorite of anything all night .
it was good but nothing to rave about .
y'all clearly have never eaten outside of charlotte .
both times ive had the penne alla vodka , once again its pretty mediocre .
)
rude !
when i say frequent , i mean every friday .
like one reviewer below mentioned , this is just a step above olive garden .
i have been to italy and this food is nowhere near `` authentic . ''
i 'm not sure why this restaurant gets such a high rating .
i was rather disappointed in most aspects .
the pasta was also overcooked .
this place did n't have the authentic taste i was looking for .
the atmosphere is nice but the food quality was lacking .
totally not worth it .
we used to really like their lasagna and pizza .
even the rolls were almost stale .
guess i will stick to a salad , appetizers and bread pudding .
maybe i 'm weird .
but it seems like recently , everything at mama 's is over seasoned .
one time recently the server was really inattentive .
i took my mom out for her birthday and we left disappointed .
i do n't know why this chef would completely change the perfected dish .
mediocre italian food .
i had a pizza and it was quite bland .
the food here was just adequate .
the waiter said they get really busy so they bring the check first .
we then said : it tastes like peanut butter and she replied : really ?
but does n't nutella tastes like peanut butter to you ?
the last few times out experience was just fair .
they did accommodate us after my request to put _num_ tables together .
it really was n't her fault that the food was awful !
it was pretty average italian food , nothing to write home about .
the bread they bring to the table before dinner was n't very good .
no taste .
i ordered the cheese ravioli and added two meatballs .
shrimp is either cooked or it 's not .
incredibly bad management and ownership .
i know where i am not welcome .
i guess i do n't really have a choice .
i got the penne ala vodka without prosciutto because i do n't eat meat .
i was very disappointed !
they were apologetic when they finally realized my meal was n't touched .
it was much better than the spicy pasta .
in buffalo , we like a little pasta with our sauce .
took money out of my account for late fees .
never notified me , never called nothing .
horrible customer service .
ca n't wait to go back !
worse customer service i have received in quite awhile .
sorry i bothered you from sitting on your *** .
suggestions , maybe do a little housekeeping .
too bad i ca n't give no stars .
will not return ever .
i used to frequent v cleaners & alterations .
_num_ dress shirt .
so from that day forward , i started to patronize them less .
i started referring other people here but i will stop the referrals immediately .
plus the quality is not great and never replace buttons when broken .
i will find a more customer oriented business that appreciates customers .
very condescending people .
we had film developed and the outcome was very poor .
charged for _num_ and only did _num_ .
dishonest , poor quality and bad attitude .
i do n't see how they could possibly have any repeat business .
i had an emergency on the morning i was leaving for europe .
i even questioned it because i said it did n't look right .
really bad service .
when i returned to grab the photos , they were horrible quality .
( this was a different , older man btw ) .
either my tastes have improved or the quality has gone downhill .
recently i placed a take out order .
later , i went to the other bartender for another water .
hmmm , he charged me only $ _num_ .
i bought tickets online _num_ days prior to the show .
if it was made so clear ... why were we having this discussion ?
i was n't impressed at all .
too cramped .
could n't get to the bar .
no service once there .
i took a _num_ lb package to ups and asked for a quote .
first of all , the food came very quickly , which is rare .
the salad was just so-so .
i travel to clt fairly regular on business .
waitstaff was not helpful with the menu .
the food was mediocre at best .
if you really want great indian food ... go to copper .
it 's all about curries , rice , naan and spices .
would i eat here again if i 'm in the area ?
time to find a better indian place , i 'm afraid .
i 'd adventure elsewhere to indian if i were you .
i really want to love this restaurant but i really do n't .
sadly , both experiences were less than stellar .
bland does n't begin to describe the food .
absolutely no taste .
did my irish name cause my order to be overly americanized ?
even my little children were totally unimpressed .
terrible service !
will remove this restaurant from our list of places to go .
very bad service , rude staff , no customer delight .
we hardly could eat anything and left everything like that .
food was very bland and watery .
avoid !
the wait staff had to be reminded several times of what we ordered .
the food was not to my liking at all .
very disappointed .
the food was okay but lacked the spices and taste .
the food was warm and nothing was heating it .
was very disappointed with level of quality and service .
ordered to go and gave clear instructions to have two separate meals .
the vindaloo chicken was not spicy enough and very oily .
the employees spoke very little english and that was a huge barrier .
they also seemed arrogant and rude .
this was the worst indian i 've had in charlotte .
i now know why this place is always empty .
the spice was horrible .
all bland , boring curries and an always empty naan bin .
someone needs to wake up , update , and start cooking with passion .
life is too short .
none of the items were cooked properly .
very very disappointed .
wo n't be back .
the customer service however has been lacking each and every time .
so bad !
the standard is appalling .
he then proceeded to tell me that he only offer _num_ % .
if you ca n't do bother signing up for it .
it was poorly made and poor ingredients were used .
let alone very poor value for portion size .
the worst indian food i have ever had in my life .
there are not much options for buffet on sunday .
food taste was not that great for the money we are paying .
and coming to the taste it is horrible .
menu only have _num_ chicken dishes and both were just average .
disappointed with the quality of the food .
it did not taste authentic .
very disappointed .
it says a lot when your patrons are non indian .
told them it has no spice and they brought hot sauce .
finally this is a place to avoid if you are looking for good food .
i was quite disappointed .
the food ai n't bad .
i was a customer , and my car got towed .
i 'm really confused about the positive reviews of this place .
- just iceberg lettuce and cucumber !
none of these tasted good , tom yum soup was kinda disgusting .
it did n't taste like anything !
my boyfriend and i have been coming to this place for a long time .
the sushi is very plain and not high quality either .
pretty awful entrees , sushi was n't bad and decent service .
i ordered the curry with rice noodles ; it was bland .
the flavor for the coconut curry was very bland .
terrible service , waiter was extremely rude .
do yourself a favor and do not eat here .
one of the worst restaurant experiences .
food was mediocre and the waiter should not be working in he service industry .
disgusting !
they had been our favorite for years .
every item of food was really unimpressive .
but it turned out to be a real bad experience .
even all other orders were very well below average .
my hibachi shrimp was very hard and tough as well .
the veggies were the only high spot .
the brown rice was mushy .
over _num_ % of the class failed the final .
do not waste your money .
they dont go over the math which is a big part of the test .
it does n't get any worse than this !
excuse me ?
it was clear all she cared about was bringing me to the cleaners .
i could go on for hours but it 's not worth it .
the food was to die for and the service was perfection .
however getting a quote and information from them was beyond frustrating !
i submitted a request online , a week went by and i heard nothing .
right off the bat she said `` no . ''
after a brief hold , she came back and said `` no . ''
i did n't find all of the staff to be overly professional .
nonetheless , filing taxes is a necessary evil .
this is the worst chinese restaurant that i have ever eaten at .
i went here because of the good reviews but was very disappointed .
just basic chinese food .
sadly , not the best place to go for a friendly staff .
: ( i 'll buy online before i go in here again .
the chicken parm sub i ordered was a hot bland mess .
not here .
the roll was cold like it was just pulled out of a bag .
not steamed or toasted and not soft .
also a few hours after i ate i got sick to my stomach .
but i am never going back again , and this is why .
i got stuck in terrible traffic and arrived minutes before closing time .
`` i 'm sorry , we close at six . ''
`` oh no , it 's after six ?
as i walked away , i looked at my phone .
i was turned away , despite the obviously urgent situation .
no note or sign for explanation .
unfortunate because i would have enjoyed trying it !
run , do not walk away from this place .
unless you do n't mind paying a fortune .
do n't trust them with anything you want to keep .
first and last time i will be going to jones dry cleaning .
do yourself a favor and go to quail dry cleaners next door .
after taking one bite i 'm less than satisfied .
it 's cold and completely unimpressive .
there are far too many better pizza places to indulge in .
this is not a review about papa johns in general .
terrible !
go to domino 's if this is your papa johns for your area .
inefficient and lazy .
this place is awful do n't trust them .
honestly , this is the worst food i 've ever purchased .
flavorless , undercooked , and late .
had to sign up just to inform others not to waste their money .
papa johns should be ashamed of themselves .
the person could n't get the information right .
was told it would be _num_ minutes for a small pizza and wings .
no stars and no more business from us !
the french fries are ok , i guess .
i wo n't be going back .
very slow `` servers '' .
the bald manager is not a very nice person also .
the parking lot is small , barely wide enough to get your care into .
when i questioned the cashier she did n't apologize or anything .
tipping should be up to the customer , not the cashier !
at this point i ca n't even get a return call .
not sure if this was fixed or not .
we also got the standard egg rolls and crab rangoon .
i mean , c'mon , it 's veggie lo mein !
the cherry special chicken , however , was pretty darn tasty .
overly sweet and not so appetizing .
good chinese takeout here , seems to be hard to find .
nothing to rave about , but not terrible either .
i was very disappointed .
i will be getting my chinese food elsewhere .
the coupon was spend _num_ , get _num_ off .
in any case , i was a little let down .
i 've had worse .
my cookie had no fortune .
it 's really like eating fired dough with cherry jelly stuff ... nasty .
and the beef with broccoli was worse !
on second though i think my cafeteria was better .
it was just so gross id rather have just ordered pizza .
seriously , do n't go here .
con : they ca n't get the online orders right .
i even asked for low salt , low sugar , and low msg .
con : they reheated the same food they 'd made earlier for me .
rice and the veggies i got were no problem .
but i was also delivered some super soggy crab rangoon .
con : i really do n't think i 'll be ordering from them again .
nothing to write home about and pretty expensive .
i was very disappointed in the food .
they were essentially fried wontons , not crab rangoon .
i will not be ordering from here again .
this place has really fallen off .
food was _num_ mins late .
everything was not in my order on delivery .
mongolian beef was filled with all onions ( for filler ) .
nothing but excuses from this place when called to ask .
delivery has gone downhill .
food was lukewarm at best by the time it arrived .
i was very disappointed with food here .
canned soda no refills .
would not recommend .
the health code rating has also fallen from a _num_ to a _num_ .
after _num_ years of ordering here i wonder if it is under new management .
it has gone downhill .
it 's the only place i order my chinese takeout from .
mine did n't show up in my delivery order .
neither was spicy at all .
very bland .
what i do n't like is they often forget to give you rice .
it was theory tasteless love me in i 've ever eaten .
boiled pasta would have had more flavor .
this would n't really bother me much if the food was better .
crystal clear and the music sounded like a million bucks coming out of it .
)
, the beers are cheap and cold .
anyway , we had to purchase more tickets at the door .
guess the best advice , just pay at door .
oh and last thing that should n't be over looked , the shower .
so you ask why _num_ stars , simple it was location location .
they 're out of bacon , yes bacon !
the ham was cold and salty and the turkey was like bad deli meat .
needless to say , i wo n't be returning .
my husband and i stayed here as a weekend get away to charlotte .
we would n't have been able to sleep in even if we wanted to .
the worst part was the water in the shower never got hot .
there is nothing worse than a lukewarm shower .
but my praise begins and ends there .
not even open on saturday mornings ?
terrible ) .
_num_ years of loyalty mean nothing if you are laid off .
some of the worst chinese take out i 've had in a long time .
the chicken was overly breaded and very soggy .
it was very cheap - but i guess you get what you pay for .
and followed up with `` why would n't you pay for this ? ''
crab rangoon was terrible .
also ordered beef & mixed vegetable , meh .
my first & second experience here were both the same -- horrible .
i was horrified - however did not know where else to go .
horrible service .
the worst pizza hut ever .
stayed on hold for _num_ mins trying to change an order .
customer service is awful i wo n't be eating here ever again !
i received no apologies or explanation as to why it took so long .
do not go to this one .
this pizza hut is quite possibly the worst service i have ever received .
what type of pizza could possibly take over two hours ?
this type of service is just completely unacceptable .
wrong pizza was delivered .
very rude .
this location has the worst service .
my entree , the scallops served with risotto , was fine but overpriced .
for $ _num_ i received three scallops on a bed of risotto .
was n't memorable , exciting or impressive .
i can not believe this place exists !
seriously , the youngest person there was in their early _num_ 's .
avoid at all costs !
we tried it again tonight for our anniversary dinner .
big mistake .
the descriptions were nice but the food did n't live up to it .
not worth the money .
why ca n't employees act kind to those who are dining in their home ?
very cold .
annoying .
so cold .
the ravioli app was cold and tasteless .
unfortunately we found it to be a bit of a miss .
when we walked in the restaurant decor seems dated , or perhaps just generic .
we split the chopped salad with gorgonzola .
i dunno - just not that great and i wo n't go back .
while everything was decent , nothing really came together .
skip this one .
interesting old house feel to the place .
i had to put some hot sauce on there just to get a kick .
the hot sauce bottles were empty and dirty .
this is not authentic cajun food !
this has got to be the most overrated restaurant in charlotte .
i 've been _num_ times and i have never been impressed .
but this last time was horrible .
every dish we had was completely flavorless .
fortunately it was only half price because of the groupon that i used .
maybe it 's because people have never had real cajun cuisine before .
the fried green tomatoes were blah .
the batter was n't tasty at all .
my entree was the combo etouffee with shrimp , chicken and crawfish .
the seasoning was weak .
the portions were good .
neither one of my two friends finished their plates .
i will not be going back .
parking was hard to find and it was loud inside .
but not a good group night .
i do not understand the hype about this place .
everything is incredibly overpriced and the food is less than mediocre .
i did enjoy the bbq shrimp app but the entrees were miserable .
thank god i only went bc i had a groupon .
this was our first visit to this restaurant .
however this dish ( cajun platter ) lacked any type of cajun spices .
gumbo was a bit watery and a pinch of salt would n't have hurt .
my fiance and i went to cajun queen one night as a date night .
i was not impressed by the food nor the ambiance .
the food was spicy not flavorful , just spicy .
needless , to say not a great experience .
i would n't return or recommend this place .
they lack favor in their food .
it was not good .
visiting charlotte from los angeles while husband is in town for business .
not the shrimp , the sauce with bread dipped in .
the bad : food is mediocre .
but it was bland and the rice seemed undercooked and flavorless .
the final insult : the grits .
so incredibly let down by this dining experience .
meanwhile , the food was terrible .
how does one mess up a cookie pie ?
do not waste your money !
it was n't awful , but it was n't anything special .
the seasoning certainly did not taste cajun to me .
( i got the crawfish creole and my girlfriend had the chicken etouffee . )
bottom line : i will not be going back .
very loud , bad service , and the food does n't met the expectations .
dirty plates were sitting in our table for a long time .
the owner could care less about customers .
nothing cajun about it .
they did not use our groupon correctly .
save your money and dine elsewhere .
i 'm not sure why this place is rated _num_ stars .
the food is barely ok .
the gumbo taste watered down and the service sucks to the 10th degree !
she came back _num_ min later .
do n't waste your time .
go to a better cajun restaurant , this one is not worth your money .
cajun queen was n't awful , but it was n't great either .
while not on par with new orleans , it 's not without charm .
still , not the big easy .
_num_ - new orleans .
very dissatisfied and disappointed .
will not go back .
went over year ago and was disappointed in the shrimp and grits .
this time , gave another shot and tried oysters and shrimp .
the side house salad we ordered for an additional $ _num_ was awful .
there were romaine core in the salad and one slice of cucumber .
the waiter was loud and annoying and our drinks ran out several times .
the past three times have been very disappointing !
either way i will not go back .
the staff is unfriendly and rude .
so of course , i refused it .
trying cajun yard dog next .
if that 's a bust , so much for cajun in charlotte .
a friendly restaurant employee is the exception to the rule at cajun queen .
watery gumbo started off our meals .
no one finished their meal .
only one person even bothered to take home their leftovers .
very bad service .
i will definitely not visit this place ever again .
maybe it was the awful dinner spot they put my husband and i at .
we were next to the kitchen and it was really loud .
my husband got the chicken shrimp diane .
when it came , it was mushy and had the consistency of baby food .
i 've never had pecan pie like this texture before .
this place is awful !
was with friends for a birthday and it was _num_ degrees outside that night .
the reservation was for _num_ and _num_ of us got there first .
at that point i was ready to leave .
the food was horrible and they included the tip without asking .
i was so mad .
i will never never never never never go back .
horrible customer service and horrible food .
i did n't eat it .
fried green tomatoes were good .
bbq shrimp were fine .
i 'll never return again .
reservations at 5:30 on a saturday and it was packed .
creole tasted like a can of crushed tomatoes .
it was just embarrassing to new orleans .
we ate there some time ago but they just threw three strikes for us .
i did n't even bother going on .
parking sucks .
downstairs tables are too close .
not a fan .
even the rolls sucked ; very dry and tasteless .
me and my spouse order the same thing every time .
i believe he is the manager and is n't the most friendly manger .
leadership in these places however are what make your business .
then change how you handle your customers .
i 'm constantly amazed by how rude the receptionists are .
i had high hopes for the quality but i was disappointed .
mac and cheese boring , bland , no flavor .
cake dry boring i dont believe it was home made .
i stopped by the chicken box to grab lunch today .
the real shame is that they obviously changed the fried chicken recipe .
does anyone know where the old managers went ?
this new chicken box cafe is terrible .
this is no longer the chicken box cafe .
old owners or new owners , it was n't very good .
the fried chicken was n't crispy or seasoned like before .
very disappointed .
it was empty when i arrived around _num_ pm .
_num_ minutes .
my mother , daughter and i went here last week .
waited _num_ minutes for rice and gravy and got a refund .
it was ready within seven minutes or so , not bad at all .
wow , how rude !
do n't go here you will get ripped off !
as i was walking in i noticed a sign stating estimates were $ _num_ .
apparently they do n't have a lot of confidence that their prices are competitive .
umm , are n't dealerships supposed to be the highest ?
i hate to admit this but this is not first accident .
oh and you have to put _num_ % upfront .
i 've never been treated like this .
do n't fall for it there 's too many options !
so , i went with a staple dish , vegetable lo mein .
too expensive .
was really rude when i followed up on one question .
their work is shoddy and inconsistent at best .
even after constant complaints , this company has continued to deliver sub-par service .
only if you are from chicago and you prepared it .
but it was a mixed rack ... .
mac & cheese : so , so .
two words ... ... keep driving !
i 'm dissatisfied !
they do n't keep fresh food out like they should for the drivers .
did n't trust the hygiene of it based on the rest of site .
this place is disgusting !
the bathrooms are horrible and the coffee stations are nasty .
if the bathrooms are bad i will never buy coffee or food .
worst pilot ever !
food came correctly and my iced coffee was bomb !
no , my sign was you just walking away , lol wow .
oh well , ca n't win them all i suppose .
the food is ok but the service is awful .
absolutely the worst service ( if you can call it that ) .
you just get in your car and drive .
we were like , whoa , where the heck did that come from .
that 's what ruined the racing experience . )
customer service was seriously lacking .
i just did n't feel welcomed .
i 'm barely decent on the track but geez .
hopefully i get a better experience next time .
this was possibly the worst experience i have ever had as a parent .
we went to have a snack and wait til the next round .
if i could give zero stars i would .
the `` move over '' sign is utterly ridiculous .
i have zero problem moving over in order to allow faster drivers to pass .
two of us were forced to go the next round .
on a positive note , saturday is half off on ladies night .
terrible customer service .
first of all , it is in a sketchy part of charlotte .
however , it was very deceiving because the customer service was not good .
little did i know , that race was starting in five minutes !
apparently , the adult races run every hour .
well , they could n't help me with that either .
i really did n't want come back here though .
if it was n't for the price , then i would not even bother .
furthermore , i would rather drive _num_ minutes more to concord to race there .
they should just say its a flat rate charge .
small station .
outdated for the volume of traffic handled .
we did n't move for an hour and a half .
`` could be _num_ .
i repeat , this is a station review !
that 's a problem for another review .
and it is ugly .
terrible train .
staff are totally rude .
no southern hospitality whatsoever .
if you take a train out of here , have someone drop you off .
besides the limited parking , i would not want to leave my car here .
not very professional .
so , two weeks roll around and we head out to noda .
she asks my husband to reschedule .
monday , no phone call all day .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
for my third tattoo , i decided i wanted to go to fu 's .
spent almost $ _num_ on a custom tattoo i found online that i wanted .
would not go back and would not recommend to anyone .
i wo n't go here ever again because of the poor service .
none to be had here !
please do not waste your time , gas or money .
really , not an apology or let me get the manager .
crappy hair dryer .
holes burned in comforter .
stayed one night in _num_ bedroom unit .
he slept on the sofa both nights .
for me , who was paying the bill ... not ok .
for being a hilton i was n't too impressed !
cold burger .
rude people overall .
i do not understand why this place gets any business at all .
both the cashier and the owner would not give me their names .
horrible place .
that 's sad .
no stars .
do n't waste your time or money .
i wish i could give a minus _num_ .
wrong !
he was the rudest , most ignorant employee i encountered in the entire airport .
only if you 're lucky though .
i did not have a great experience in this airport .
it 's tough to be a vegetarian in nc , i guess .
anywhere remotely healthy or yummy looking had an insane line .
the layout of clt is terrible .
i ca n't stand this airport .
the us air passenger service agents are complete jerks .
one of my least favorite airports .
honestly wish i could give it zero stars based on today ... ?
security is beyond the worst .
check in with the airline was smooth , thats about it .
i could n't help myself .
this is the worst airport layout ever .
this service should have included four star dining and drinks before hand .
to me , these are the airport 's only redeeming qualities .
tsa security is the worst .
no help , no smiles , to slow , do n't care .
no preferred line .
generally a dirty airport ( delta terminal ) .
go to a bathroom that 's not serviced by these greedy people .
clt needs improvements in the drop off and pick up areas .
there was a very angry woman who came running and yelled at everyone .
she made them all get back out of lines and walk to the end .
she then forced them to walk through each empty section of the line .
and if it is , it is the worst nightclub airport in the world .
please do yourself a favor and avoid this airport .
charlotte ... could suck less but there are some things they are doing ok .
some of the walkways seem narrow but that could be just me .
hate security here .
i 'm not sure which is the worse nightmare .
must have been standing there for at least _num_ minutes .
this airport has ridiculously long lines .
for some reason , i found this airport to be kind of depressing .
i 've only been here once , so i would n't know .
there are many dining and drinking options , and cool rocking chairs .
very outdated , and super crowded .
this airport is just kinda weird .
when i got through , i had to go through security again .
your free wi-fi is totally useless .
internet is free but outdated .
slow and hard to get on .
it will only get worse .
the two stars are bonus points , but it gets the basics wrong .
that 's a deal breaker for me .
security checks are here to stay , do something about it .
- tsa agents are often rude and overly aggressive .
- not enough airlines service charlotte or compete for its business .
- not enough direct flights in or out .
long term parking lot was way over crowded .
plus , the shuttle bus was way over crowded and hot .
i ended up driving back to the hertz lot and dropping off my car .
the rental buses are relatively quick but the guy that was driving -- suck !
the us airways terminal was packed as usual , i expect no less .
little did she know i know what the hell i 'm doing .
i 've only been traveling all of my life .
i get through security and notice the tight space of this terminal .
why do they have no tram ?
at other airports , the gates are in close proximity .
except all of them were yelling over each other .
so help me god , i do n't care .
i do n't feel bad .
for some reason i always have to connect between terminal e and terminal a .
i hate hate hate hate hate this airport , because i hate us air .
i get delayed every single time ... occasionally i get cancelled .
this airport could be better , but even the free wifi ca n't help .
not a terrible experience but not an amazing one .
i like lax as my favorite airport .
i did n't check in so i have never waited in line at tsa .
it restaurants are over prices for a state that ends in carolina .
and the seats are certainly not designed for sleeping .
we officially hate charlotte .
everyone who works in this airport is miserable .
so it has made us assume that everyone in charlotte must be as well .
every place i 've eaten here is horrible .
as usual , the moving walkways are n't working either .
the food options are spread out , expensive , and impersonal .
this airport is not the best .
worst airport ever .
it is not near the top of my favorites .
horrible .
worst us airport ever !
no i do n't want to pay you money for doing your job .
my final piece of advice , wear comfortable shoes and stay alert .
the trash cans i saw in the seating area were also overflowing .
overall the experience was unpleasant , i 've been to much better airports .
hate you .
i had trouble finding a seat since most had trash or were dirty .
what the hell ?
she can walk , but not fast , and not far .
and she does n't do stairs at all !
this is the most outdated and dingy major city airport i 've ever seen .
clt is begging for a major renovation !
the location , however , is stellar .
um , this airport sucks , okay ?
avoid at all costs .
i flew through here two times last week .
my problem here is that i expect better .
then , when i sit down , everything is a sticky mess .
not a fan at all .
worst airport in the area .
never come to clt on monday morning .
security lines are ridiculous .
i 'm not sure what their function is except to collect tips .
they do n't put toilet paper in the stalls .
they do n't clean urine off the toilet seats .
if you do n't leave a tip , then they are rude .
i 'm currently still sitting at the airport nearly _num_ hours later .
at this point i 'm tired of hearing that .
ridiculous planning if you ask me !
i arrived at charlotte _num_ minutes before my plane was supposed to leave .
we ran to the gate and there was no one there and no plane .
luckily there was _num_ more flight that night .
the absolute worst baggage handling times .
considering it 's such a big hub , it 's not all that .
_num_ .
crowded with narrow walkways .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
with the gates built so far apart and narrow walkways .
it takes me a full _num_ mins to move from gate to gate .
been close to missing my flights a lot of times .
this is not the airport for international connecting flights .
worst combination of southern efficiency and northern charm .
ridiculous !
blew my mind away , but than again i will never get people .
i am from chicago and the people there are nicer than they were here .
you lose three stars for these things .
poor food quality .
the guacamole tasted stale and had the wrong consistency .
this airport is having a terrible time with the parking solution right now .
they need to get this fix quickly .
poor planning .
poor traffic flow .
poor crowd control .
this airport is _num_ years behind other airports of similar size and volume .
you could probably walk it by then , twice .
no one seems to know what 's going on ?
nope not any better this time around .
worst baggage claim area i 've ever experienced .
terrible service !
very rude !
there is n't .
called several airlines they were unable to find anything .
stupid is not a good enough word to describe that suggestion .
been in three airports on our trip to north carolina .
in the meantime your connecting flight can be boarding .
terrible airport for a layover .
not to mention half the moving walkways were not working .
lots of places to spend money !
maybe ringing up pre packaged food is not for you .
your bad attitude and horrible service is part of the reason .
_num_ 1/2 star rating ?
)
its obnoxious , but it fits your airport well i guess .
all your outlets ... lol .
i am not that ugly ... i think .
huge waste of a layover .
the bathrooms are super outdated and small .
if you 're comparing it to any other modern airport it is substandard .
but it 's also dead .
by _num_ , almost nothing in the d terminal is open .
and the one sit down restaurant that is open has no outlets .
i personally feel awkward with bathroom attendants present as well .
unprofessional , lazy and making a bad name for the south .
i am not a fan .
this airport is not family friendly .
this is so frustrating !
avoid this airport .
after that no real food in the entire e concourse .
over crowded tiny gates with no place to sit or charge a phone .
any review that says this place is great seriously has not been anywhere .
that gets annoying .
painful getting in and out of here with the construction and insane traffic .
seating is far less plentiful than it should be .
`` some time are a little slower than others . ''
get your act together .
this is the worst airport i 've ever been to in my life .
no one assisted us or even apologized for the inconvenience .
i 've not spotted a tram if there is one here .
there were n't any toilet seat covers .
that was a first time that i 've noticed rocking chairs in an airport .
this is by far the worst airport ever .
just do n't eat here stay away avoid at all cost !
not enough sets and it 's like going back to the 80s .
flew through here going to paris .
it was a terrible experience .
full of rotten people .
not enough seats and it 's like going back to the 80s .
ugly nasty concourse e .
it 's out of date and feels like _num_ .
it 's pretty gross .
everything else is pretty bad .
that 's saying something considering i travel _num_ % of the year .
worst airport for food i have ever been in , especially on the morning .
tsa here is horrible .
not a fan of this airport .
i was shocked at the foul language coming from both of them .
this airport is kind of crappy and old in general .
i 'm glad i had to run through between flights .
however , arriving in clt is another story .
i hate this airport almost as much as i hate charlotte .
man , i hate this airport .
i ca n't believe this airport has three and a half stars .
i will pay more to not have to worry about that in other airports .
internet is very cheap and should be provided accordingly .
its not that expensive or difficult .
it is no longer .
i am considering switching airlines so i no longer have to connect through clt .
worst airport experience .
there 's no restaurant outside security except a starbucks .
oh wait this is charlotte nc , never mind .
worst airport i 've ever been through .
some of us would actually like to get home to our families .
ridiculous .
never connecting through charlotte again .
got to be one of the worst airport in the us .
total travel of what could be _num_ turned into almost _num_ hrs .
note to self to avoid this airport at all costs .
i 'm just now checking my luggage , and i have stuff missing .
i stopped at the local stores the whole time i 'm in nc .
ridiculous .
oh and the free wifi is horrible !
do n't be fooled .
very crowded , not a problem .
`` free wifi '' never works , not a big deal .
always so busy coming through here .
delayed flights all around and sharing seating with another gate is ridiculous .
had to watch my step or else i would 've stepped on someone .
only redeeming thing was bojangles .
the workers however suck balls .
it seems way too small for the volume of foot traffic moving through it .
_num_ tries , _num_ mins each time .
confusing terminal approach and rental car return area .
worst wifi of any airport !
there are no teams here .
it 's annoying .
there are no overhead signs warning you of this .
waste of time .
then i go to the bathroom and there are attendants looking for tips ?
horrible avoid the american terminal at all cost !
a small airport that needs some improvement .
the lines for security here are long .
there are n't many places to eat here .
not here .
wendy 's is one of the slim choices for food .
there are n't too many things to see or do here .
no interesting shops .
i 'm not a big fan of this airport .
customer service : disappointing .
it was torture .
restaurants : disappointing .
other than that , it 's just a bunch of chains .
i just do n't have good experiences here .
Neutral
security here is always a negative experience .
very strange and inappropriate comments coming out of one worker in particular .
it 's not our fault you work for the tsa and are miserable .
unfortunate .
really unfortunate .
unacceptable .
overly crowded .
often see people sitting on the floor at some gates .
the airport environment feels very rushed and stressful .
it is _num_ pm and the line is past the american check in counters .
there are only two lines in the inspection area and no one is moving .
went to the regular line and was through in less than _num_ minutes .
this has been a terrible experience .
i 'm a young african american woman on my way back to chicago .
every restaurant closed at 10pm on a friday night .
only thing open is starbucks .
ca n't stay in terminal .
american airlines did n't tell people that .
shame on you north carolina for encouraging a hostile environment .
i do n't want my money to go towards hate .
i 'm sick and disgusted with you !
i do n't see this at any other airports .
on average , _num_ minutes .
and while you 're waiting , tsa agents stand around chatting .
not once , have i had a reasonable answer to the hold up .
_num_ hour layover turned into _num_ and then finally a cancelled flight .
but this was going on long before i arrived at 5pm .
and weather was not a problem at that point .
the flight was leaving in _num_ minutes at this point .
i wish she would help everyone that ever needs help while traveling .
they did n't care that the flights were all delayed by _num_ hours .
okay no big deal .
he said all these drivers in charlotte suck at driving .
the last time i was here i was rushing between flights .
none of that stalls have sanitary pads for the toilet seats either .
this is a very poorly maintained airport but yet , somehow a major hub .
also , the flight was delayed ... how long ?
nah , just sit there and wait .
clt is one of american airlines hub and it 's extremely crowded .
no thanks clt .
furthermore , no one has returned any of my messages ... .
worst airport for baggage .
extremely slow for american on c terminal .
thanks for wasting _num_ minutes of my travel time .
the worst tsa experience !
next time i will avoid flying through this airport !
the tsa at this airport is the worst !
they really need a customer service training .
avoid this airport !
get rid of the mens room bathroom attendants !
quite possibly the worst airport i 've ever had a layover at .
that is where our connecting flight 's gate was located .
she did n't make my experience at this airport the best .
watch out for the angry lady with american airline where you check your bags .
this is a terrible airport .
crowded , no customer service at any of the businesses .
just an awful airport that needs to get back into the 19th century .
i 'm used to airports in cali where every seat has a charger .
long term parking at clt is dreadful .
avoid connecting through charlotte at all costs .
and i 've been to quite a few of those .
it 's a museum , not a zoo after all .
is that really too much to ask ?
anyway , i stood in line behind one other person to order my breakfast .
he then proceeded to get my coffee and fill my order .
thankfully , the bk employee continued to give me my cup of coffee .
do you really need _num_ bk employees standing around doing nothing ?
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
they said there are no tomatoes on that sandwich .
i said no , please , no tomatoes .
i get the sandwich , there are two tomatoes on there .
way too pricey for the chain .
avoid this place in the airport .
_num_ minutes to wait for a standard order is not acceptable .
epic fail bk , clean up your act .
too much to expect at a fast food joint .
horrible restaurant .
i know its fast food - but this place is bad .
no one that works there cares about food , service , or cleanliness .
it 's a pig bucket of bk .
i asked her for honey mustard , she didnt even hear me .
and no thanks or nothing .
not going back to this place .
you might get better service at the chilis too in the same airport .
the worst people i have seen in the business .
she is like you said no meat .
and her response was gold .
she said that they consider all the patty to be meat .
side order of buffalo chicken strips .
not a good choice for running between flights .
the item should be called buffalo soup with chicken strips .
avoid the buffalo chicken , just get the plain .
it 's probably a better level of ordinary .
i ordered a platter with no sausage as i dont eat meat .
they made me wait a long time and gave me a platter with sausage .
the order was $ _num_ for hash browns .
please do not eat there .
this is called no mayo .
couldnt give them zero stars .
that displeased me more than the disappointing food .
coffee is not that bad and it is convenient if nothing else .
Positive
the only negative was the lack of trays .
by far the worst restaurant in the airport .
this one is terrible .
food is poorly made , employees are rude , and service is slow .
the fries were good and the burger was as i ordered .
people would probably tell me that i 'm expecting too much .
i can not even with that .
would give it _num_ stars if i could .
shit hole !
too bad _num_ stars is not an option here .
the staff and management are rude and only want money .
save yourself the trouble and just flush your money down the toilet !
this place is so ghetto and trashy .
disgrace to the gay community !
do n't waste your time music out of date .
the combination kills it for you .
i was not impressed with her at all !
i had the spaghetti with italian sausage .
the sausage was piled on top the meat sauce in ground pile .
poor , poor presentation .
i tasted the pizza and the crust was undercooked and burnt on the edges .
obviously the oven was too hot .
i wo n't be back again .
unfortunately being a charlotte institution does not mean tasty food .
i 've had better , cheaper italian elsewhere in charlotte .
did n't really make anything i could n't make at home .
unfortunately , i was tremendously disappointed .
saying that this dinner was awful is an understatement .
terrible greasy smelly cheesy food .
and to top it off the woman at the register was very rude .
i grew up going to this place but will avoid it now .
the worst pizza i have had .
she just said , `` i 'm sorry you feel that way . ''
i had _num_ pieces of pepperoni on an entire large pizza .
it was around $ _num_ .
i called back and eventually he offered to refund my money .
terrible customer service from manager .
food was only ok , but good portions for the price .
our waitress was good , but the manager ruined any positive experience .
it was ridiculous .
the lasagna and spaghetti is very generic .
but sadly , they have lost the art of making great food .
the pizza was horrible !
not much more than a chunk of lettuce drenched in italian dressing .
chef ramsey , where are you when we need you ?
if you want good italian or greek food look elsewhere .
our food came out relatively quick , which was a plus for lunch service .
while my portion was sufficient , there was nothing spectacular about the lasagna .
this is your standard , old-school red sauce italian restaurant .
it 's neither good or bad , really .
not even cooked !
disgusting .
$ _num_ or so for $ _num_ worth of walmart ingredients .
no way you 're actually getting either of those meats in the dishes .
the owners should be ashamed .
there were _num_ slices of pepperoni on it .
the sauce is horrible and the service is n't much better .
i told my server that the pizza was n't good .
i could n't tell the difference .
went here with a coupon , otherwise would have definitely not been worth it .
greek salad was pretty good but nothing else really was .
service fast but not friendly .
would n't want to eat there again , especially at full price .
all i can say is yuk .
not the absolute best in charlotte ... but also not the absolute worst .
the salad is a simple bowl of iceberg lettuce .
my one must get here is the cheesy garlic bread .
they even have original menus as part of the decor .
they still use an antique register at the front check out counter .
this is by no means a must go to spot .
but if you 're in the neighborhood , stop by for a meal .
this place looks like it was frozen in _num_ .
this is not italian .
we could n't finish our meal .
sanitation rating _num_ ?
this was n't it .
for the entree , i had the eggplant parmigiana .
i ate as much of the eggplant and meat as i could dig out .
i 'll give it another _num_ months and try again .
the `` meat '' in my dish was some greasy lips and assholes .
needless to say , this was a mistake .
you are killing me !
and i could not have given less of a shit !
too bad the food is so bad .
i had a small side salad to start which the waiter described as greek .
for the pizza , ugh .
just bad .
frozen dough with chopped vegetables on it , little or no sauce .
tasteless is really the only way to describe it .
it 's really a shame because the location is so great .
food was horrible .
my daughter ordered a pizza that was a warmed up frozen pizza .
the decor is tired and old but cozy .
the food was horrible !
there was no lemon or anything fresh .
i told the server that the meat was dry , overcooked and old tasting .
she assured me that it was cooked earlier today and reheated when ordered .
the bread was cold and tasteless .
i will not be back .
the food is horrible .
i went to dinner with _num_ friends and we had a variety of food .
no one ate their entire meal .
no one took any left overs home .
i order an ice tea , it was horrible !
you ca n't mess up iced tea .
the bread was store brought italian bread from the grocery store .
the salad is bag salad from a grocery store with dressing on it .
a true waste of money .
i kindly sent it back .
i was overcharged by about $ _num_ but i did n't catch it .
so with tip a very disappointing mean cost me $ _num_ .
me and my wife went here for dinner tonight and the food was horrible !
_num_ ) the pasta was disgusting .
it is overpriced and not worth it .
i would n't even feed this food to my dog .
wow .
bank of america at it again with less than exceptional customer service .
will not recommend .
was n't very good at all ... .
taste like noodles , salt , and water .
not made with love .
im so sorry the owner died .
everytime we attempt to come here they are closed .
dirty and bug problems as well .
worst service .
customers are rude too .
our server just walked out .
like , just walked out .
no one comes from the back .
then , turns around and walks off .
no explanation .
all we ordered was a pasta , breadsticks and desert .
terrible .
avoid this place at all costs .
too many decent pizza places in charlotte to settle for this place .
would give it no stars if it would let me !
ordered from them only because they were open and delivered after 10pm .
should have taken the other reviews to heart as i had a similar experience !
no pizza , no call .
cold , and not exactly what i had ordered !
do n't patronize this place ... you 've been warned !
i get there and the place is chaotic .
i could n't even hear myself think .
very disappointing !
i originally ordered over the phone the delivery time was _num_ mins .
pitiful !
service sucked !
do n't think i 'll be back to that pizza hut .
the last time i finally got pizza delivered it took over _num_ hours .
the only explanation is piss poor management .
when the pizza finally arrived , it was almost doughy it was so undercooked !
every employee that works at this pizza hut needs to be fired .
when the police got there they made them refund my money !
almost _num_ hours to get a pizza delivered .
they could n't find the driver .
they argued and argued and refused to take responsibility for this .
horrible horrible service on the phone .
terrible customer service .
i got a flounder dinner there recently , asked for some extra tartar sauce .
they wanted to charge me _num_ cents for it .
food there is ok , nothing special .
not a big fan of this place .
very slow service !
the worst refill i have gotten in my life .
this guy looks like he did n't know what he was doing .
i have seen better and i ca n't say that i 've seen worse .
i would n't recommend this one if you 're in a rush .
there is a tv but it was n't on when i was here .
he sent it back _num_ times because they kept making it wrong .
bread , cheese , meat - that 's it .
every single time i go its dirty , every time .
tables , benches , whatever it is , dirty .
the food is usually below average and the workers barely speak english .
instead and skip this place .
the worst mcdonald 's i have ever experienced .
i honestly wish i can give this place no stars .
i 'll avoid this mcdonald 's at night .
they seem to have some of the slowest service too .
they 're cheap in the fries .
Neutral
unfortunately i found this mcdonald 's in need of a good cleaning .
no one smiled , and my coffee order was messed up .
but no one seemed happy or to be taking pride in their work .
so dirty i decided i could not eat here .
i 'll leave the odor to your imagination .
side note ... .
ppl w/ guns kill ppl .
no way would i ever go back .
i was looking to trade and was offered _num_ % of what i paid .
i then asked to see what they had in the price they offered me .
not much , even in the used section .
i just could n't buy anything there because it was all too bloody expensive !
use the internet or drive over to matthews and go to fire power .
a word of warning for customers here .
so they are charging you $ _num_ to make a phone call .
but wait , it gets worse .
the background check is only required for long guns .
the last person i 'll point out is , i think , larry .
just looking at , and holding to see if you like how it feels .
i really feel sorry for those who continue to buy from here .
i 've never been overly impressed with hyatt .
wish i could give less than _num_ star .
needless to say , i would not recommend them .
the photos they posted do not do this place justice .
avoid this place .
made a reservation thru priceline on the parking shuttle and got there around 1am .
was too tired to care at that point so we stayed .
but the room was smelly and dusty .
but i have expected my car to be broken into in the morning .
not that we would have used it , but the pool was closed .
she booked us here on the way to ohio .
there was a small fridge , flat screen but no desk .
beware , this place is crawling with bed bugs .
do not stay here .
_num_ march 1st this is the date i went .
i should have just stayed another hotel and paid out of pocket .
the hotel was dirty and noisy .
the room was gross and the shower was disgusting .
worst hotel i 've stayed at in years .
if i could , i would give them half a star .
so overall , not good .
for the whole experience though ... bad , bad , bad !
really , it was a fine place to stay for the ridiculously low rate .
definitely not staying there again .
but we drove a long way and needed a place to stay in charlotte .
we got into our room , gross and nasty .
i would not recommend staying !
if you did n't know where it was you 'd miss it .
dining area is sparse , basic tables and booths .
got the chicken parm sub as recommended by yelpers .
mine was a little dry but a decent sandwich .
still not sure i would order it again .
menu includes hot sandwiches , wraps , gyros , and salads .
very average , pita was a bit dry .
chicken was pretty good though .
fries were fried in old grease .
i ordered a western omelette that was just completely destroyed by imitation cheese .
they offered a lifetime warranty , so no future issue would be a problem .
this is why i chose them to begin with as stated about .
i really thought they were much better than this .
they offered a lifetime warranty , so no future issue would be a problem .
this is why i chose them to begin with as stated about .
they brought the wrong one again .
i guess i will now wait another _num_ weeks to get this problem solved .
i just want it right & this ordeal over !

this is why i chose them to begin with as stated about .
before i go on the owners and staff are all pretty awesome .
no complaints there .
bathrooms are by far the worst i 've ever seen for a public restroom .
there is no reason they ca n't be cleaned .
seriously folks , the bathrooms here are beyond nasty !
and points off for cutting out indoor smoking .
do n't get me wrong folks .
as a matter of fact it was all over the place .
they gave me a $ _num_ discount for bringing my own hair .
it was a waste of my money .
please do not go to this salon .
they will try and scam you for whatever they can .
just do n't go here especially if you have natural hair .
if you are looking for customer service , look elsewhere .
this place is a mess .
i immediately cancelled my appointment and called around .
what you are getting for that value is not the same .
the bed was comfortable and the room was mostly quiet .
one night , there was vacuuming upstairs at 1am .
tip : avoid the ground floor if you are concerned about security .
i do n't see why not but there are better .
ive stayed here about _num_ times over the past 4-5 years .
the entire place is dirty and tired .
the elevator was broken ( and had been for a month ) .
overall - do not ever stay here if you can avoid it .
the room looked , smelled , and flat out felt terrible to be in .
it was a smoking room - and i do n't smoke .
you 've been warned .
i wish i could give them zero stars .
this place is disgusting .
the room brought more cat urine scent .
two bugs greeted me as i entered my room .
no bugs yet .
i will not be using the shower in the morning .
however , the rooms were worn and in serious need of updating .
the carpets and sheets were dirty and heavily stained .
this was by far the worst hotel i 've ever stayed in .
we stayed here one night .
it was disgusting and filthy .
elevator was broken so we had a brief encounter with him at 6:00 am .
what i learned ... do n't trust the stars , read the reviews .
this is the worst place i 've ever stayed in my life .
there was no soup or anything kind of body was .
the staff was rude and poorly trained .
my picture sums up staying at this particular micro inn .
the stench of smoke is horrendous .
this is the linens i am gon na go with . ''
the worst i 've been at was a howard johnson 's n nj .
we could n't wait to leave .
found a _num_ star one _num_ minutes away for just about the same price .
i feel bad for those that fell for this .
horrible stay .
smelled like urine .
totally gross .
the toilet then for the next hour continued to run .
the outlets along the bed wall do n't work at all .
it just looks trashy .
not entirely sure what that 's about .
old couch with fake leather peeling off of it !
although it says it 's non-smoking , my room reeked of cigarette smoke !
do n't be fooled by the outside because the outside is n't too bad .
missed my flight and this was the cheapest option .
poor location and service .
that was my only option because of the missing flight .
they only good thing is the crowded airport van !
my husband left the car again to have the repair corrected .
terrible !
i 'm just now getting over this horrible stomach bug caused by his place .
needless to say , that price is ridiculous !
you will not be disappointed like you will here .
needless to say , i 'm never going back .
while waiting on the manager , the angry cashier would n't shut her mouth .
the chicken is n't as crispy and juicy as i remembered .
it 's chewy biscuit drenched in honey butter and served at room temperature .
not only has the quality dropped , the service is horrible .
somebody just does n't give a **** !
as for quality , my chicken was piping hot just out of the fryer .
obviously that did n't do anything so the problem continued .
this was all during my favorite song which really made me mad .
food was mediocre at best , place seems kind of dirty .
would n't recommend .
our group mostly ordered the prime rib and two had the blackened chicken pasta .
it was served with canned pineapple and was overwhelmingly sweet .
why not serve chocolate cake , cookies , mousse ?
the show was bad .
i would not pay full price , and i would not return .
from the moment you walk in they make you feel like your home .
chicken was grilled at some point ( grill marks ) and was very dry .
white rice was rice was fine .
i 'm sure i will be back as my coworkers visit this place frequently .
sadly , my dish was as flavorless as possible and rather oily .
not even good for an eight dollar lunch special .
went there _num_ weeks ago and it was horrible .
not sure what happened to this restaurant but it has seriously gone down hill .
so something weird to begin our visit ... .
i have never experienced that in any restaurant before .
needless to say this was not my favorite !
no wonder disney world is making a killing in this side of the woods !
first time , last time .
the chicken was chewy and dry .
the french fries were barely warm either .
the biscuit was even small and dense .
not at all like other bojangles i have visited .
this location made bland , flavorless chicken .
the crust was rubbery and stale even though the chicken was very hot .
they were not even that busy .
the service was n't good at all .
the manager was rude and not very accommodating .
my order has been consistently wrong here .
the service is rather poor .
this is the worst wendy 's i 've been too !
seems management does n't care either ... .
restrooms are always dirty at every visit i 've been there .
ok , normally i would not review a fast food restaurant .
i wish i was surprised but it was ice cold .
the bun was firm like it was quite old .
the cheese was hardly melted .
probably the slowest drive-thru i 've ever experienced .
the sandwich looks like someone sat on it .
i did n't get a damn tomato .
i was wrong .
how in the hell is the line always long when the food is trash ?
although i 'm not a burger person , theirs was pretty tasty .
con : they only accept cash .
what really turned me off about the place was the car hop .
the bill was $ _num_ .
i gave the car hop $ _num_ and told him to keep the change .
i gave him a _num_ % tip .
what did he want _num_ % ?
i 'll spend my hard earned money where the food and service are better .
my visit was on a saturday between noon and _num_ pm .
the place seemed pretty busy with about _num_ % of the stalls occupied .
odd , but probably the most efficient .
the slaw was also minced rather than being shredded .
the pork was moist and tender , but very bland .
there was no smoke flavor at all .
the slaw was crunchy and fresh , but it too was bland .
but the pork although being tender and moist was disappointing .
overall it was n't a bad meal , but it was n't good either .
showed up to the ghetto as expected , but the meal was underwhelming .
did it , wo n't do it again .
all hype .
he does not know everything .
nothing special about anything , imo .
not the worlds greatest bbq chicken ( sorry guy ) .
second price got soggy and the crust is only good when crisp .
bbq sauce was n't good at all .
dude - here 's a tip - do n't ask for a tip .
well , would i go back the next time i 'm in town .
the sauce was too vinegary for my taste .
everyone else in my party said the same thing .
here 's a tip , do n't ask for a tip .
haha , i was being totally sarcastic .
oh my word it was horrible !
not too good and not that much flavor for what chicken can have .
baked beans were from the can .
this place was not so good .
the bbq chicken was just ok .
this place was old and i will definitely not be going back .
complete failure the moment we arrived .
meat was too salty and the hush puppies were just ok , nothing good .
def wo n't be going back .
i do n't know maybe it was a bad night i went on .
not like super cheap but the menu has variety .
the food was homestyle , bland , and majority of plates are fried .
the bun was soggy and gooey .
my boyfriend seemed to like the chicken so i tried a small piece .
the fried outer portion was soft and soggy with their special sauce .
it came highly recommended so maybe i just had a fluke experience .
, but i let him come and do at least the outside work .
after another _num_ minutes on hold , i hung up .
so frustrated with at & t 's horrible service !
something as simple as this still has not happened .
first of all , if i could i would n't give them any stars !
like i 'm supposed to be comfortable with that .
she finds anything to charge you to get extra money out of you .
prepare for the worst when you move over there .
the wings came out wings , but lacked any sort of taste in it .
i guess it was cheap .
it came with _num_ rolls , but they only gave us _num_ .
however , this place does have burgers and other menu items .
no thanks .
rounded down to the next star for this _num_ star review .
the sitting area was a nice size and the kitchenette area was clean .
no problem right ?
i do n't have a nicer room that i can move you to .
not returning anytime soon .
stayed october _num_
absolutely worst customer service for a hotel ever !
we accepted the room , thanked her and went to our room .
worst hotel experience i 've ever had !
poor management and extremely poor customer service !
the hotel staff itself was n't very welcoming .
the housekeeping was n't any better .
it included a dish washer and a microwave , small fridge .
although the it includes a dish washer it does not include any dishes .
no spa area .
fitness room only includes cardio .
breakfast was n't anything to look forward to .
it is very isolated with not much within walking distance .
the location and staff gives off bad vibes .
will was our driver .
apparently everyone gets in the wrong shuttle all the time .
probably because he knew he was n't getting a tip .
it 's not an excuse to not do your job , period .
north carolina , this is n't looking good for you thus far .
very poor customer service in the contact lens department .
rude front desk staff .
will not go back .
this place was awful to me .
terrible .
i never asked for it and do n't know why it was done .
coming up on an hour wait , ugh !
billing sucks .
my appointment was at _num_ .
it 's now _num_ and i 'm still waiting .
i would not return based on the lack or respect for my time .
they scheduled me an appointment with a specialist two weeks out .
i 'm taking my business elsewhere .
concord nc location : do n't go there !
they have the worst customer service i have ever received in life .
i took my prescription to another vendor and had my glasses made .
i could not see anything .
waited for _num_ mins past appointment time .
no respect for patients time .
the guy does n't know what he is doing .
not `` how can we make it better for you ? ''
that , or she did n't care .
i 'm not sure which is worse .
i wo n't be back .
slow unfriendly service .
desert area of buffet was never stocked and was dirty .
this is the worst company for customer service we have ever encountered .
corporate has n't even tried to make things right .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
but recently getting really disgusting .
tables and chairs are always nasty .
nasty !
this is a five star mcdonalds so to speak .
her fries are cold as are the nuggets .
the sprite is all soda no syrup .
the food was horrible both times i ate there in the past two weeks !
rude rude rude .
the workers are just plain rude .
the fries were nasty and the bun on my burger was stale .
mcdonald 's is mcdonald 's there 's nothing really special to say .
quick cheap food with a tolerable customer service .
i even contacted the manager once to complain about my repeated horrible experience .
i never received anything and also never ate at this location again .
i ca n't stand bad customer service .
they are hire incompetent morons .
they are hire incompetent morons .
so , i decided to go with _num_ hotcakes .
extremely disappointed with this company .
i found a property online that i fell in love with .
i was not only disappointed , but frustrated and angry .
this is not the way to treat potential customers and just people in general .
rude and unprofessional !
not pleased at all with their professionalism .
for the inside dining experience , mcdonald 's beats burger king , hands down .
new , clean but horrible service .
waited _num_ minutes for two breakfast sandwiches .
however , the food is definitely meh .
fries were a little soggy .
breakfast gets a _num_ , dinner gets a _num_ .
this is n't the first time either .
horrible !
dry chicken , bland help , yay it 's southpark .
so she got me the street side tacos for me to munch on .
it was bland , nothing special at all .
but i suspect the rest of the food are blah too .
the same owner 's mimosa grill in uptown charlotte is much better .
really not much to say .
also $ _num_ beers of which i 've had about _num_ .
i will not be going back any time soon .
unfortunately , i found little to eat for lunch yesterday .
what a disappointment .
i have only been 2x 's within a year and was a little disappointed .
i just went for dinner and ordered the honey mustard glazed salmon .
it was ok but nothing special for $ _num_ .
probably would not go again .
sorry , the food was just horrible .
but with each experience , i am less impressed .
however , there are better places to dine within the southpark area .
the food is moderately priced , but is too much for what you get .
my last gripe with the restaurant is the limited menu .
this use to be the go to place because the food was always consistent .
flash forward to now , the tasty grilled portobello sandwich is gone .
what was left was less than 1/2 pound .
this place is as bland as they get .
the food was mediocre and the atmosphere was too .
i was so sad .
so in short the prices have gone up and the quality has gone down .
will not be going back .
our waitress was absolutely horrible .
to put it short , they should have just sent her home .
as for the food , it was bland , not much flavor .
this particular location is pretty hit or miss .
just is n't the same , maybe they sold ?
_num_ stars only because the service was good .
food sucked .
apparently a tuesday night is busy for the manager ( not the hostess ) .
tough and chewy , and the dull knife was not helping out .
the loaded baked potato was delicious .
i would n't bother to order it again .
and their garlic dressing is disgusting .
i do n't know why i continue to come here .
i dine here frequently and tonight was a real disappointment !
quality has went down as the price went up .
not worth going so much anymore .
that 's highly disgusting .
would never return if it was n't close and had to bring clients there .
i was very unimpressed .
soggy chips with a good steak .
i ordered the flat iron steak , which came smothered in a spicy sauce .
looks like we will stick with flying biscuit !
ca n't go wrong there .
if you like horseradish go for it , if not stay away .
i then chose the cheese and peppers omelette , with egg whites .
lindsay informed me they do n't offer egg whites , really ?
after ten minutes my waitress returned and informed me they could do egg whites .
so , i chose the omelette .
so , tonight we ordered two linguini and meatballs to go .
barely ate any of either serving .
we will probably be back , but only after the menu offers better fare .
pretty poor experience here .
not impressed .
nothing special and fairly expensive for what it was .
very forgettable .
the waiter was very young and a bit clueless .
the food was good but the shrimp and grits are not good .
that was _num_ mins ago !
is this your corporate policy or just an issue with your provider ?
avoid at all costs if possible .
the worst part is that this is the corporate store for the area .
she was very helpful and knowledgeable .
please avoid this place .
closes before _num_ pm and locked the doors as i walked up .
is it me or does the customer service suck ?
this place seems like the opposite .
the chicken salad is made with turkey .
there was 1/4 lb .
i do not want to eat a cheesesteak with a fork and knife .
i do n't like a sandwich with more mayo than meat , either .
i will not return to this place .
but i figured why not maybe they ordered the wrong thing .
so , i ordered the chicken cheesesteak , fries and some coleslaw .
this is not authentic if that is what you are looking for .
the cheesesteak was soggy .
not as crispy as others stated and they needed salt !
i did n't eat them all because they got cold and kind of gross .
how long should it take to make a grilled cheese ?
the paper tickets are so _num_ 's .
this is my 2nd visit and i am highly disappointed .
what i received was just turkey .
they are officially on the back end of my list of best delis .
the other 1/2 barely had more .
worst lunch experience of my life .
a little crowded but took an hour and came out wrong .
owners must suck every dime out of the business .
no empathy whatsoever about the situation .
staff is completely incompetent .
receptionist proceeded to tell me `` someone will call you when its ready . ''
( lie # _num_ ) .
( lie # _num_ ) .
no thanks .
folks , stay away from this place .
the patient is not seen as an equal partner .
after the 7th time being pushed away , i am taking my business elsewhere .
very hurt and upset with this business .
they could n't find any problem .
extremely poor service .
i 've filled tires 2x since so i asked them to check on tires .
no response to my concerns .
that , to me , says a lot about their skill level .
the apartments were great _num_ years ago , now not so much .
it 's been like this for the last _num_ months .
_num_ months later they still have not repaired my oven .
the leasing office is racist .
i would never recommend living here .
rude staff , shitty attitudes and unprofessional .
horrible .
it is christmas and i still do n't have it .
thanksgiving and christmas ruined by these jerks because i have no seating .
no help at all .
after two weeks i emailed again ( _num_ times ) and was ignored .
do not buy anything from this company if you live out of state .
it 's very dated and in need of remodeling .
there is only one small public restroom and no organization to the layout .
there is no security cameras in the parking lot .
then a few staffing changes , and things started going downhill .
things went from okay to a little worse to absolutely horrible .
yeah this place is horrible .
waste and pet waste all over .
the pool is never clean .
the hot tub does n't work .
it really just is a crap place to live .
lived there for almost _num_ years , at the very back if it matters .
my car was almost stolen once even with an alarm on it ?
if you ever have a problem you are seriously sol .
especially for a single lady i would seriously avoid .
one last thing , their maintenance guys are f ; in creepy !
i hated the fact these guys actually had a key to my apt .
and i 'd come home randomly and find them there for no apparent reason .
food tasted ok and was brought out really quick , hence the _num_ stars .
if my simple needs can not be met , then i become very disappointed .
this is where yelping has become my source of self help .
our mild salsa never arrived .
this was the first sign that it was going to be an interesting night .
no mild salsa , no rice ... ... why bother !
sure i will be back , but with lower expectations .
gross as it was , i understand that mistakes happen .
i was disappointed after reading all the positive reviews .
the chicken and beef had no seasoning that i could taste at all .
the refried beans was like sauce .
three of our five meals , the beef was n't cook completely .
the food did n't taste right .
needless to say , i am very disappointed .
nothing authentic about this place , will definitely not be going back !
i was overall unhappy with the service and the food at this establishment .
service was extremely grumpy .
absolutely no excuse for that !
there are far better mexican restaurants in charlotte .
frankly i do n't know how this one stays in business .
the food it 's self is nothing special or exceptional .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
what an awful experience i had with this salon .
she did not have a solution for the problem at hand .
needless to say some people do n't think outside the box .
is this a one person salon that can not resolve an problem like this ?
no response but she does call me _num_ mins later .
i told her i need a friday after _num_ any week .
she offers this friday at _num_ or 2pm .
that makes no sense .
she is a liar and unorganized .
horrible service !
i will tell everyone how horrible she is and how she is a liar !
get your story straight if you are gon na lie .
i have this place one star , because it ca n't get any lower .
very rude and unprofessional , let alone unnecessary .
what a waste of time .
unfortunately , it failed in less than one year .
it smelled and tasted awful .
to get home so that i could write it down .
i simply do not get a good feeling about practice !
looked past that and this week had terrible pain in my foot .
the park road office has terrible management and are very unprofessional .
i have never been treated so badly by a physicians office .
run , do n't walk , away from carmel family physicians !
their patient referral service is n't any better .
do n't go here - you will regret it .
horrible front desk service !
no letter , nothing !
do n't waste your time at this office .
this situation takes the icing of the cake though .
i can not get over how unprofessional and rude this office staff is !
Neutral
please pay attention to the negative reviews before you experience carmel family physicians .
maybe it 's just chinese places that stop serving ?
they lost my business for good .
i know i should have called beforehand .
i felt like this one waitress was very rude .
it was kind of shady business practice so i wo n't go back .
service : confused but trying to be helpful .
the chicken wings use to be one of the highlights of going here .
not anymore .
i read today in south charlotte weekly that they recieved a grade of _num_ .
customer service is lacking .
the waitresses said little to nothing ( which is the usual case ) .
really this place just needs to be more hospitable .
atmosphere is cluttered and tables are too close together for any privacy .
i am a sushi snob , and am extremely particular about my sushi .
it tasted like wasabi , but why the hell was it brown ?
we also ordered pan fried pork with kimchi .
the rolls come in pieces of _num_ , which i find weird .
i am typically used to larger rolls with _num_ or _num_ pieces .
we have not been back .
venue - the ambiance inside the restaurant is like being in japan .
sushi - the unagi ( eel ) was cooked perfectly .
they need better selections in sushi .
as for sushi , i would only come here once .
also , if you do n't tip enough .
arrived , party of _num_ on a wednesday night .
terrible service .
the sushi set i ordered was a typical americanized sushi affair .
not authentic at all .
i was very unimpressed .
neither were anything special .
the chicken teriyaki was nothing more than some boiled chicken smothered in teriyaki sauce .
was not good at all .
the sushi was mediocre at best .
never know sashimi can be this bad .
worst sashimi experience ever .
the table was also sticky and gross !
i was not impressed and will never go back !
none were busy .
none would make eye contact or acknowledge my presence .
i 'd suggest to check everything before you leave the store .
looks like very other cvs .
unfortunately i usually come here for the pharmacy .
they are so slow and are not any help .
the wait time to check out is absurd .
usually only one cashier is working and they are slow .
painfully slow .
in addition to being slow , the cashiers i have encountered are rude .
i sent in a photo order online ( same day prints ) .
it took this cvs at least _num_ days to process the order .
oh no , same lady still at the register .
i understand that everyone has bad days .
that does n't excuse poor service and a `` screw you '' attitude .
i drove around for _num_ minutes looking for this place .
am i missing something ?
and the gym was okay but nothing special .
do n't move here this place is horrible !
there is something always wrong with the apartment .
the worst apartment i 've ever lived in !
i 've only been here _num_ months and i 'm miserable .
if you are thinking of renting here do n't !
they have `` lost my security deposit '' !
lease has me listed in wrong apt .
the biggest thing is they lost the money !
run , do n't walk from this place !
biggest mistake i ever made !
yep , mandatory .
never have i heard of this being done elsewhere .
but why did they sign up for this contract in the first place ?
worst management ever .
of course nothing happened on monday .
no one seems to be communication for efficiency .
i 've lived in many apartments before and this one is the worst .
here is another review on alexander place- the management team is horrible !
all they want is your money !
$ _num_ snacks .
$ _num_ coffee .
medium cup of tomato soup : $ _num_ do n't expect a roll .
no , thank you .
the sandwich options were limited , and staff completely unhelpful .
have given this new spot several chances and it has disappointed each time .
service is spotty and knowledge of wine / training of servers has dropped significantly .
but , we wanted to try the tuscan beans so stayed .
needless to say i will never set foot in this place again .
i repeat this was a bottle listed on the menu not from the retail .
d & d is expensive .
however , the food quality simply does n't warrant the cost .
a piece of two layer cake , is over six dollars .
my husband and i come to the wine room often because we live nearby .
it turns out , she 's not even old enough to drink !
the young man behind the bar did n't look of age , either .
i ca n't believe it .
it pains me to write this review !
however , there is no excuse for such poor service .
bar was empty sans a handful of people .
almost appeared to be an inconvenience for her to wait on us .
i 'll be back to d & d but not to the wine room !
worst service ever .
sat outside for _num_ min with no service .
waitress showed up _num_ min later .
will not come back until they change entire staff , other than bartender .
what a horrible experience .
just opened them up an poured .
neither of what we wanted when i said sweet .
we were not going to buy anything else .
he also offered me a free lunch on the house which i turned down .
bill came to $ _num_ .
wine prices even higher than paris or london .
they only cost _num_ in paris and _num_ in the rest of the country .
anyway , if i lived here i doubt i 'd hang here much .
had we just stayed on the market side it would be fine .
she suggested we grab some wine and take it back into the market .
i had the shrimp and grits and it was ... not good .
the spaghetti and mussels were pretty good though .
i grew up going to the south park location .
hence why i needed the coffee .
it was obvious we were n't up to par with the wine room .
there were only three other tables in the restaurant .
no excuse for this .
so this should n't be happening .
i never told them about the cockroach because they did n't deserve to know .
overall myself and my friend were deeply disappointed in our visit .
dumb .
stupid .
they did n't even deserve a one star .
this company and leasing managers are racist and treat people like they are nothing .
the _num_ bedroom apartment we rented was a fucking dump when we moved in .
we gave a written notice to the leasing manager and a doctors letter .
no way will they get away with this .
bad decision .
i 'm terrified of those things .
she said oh , i do n't want to kill it .
terrible experience !
horrible place to live !
i can hear every ... single ... conversation that goes on in the hallway .
disturbing .
nothing had improved .
i now have roaches and my apartment has already been sprayed once .
i 'm beyond disgusted .
that is n't enough to make us love the place though .
dead roach on the bamboo on my steam dumpling basket .
perhaps the biggest disappointment was the egg drop soup .
it was very bland , and did n't taste like anything .
tasteless egg in water is definitely not something you want to keep eating .
gross , what happened ?
this last time there was pure disappointment .
each dish tasted like it had the same sauce as a base .
it was way too salty !
blah ... and i 'm sad that it was n't better .
i find the rice in any chinese buffet way much better !
when we walked in we were seated promptly in a nice section .
my daughter who picked it up had to leave .
i ended up eating crackers and peanut butter at home instead .
just awful !
my salmon was dry and flavorless with the filler rice .
i do not think i will go there again without a gift certificate .
too bad , i hope they change cooks .
this is a waste of time and money .
consider yourself warned .
but the food was not outstanding for the price or the ambiance .
it had no spice or bite at all .
the pepper steak was edible , but not delicious or memorable by any means .
it felt like a dish that had been reheated in the microwave .
i found out that portion size is good , then bad .
do not go there , they have no customer service !
years ago , this place was my favorite restaurant .
the service is incredibly slow .
apps were cold .
waiter was loud and too casual .
sea bass was steamed spinach coated in soy sauce .
this place could have gotten a better score but for the service .
they sent _num_ to a table of two .
not well designed .
wo n't be back .
it 's on the pricey side , but you probably know that already .
it takes money to keep the engine running .
what is really bad is the service .
well , that 's not entirely true .
but the wait for the food is absolutely ridiculous .
another bad experience two times in a row .
chang 's on tuesday night and have to say that is was terrible .
maybe i am spoiled but in every p.f .
here , however , i have received nothing .
i will not visit this restaurant anymore and can not recommend it .
at 1pm , with lots of open tables , they could n't seat me .
looks like they are having staffing problems .
so , today , zero stars , but overall two .
the service was not so great .
the waiter added another dollar to the tip i had already written .
he did n't deserve more than _num_ % .
we sat there for about _num_ minutes with soup spilled all over the table .
the menu changes are n't necessarily better .
my changs spare ribs were just northern style ribs with bbq sauce on them .
so salty i ate one and threw them out .
for almost $ _num_ we had a very disappointing dinner .
poor customer service .
tonight i wanted to grab a quick brew before a yelp event .
not so much .
no big deal .
too late dude .
worst mother 's day experience ever .
so it 's mother 's day and we did not have a reservation .
the wait time quote was an hour _num_ minutes .
they sat us in an hour _num_ minutes - not bad !
i expected to wait _num_ hours so technically they were early !
they had no high chairs so we had to wait .
_num_ minutes later our appetizers came out but no kids meal !
our meal did n't arrive to our table until _num_ 1/2 hours after ordering .
i kept bringing the _num_ month old outside to walk around .
the _num_ month old is not happy .
from now on , i 'll stick to take-out .
the whole staff especially our server were so unhappy saturday .
the food was so greasy and took _num_ min to come out .
she did n't seem to care at all either .
$ _num_ average a person for chinese does n't get you anything here now .
never again .
this was my second time here , and it was a disaster , again .
never have i had so much anxiety having a meal .
tried again today with my husband , nope .
the salad was nasty , iceberg with some dressing that tasted like onions .
i mean _num_ bucks is no big deal , but it 's extremely annoying .
very disappointing experience recently .
very poor experience no one accepts responsibility .
worst experience .
when did this place get expensive ?
small portions and pricey lunch .
had _num_ children with me and our lunch was $ _num_ .
not nice ... .
not nice ... .
yuck !
my wife and i went to pf changs tonight for dinner .
oh my gosh both of our dishes were horrible .
my wife got the honey glazed chicken and i got the sichuan beef .
the only tasty dish was our appetizer lettuce wrap .
even the stupid fortune cookies were stale .
caution to anyone having that craving for good upscale chinese food .
raspberry sauce is sitting out on my counter as i continue eating cake .
so disgusted !
called pf changs where the first `` manager '' sent me to another manager .
i love chocolate and that cake was $ _num_ ( tax ) .
taken _num_ tries to get order right and the server could care less .
i could not put another bite in my mouth .
it made me sick .
i have shopped at harris teeter park road for over _num_ years .
i have witnessed same manager return a cake only _num_ slices left .
returned with smiles and no hassle .
it is _num_ park rd harris teeter .
tried to buy about _num_ worth of groceries at self checkout .
refused to substitute as i see other customers do all the time !
_num_ employees confirmed no more waters in back .
still no fair and normal customer service offered to me ?
i do n't understand the hype for this place .
service was ok and my filet mignon was so overcooked and lacked flavor .
will not come back .
eh , went here on christmas for dinner .
wine was outrageously overpriced .
overcooked , tough and tasted like it had gone bad .
been there _num_ times .
not a big fan .
i was very , very disappointed in this place .
we ordered the burgers and they were dry & barely edible .
our waitress was also terrible .
slow and inattentive .
do n't waste your money .
this was n't my first choice , but sullivan 's was not available .
the choices were pumpkin or chocolate pecan pie .
i am disappointed that a high-end steakhouse does not have a pastry chef .
it is impossible get from a to b outside or inside the place .
we asked ... should we get out own menus ?
he then proceeded to chat with some waiter buddies in plain view .
i just could n't believe a _num_ oz .
so , we ordered the veal and chicken parm .
up to ~ $ _num_ ) .
honestly i 'm not sure what the big rave is about this place .
and for a steakhouse that was some lame steak .
desert choices were flourless chocolate cake and cheesecake .
thankfully it was n't my tab and i 'd never go back .
_num_ different family events and all _num_ were screwed up .
it was so burnt as to be charred .
it was turned into gray meat and cost almost _num_ dollars .
way overpriced and not worth the trip !
noisy , noisy bar !
if you want a great steakhouse , go to ruth 's chris .
it 's a shame but both of the things i had heard were correct .
it just was n't that good .
the steaks had no flavor and the lobster was overcooked .
the filet was also not very flavorful but better than the lobster .
i will not be back !
we ordered the humongous $ _num_ lobster and we should have known better .
lastly , we made our reservations through open table , which was honored .
just ca n't see it for the money .
not quite sure what the target market is for this place .
capital grille two weeks ago , my son , same thing .
not impressed with the food .
in fact , it is barely even memorable .
ok food , not too exceptional .
not to return , i am afraid .
velvet corn and chicken soup was tasty but needed lots of pepper .
ugh ... way overpriced , same taste as the food court at the mall .
no crab .
it would have been nice if they had told me this before i ordered .
the dumplings were just okay .
waited a long time to try this place .
however , the food was borderline bad .
the chicken portion was at least half vegetables , which was very disappointing .
the chicken itself was mediocre at best .
staff is rude .
the replacement order was poorly made and rushed .
i was highly disappointed .
the least she could have done was to put a credit on my account .
i immediately notified the staff and was told the manager would be notified .
this is the worst experience ever .
it is jessica fault !
give me a break !
this is the last time i visit this establishment .
the eggs i ordered scrambled and they were too dry for me .
unfortunately , a charlotte main stay has worn out the welcome pad .
the meals are over priced and just ok in terms of quality .
when my husband spoke to the manager , he could care less about it .
so , to anyone reading this , i would look for another breakfast option .
i do not get it .
why does this place get voted best breakfast ?
tried again today and were again sorely disappointed .
after going here for years , boy were we disappointed .
it 's like no one cared any more .
the manager could n't have cared less .
no refills on coffee , and the food was nowhere as good as previously .
it will be a long time before we consider another visit .
_num_ .
not so much here .
_num_ .
i 'm not going to finish it .
hell , i may not even last _num_ bites .
_num_ .
in addition to shitty service is the lack of service to begin with .
you ca n't eat pancakes with your hand .
_num_ .
speaking of coffee , their coffee is brutal .
then i realized they serve royal cup coffee .
this is the kind of coffee you serve to people you hate .
apparently , the management at oph hates their customers .
_num_ .
the joint seems to bring out a giant stack of stupid in people .
instead she could of said ok would you like something else instead .
she ended up sitting on my lap to eat .
it was an okay experience - sure was n't what i expected .
i was n't too impressed with my visit here .
the potatoes i ordered were extremely salty and had very little flavor .
pancakes and bacon horrible .
most recently , i went here on a sunday for brunch with my family .
the chicken sandwich i ordered was awful .
i just sat there for _num_ minutes while my party ate their food .
nice courts , but horrible communication about the courts being reserved .
the quality of the clothing was pathetic and most of the items were ugly .
the layout is terrible !
horrible customer service .
once again , horrible customer service !
what a complete waste of time .
terrible customer service at the cafe over the weekend .
also they had problems with their soda machine .
he never spoke to a single black customer .
the atmosphere is less friendly .
next time we want greek food , we 'll go to the mad greek .
a little more pricey but it caught my eye .
except maybe on small business saturday .
i have spent thousands of dollars at this store .
went a second time and did not have a great experience .
sat in a different seat and that seat did n't work as well .
pedicure turned out good , but manicure not so much .
i wo n't be going back .
can i rate less than a star ?
so we got up and walked out .
not fair to the customer at all .
i ended up with square shaped nails that were mediocre at best .
you can guarantee i will never step foot in this place again .
she did not apologize nor did she take me seriously .
the sales staff ( if you can call them that ) were complete snobs .
later i am still dealing with their screw ups .
ordered a very a very large and heavy coat rack .
we could not get it together because it did n't line up .
wow , were has customer service gone ?
walked in and no one never said hello .
good thing i was n't a secret shopper .
overly expensive attorney who will not deliver any results !
do not make the same mistake that i did !
i was in there _num_ minutes before anyone spoke with me .
an older man that works there stared at me and never spoke .
however , they will not get my money .
so let me go over this : i have a coupon .
i do n't have that coupon .
me - _num_ , her - _num_ .
_num_ of us that i know were sized wrong .
customer service was terrible .
after we purchased our suits they would not correct it .
highly recommend not buying a suit here .
these people do not know what they 're doing .
when we walked in , no one greeted us or even looked at us .
not helpful at all !
terrible experience !
the lady almost asked for the double price after doing the job .
she had to argue and explain but still end up paying $ _num_ extra .
would not recommend .
this place is below average when it comes to service & pizza 's .
disappointed every time i 've gone ... wo n't be trying it anymore !
what a disappointment .
the service was sooo slow .
we ordered two seafood entrees , two beers , and an order of sushi .
meeting our friends there for a sunday bite was nice .
that 's the only reason i 'm giving this place _num_ stars .
on top of that , none of the shrimp had been cleaned .
that 's beyond gross and completely unacceptable for a seafood restaurant of that caliber .
with all the other choices out there - we probably wo n't be back .
disappointing .
overly salted entree as well as very salty side of roasted mushrooms .
typical south side snob crap .
spicy tuna rolls were not fresh and smelled like fish .
california rolls lacked flavor and were quite bland .
i can not comment on the main courses as we did not have any .
gave the restaurant a second shot - equally disappointed .
while tasty , the portions are small .
unfortunately , the best part of this restaurant is the valet service .
bad decision .
bad service .
food was bland & ill prepared .
what a disappointment .
once our dinner came , everything went downhill .
for a place that seems so classy , the experience surely was not .
did n't feel respected as a customer .
never in my life have i seen someone charge that amount .
they had n't been cleaned properly .
this place is a total disappointment .
it was basically dried out , overly thin and the flavor was not good .
the food was very disappointing .
the goat cheese was nowhere to be found .
the french toast tapas was mediocre .
the egg on my wife 's eggs benedict was over-cooked .
returning to the buffet , my wife said the shrimp was very salty .
( i do n't eat shrimp . )
the desserts were absolutely pathetic .
most were stale .
to say that the dessert selection was uninspired is a severe understatement .
they should have been included in the price of the brunch .
we were not treated as we expected in such an establishment .
the food was not very good to my husband and i .
maybe we had a bad taste in our mouth already .
i went in to ship a package that i needed to return to amazon .
i left with my package and i wo n't be back .
what a terrible customer service !
unbelievably poor customer service .
next stop , the better business bureau .
the weights are limited and they do n't have a lot of machines .
_num_ weeks later i am still waiting on my other shirts .
this is completely unacceptable .
they refuse to do anything about it .
i was told that the equipment failure caused the delay .
i took them back and the cleaners cleaned them for free .
i spent an average of $ _num_ per month on cleaning .
he offered no solution for the shirt that his business ruined .
terrible business .
unfortunately the order was sent to flower hut .
i , like most people , do not answer `` unknown '' phone numbers .
the company was very unprofessional and rude .
i 'm completely disappointed , i ordered my mother-in-law flowers for her birthday .
it was a disaster , a horrible experience .
long story short , what was advertised online looked nothing like what we received .
would not recommend .
the lady that did my nails was so rude .
she never introduced herself or spoke to me the whole time .
the service was awful .
not going back .
nothing special to note about this location of the papa john 's chain .
much better pizza even if they do n't deliver .
this particular location has really let me down !
the breadsticks box had grease leaked all over .
both the pizza and the breadsticks are not the quality i used to .
very unhelpful service and pizzas always arrive 20-30 mins after time given on order .
poor experience at pick up .
highly disappointed all around .
i am in search of a new salon definitely !
Negative
if i could give negative stars , i would .
i waited for a while before i called back and there was no answer .
i 'm not kidding .
it gets worse .
she also spent the entire time trying to up sell me .
awful awful .
worst pedicure and gel manicure ever !
$ _num_ worth of services paid for and all of our services was rushed .
the place was clean and pleasant but the food was lacking .
it just wasnt enough food for the price .
service was okay , i 'm pretty sure he was the owner .
the rest of the experience was kind of bizarre .
there was also some take-out business at the same time .
here 's where things got a little weird .
this place was garbage for hookah .
they did n't even change the water and there was ash inside the hose .
i did not set out to write a bad review .
service : initially good
it was not worth the original _num_ dollars charged .
waitress : our food was served with rice and meat .
they charged us on the bill an additional _num_ dollars without telling us .
the deal is kind of fake to bring people here !
and the box for the food is _num_ $ .
let me tell you about the worst shopping experience i 've ever had .
she does n't even look at me , let alone speak to me .
i try calling out to her too , saying `` ms. ?
he is clearly as mad as i am .
somehow i feel like they have served chicken from the day before .
worst customer service .
not worth it .
this place is not that fast ... .
nothing special , basic run of the mill chinese food .
food is n't very good - service is worse .
crab rangoon is soggy .
egg rolls are greasy and flavorless .
this review is n't about the food as much as the service .
we ca n't wait till our lease is up !
do n't waste your time or money .
now my refrigerator is broken does n't keep anything cold but the freezer .
the apartments are n't terrible just not great .
however , i never like my food !
it is always greasy and flavorless .
very disappointed .
walgreens - at least this location - has gone downhill .
way downhill .
a little incompetence i can deal with .
has it come to reviewing fast food joints ?
yes , i wrote a letter , i 'm that guy .
anywho , it went a little something like this .
i stopped on the way to the theatre , to grab a bite .
that 's not good when you 're ordering food .
personal hygiene was n't on the menu that night !
i asked for my money back and left .
i 'm still never setting foot in there ever again .
big mistake .
the fries were soggy and cold .
the two dancers i did see where not all that great looking .
the bartenders appeared to be better looking then the two dancers .
i 'd rather get a lap dance from the bartenders .
i 've never been a big drinker ; over priced beer and soda .
this place really is n't worth the time or money .
well , it 's been better than it is now .
the last two pair did n't come out right .
however , they have let themselves go downhill .
the people are quite possibly the rudest i have ever met .
i have not met anyone there with a personality yet .
walk-in customers will be treated with less effort than existing customers .
it was too late .
a cut through the middle made it impossible to correct .
i requested a firm drive it out quote via email .
still no email quote .
i would stay away from these shady dealers .
the advertised prices were _num_ .
then they offered me the sale at _num_ which they claimed was their cost .
that did n't work so we took it back .
i found it online for just over $ _num_ and i replaced it myself .
that did n't fix it so we took it back again .
they are dishonest and their customer service is terrible .
it is n't that far but your experience will be so much better .
terrible sales staff .
oh , gee , they did n't realize that !
my trade was only worth about half of what carmax said it was ?
first off , i never right reviews unless it 's positive .
your brake pads & shoes have _num_ % left he said .
ca n't mess that up right ?
wrong .
the mechanic says basic .
and i said , my car requires a synthetic blend .
everything that should 've been done is handled miss .
i walked back in and asked the guy if my tires had been rotated .
comes back a minute later and asks for my keys .
i will not be returning to this location .
in addition , requesting potential customers to text you is not professional .
i 'll utilize another tour company during my next charlotte visit .
the rest was mediocre .
the rice was plain , edible with soy sauce .
but overall i wo n't be getting food here again .
smh worst service every ... .
ordered sesame chicken and it came with two pieces of broccoli .
so disgusting , i dont even want to eat my meal anymore .
the sesame chicken sucks .
their chicken wings are so tasteless .
they probably just fry it plain .
do n't waste your time here .
like i mean seriously drive past this place .
i gave this place _num_ visits and each time i was left disappointed .
i will never spend another penny there as long as i live .
the kitchen is in plain view of the customers which is nice .
the service was not very good .
the cashier was not very nice on the phone or in person .
the portions are large and the prices are very inexpensive .
i would recommend the lunch specials such as the hunan shrimp .
although if you are looking for spicy , i would order extra spicy .
my meal was marked as spicy and it was n't at all .
i would eat here again , but not anytime soon .
recently had my son 's 9th birthday party here .
just do n't expect much for a child 's party .
not a fan .
then the fried squash ... not crispy and just mush on the inside .
but ultimately it should be about the food should n't it ?
they even charge you $ _num_ for ice water !
the cole slaw i had was drenched in mayo , like water .
horrible !
my wife had a gyro that she said was just ok .
the only thing good were the french fries , which were hot .
avoid at all costs !
did n't even ask for my money back i was so disgusted .
lots of things were bad here .
this was n't during peak hours .
there were only two other customers in the entire restaurant .
the hamburger steak was ok .
the squash was flavorless .
the batter was crispy and the squash was soggy on the inside .
my bf said his shrimp was ok at best .
_num_ stars was being generous .
it was so dry that it was impossible to eat without liquid .
it turns out this was a terrible idea .
it was a very weird situation for us .
first off , it was gross .
i probably would have complained , but we decided instead to pay and leave .
they really have nothing here i ca n't get somewhere i like better .
right at _num_ , glasses were given out to a few tables around us .
the entire experience was fairly upsetting for being an avid fan of this place .
slow service .
horribly under staffed .
they were not busy , _num_ tables in the whole place .
very disappointed after reading the other reviews .
service was lacking and food came out wrong .
no offer to comp food and no apology .
would not recommend this restaurant to anyone !
however , the wait staff and food is below average .
our service was slow .
i 'm skeptical though .
meanwhile she neglected refills , messed up food orders , and forgot drink orders .
if you are going for food check the score before you walk in !
i was all ready to give this place a good review .
very poor experience .
lack of professionalism with the management staff .
we will not visit this location again .
the only flying you should be doing here is flying right past the place .
the place was not packed , and the servers were not busy at all .
i will not be back .
this location is no exception to that rule .
it is open _num_ hours .
a breakfast place that has been in the area a long time .
i went and the service was ok , nothing special .
the environment did n't seem the cleanest .
the food was very basic and a little greasy .
i would not go back for any reason .
( at this point , i was slightly annoyed ) .
from start to finish , this was a miserable experience .
i was scheduled to bring my car in but it would not start .
the actual body work seemed okay , i did n't closely inspect it .
this review is no different .
unacceptable .
so i ended up taking whatever she could find .
otherwise , i 'm switching to national or avis .
i wish we had video cameras to record the absurd service we received .
( which i did ) i waited for _num_ mins before the bus arrived .
if you hated your job that much just quit .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
pay the extra dollar or _num_ per day and stay away .
however , the people who run this location are entirely incompetent .
third problem : they gave us no inspection paperwork .
the manager said he could do nothing except give me a gift certificate .
fifth problem : i called and emailed customer service about my charge .
consider this your fair warning .
if i could give this company zero stars , i would .
_num_ words : unorganized chaos .
one of the worst rental experiences of my life .
waited over a hour for them to process _num_ rentals .
the line behind me very long and no concession was offered .
barely had enough power to go up a hill and still maintain highway speed .
next time it avis or anyone else beside hertz .
employees behind the counter would disappear for _num_ , _num_ minutes with no explanation .
_num_ minutes later , i was given a car in the gold parking area .
i 've never been treated so poorly .
avoid this place !
if i had known that i would n't have added the second driver .
this is clearly a rip off .
( they never responded to an email i sent shortly after the incident . )
but they 've lost my business for good .
do n't get scammed like i did .
avoid hertz and go with a reputable company instead .
what a lousy experience .
the car was nice , the service was terrible .
can i give zero stars ?
worst hertz location experience i have ever had .
the car i reserved was not in my gold space so i went inside .
i waited _num_ minutes for the right car .
he said no to free upgrade .
not a great hertz location and they need much better signage and training .
car was ok otherwise .
i am a gold member at hertz .
they did n't seem to care .
the worst hertz location i 've dealt with !
worst service ever !
even though we had a reservation we were made to wait for a car .
so no inspection upon return , guys ?
ugh .
they really need to change their system here .
car seats were dirty and old .
they have the worst customer service i have ever experienced .
never again will i rent from them .
do n't waste your money .
what a disaster -- so bad it hurts .
_num_ minute wait in line to exit the rental car location .
no cars .
no service .
takes terribly long although i am gold member .
name is not listed on the board .
it took _num_ min to get the car .
having worked in the rental business i knew she was n't telling the truth .
rent from somebody else if you have the choice .
bad service , bad cars , not recommended .
total failure .
avoid !
flights we 're canceled so i needed to drive _num_ hours home .
the attendants were in their small stations and would not scan my vehicle .
the line was barely moving !
_num_ minutes later i was able to return my vehicle .
on my first the front desk persons were slow , unfriendly and grumpy .
drove locally around charlotte for two days and used about 1/4 tank .
i was charged $ _num_ for a full tank and service .
three reps gave me codes that did not work .
horrible .
gave my family a car and the next day the battery was dead .
it takes forever to get the problem fixed and a new car .
horrible treatment .
the worst management team ever .
their vehicles are dirty and smelly .
word to the wise , choose another company if at all possible .
_num_ minute wait for a car i reserved a month ago ?
ridiculous .
never again will i rent from this hertz .
yet another hertz location that does n't have cars for reservations .
ridiculous wait as they make us sit here waiting for returns to come in .
i have probably rented from over a _num_ different hertz locations .
the shuttle driver just sits there and does not help in anyway .
so the super rude gold counter lady called over the supervisor .
i will never rent form this hertz again .
this is the busiest rental car place ive ever been at .
no darling it was not your rental car .
it was kind of confusing .
very , very slow service .
find another rental car service at charlotte airport .
lousy scratched up car .
this service really sucks .
reservations are not honored even if prepaid .
drop off was better than pick up , but that 's not saying much .
the worst service and slowest employees i 've ever seen .
i would give it zero stars if i could .
i showed up and had reserved a full size car .
not really what i would call a full size , but that 's fine .
the whole experience was terrible .
that was not ideal .
disaster !
hertz would not honor the reservation we had made over _num_ weeks ago .
so far ... not so good .
be a gold member so you do n't waste any more time .
the worst place to rent a car from !
must wait almost _num_ hours for a car and they do n't care !
most of the counter employees are rude or cold and not helpful .
quite possibly the slowest moving place on earth .
took over _num_ mins to get a car .
does n't this place know that every other rental place is more efficient ?
avoid this one if you can .
do not rent here .
do n't bother asking for management .
no , no , and no !
seriously i wished i would have wasted more time there .
maybe it 's just hertz .
_num_ degrees , line out the door , and no ac .
awful experience , do not rent here !
and i mean all day .
i even cut up my gold membership card already .
i was there on vacation and went to pick up my rental car .
i gave them my credit card and they said it was declined .
just to rent a car for _num_ hrs ?
he did not care one bit .
rented a car on the way back for $ _num_ bucks with budget .
no deposit .
the deposit i was aware of but the $ _num_ i was n't .
my mother had the same experience with the same _num_ companies .
why does it take almost _num_ minutes to get the paperwork .
the inventory was limited .
car was not in the spot .
will not use them again .
grab any car in the lane and drive away .
no soup for you !
unfortunately i can not give less than one .
after around half and hour , the transaction was finally completed .
avoid this disaster .
avoid this terrible hertz .
never again will i use hertz .
they tried to get me to upgrade twice .
this car was not safe , but were _num_ hours from charlotte by now .
so she agreed and said she would get back to me .
two hours later , i called and left another voice mail .
i 'm getting pissed now .
she could clearly see that there was something wrong with this car .
i certainly appreciated her making the adjustment , considering my aggravation and valid concerns .
horrible !
there were other customers of hertz with the same situation as well .
the worst .
they are always rude and i always have issues .
do n't bother .
i was never shown anything of told about the $ _num_ per day charge .
no body ever called me .
i spent _num_ minutes doing that and none had an economy car .
my plane was boarding at 5:30 so that would not work .
however , the car they gave me was complete garbage .
luckily i left myself enough time to just barely make it to my interview .
car did n't work .
_num_ others in same situation .
stay away from hertz .
take it from a five star gold member : avoid this location if possible .
after looking online , i 'm fairly certain that was just plain wrong .
the rental ended up being way more expensive than i had originally thought .
people were not kidding when they said hertz are terrible .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i drove for like _num_ miles .
did n't bring my refill receipts and got charged _num_ .
_num_ .
you are willing to piss off a client and make _num_ dollars .
_num_ .
i 'm going back to enterprise though i have no status with them .
_num_ .
the worse ever do n't use this place .
got through the rentals with no problem .
give me the keys and i 'll find the freaking car for you .
absurd .
another less than impressive showing by hertz .
slow an confused counter staff .
i guess they figured i 'd likely keep it for another week .
woman at gold counter said that they had no more cars in that size .
terrible service ... .
unbelievable .
i do n't hold it against the attendant .
wish hertz was more understanding .
no one came to inspect the car with us , which is frustrating .
the whole thing was frustrating to say the least .
look out for charges for options you did n't actually get .
horrible !
customer service sucks .
they were extremely rude and unprofessional .
just absolutely horrible .
i would give this place a minus _num_ stars if i could .
rented a car over a month ago for our flight into charlotte at 6pm .
none at all .
they put us on a wait list and said _num_ minutes .
it was _num_ hours !
they were not apologetic or anything .
the one lady who told us our car was ready was rude !
we waited another _num_ mins for another car .
worst experience of my life and nothing made it better .
i 'm sure no one at this location cares either !
my whole experience here was unbelievable .
when there were _num_ other counters that people could have been working .
that ridiculous !
why even reserve a car when they are n't going to have it ?
hertz ca n't even do what their whole company is about .
this whole this is just so ridiculous .
do n't come to hertz .
this hertz location is a complete toss up .
plus , the ratio of staff to customers is too low .
showed up in nc for a business meeting .
as soon as we got off the shuttle things turned unorganized .
do not book a rental car through national .
the worst i have ever experienced .
i normally book with enterprise , hertz , and avis .
the counter personnel assured my husband it was no problem to change the reservation .
then handed him the contract stating our daily rate was $ _num_ !
why on earth would anyone pay that kind of money ?
if you do n't like your job , quit .
score , but the hour we took to get there was not worth it .
never again , national .
ppl have been waiting _num_ minutes .
no other reason this facility will deserve anything less than _num_ stars .
no effort at all to help me out .
very disappointed !
i am also disabled and have a service animal .
agent : rude .
manager : rude .
horrible people .
enterprise .
the car did n't have any problem .
worse check-in system yet encountered in my travels .
will not go here again .
my wife and i did n't have the best of labor day week ends .
if we can not pay cash for something , we do not buy it .
no one else would help me .
`` i completely understand your frustration .
stay away from this group of companies .
was quoted $ _num_ and charged $ _num_ .
i 'll be trying hertz next time.
the first time i rented from this location the rep was not very polite .
this time , my car is not clean at all .
also , there is no way the car was washed .
i 'm sorry but that 's just not acceptable .
both the smell and sight were quite disgusting .
very bad customer service , extremely slow .
do n't waste your money or time here .
the absolute worst customer service .
i ordered a quarter pound they gave me a 1/3 pound .
the food was bad !
way too salty , cheese tasted like crap .
the service was pitiful !
the chips were all broken and stale .
skip it !
nothing special about it .
am not going back to this particular one for sure !
i was told by my party that the chicken was good in the enchilada .
the guacamole was tasteless and frozen , previously made .
nothing was authentic and nothing was fresh .
i was disappointed the second time .
not sure if i would go back .
this place is a joke at best .
the wait staff act as if their last job was at the dmv !
horrible service , less than friendly would be putting it mildly !
totally reminded me of a mexican soup nazi attitude !
the food was horrible not authentic mexican restaurant .
tried this place tonight after reading the reviews .
salsa was just okay .
and , they make their enchiladas with white cheese which is not authentic mexican .
staff was not friendly .
the food however was really dry , and not at all authentic .
i have never had anything like this , and there have been bad ones .
very disappointed !
this is not one of them .
hate to say it but i would rather eat at taco bell .
-the bathroom could use some soap and paper towels .
very annoyed with this place .
would have been almost enjoyable if there was service .
got my order wrong .
worst burritos ever .
terrible .
not as good as i used to come before .
i will not eat here again .
that would mostly considered as cheap customers .
i just need to look for another place for my favorite mexican food .
but overall , do n't bother with this hole-in-the-wall .
this is the worst mexican restaurant i have ever been to .
do n't go there ... ... run away !
stick with cold subs .
what we had was just okay -- but barely .
would 've taken _num_ min .
since we had to drive _num_ min with limited time not worth the wait .
imo this was very stupid & we 'll not be using them again .
i could go on forever .
gross , gross , gross !
then there was no elevators .
secondly , this place stinks and everything looks nasty !
the carpet feels so yucky but i did n't bring my flip flops .
the bathtub was extremely dirty .
when returning to bed , i discovered what appeared to be a bed bug .
no apology , no action thus far .
all cities are not the same .
this hotel is billed on-line as a _num_ star hotel .
the tv is outdated and old .
the number of channels is limited .
i recently stayed here through priceline .
i was pretty disappointed .
i felt terrible for this woman .
in particular , do not eat dinner in the depressing restaurant .
the airline put me up in this hotel for the night .
a/c unit was very loud .
for old looking sad food i did n't even want to eat .
there are a couple nicer options nearby that probably do n't cost much more .
this hotel is stuck in the middle of nowhere .
also , our damn room key would never work !
i had to walk up and down every time to get it to work again.
this place does n't deserve the business .
cleanliness is not a priority here .
hotwire is the reason for all my problems .
we stayed a week for a conference .
the bathrooms are a little small .
for the record ... its not worth $ _num_ .
if i was paying cash , i would take my business elsewhere .
toilet paper is cheap .
no microwave in room .
second night here the free wifi was not working .
the night staff were very helpful and friendly however the morning staff were not .
after _num_ minutes we get our drink orders taken .
i then start looking for a menu and there is none to be found .
eventually after another _num_ minutes we get menus .
then another _num_ minutes to order our food .
none of our drinks were refilled .
customer service goes a long way and the morning staff were lacking .
they 've got _num_ types to choose from .
parking was easy , but the lot was not well lit .
in my opinion , do your shopping elsewhere .
this is the first and only showmars i 've visited .
there are about _num_ of them in the charlotte area .
i could n't finish it .
the mac and cheese was okay , but oddly a bit bland .
both were completely flavorless .
the tzatziki sauce was okay same with the greek salad .
the food is marginal , and the menu is about _num_ % sandwiches .
sorry showmars .
i stopped by to pick up some dinner after i landed at airport .
i chose your fried steak with green and salad to go .
besides salad , i almost have to throw the rest away .
not to mention the price was about $ _num_ .
we will not be back to this location .
first , they got my order totally wrong .
very slow night only _num_ people there .
then when they arrived with my order , again wrong .
worst of all the food sucked .
it 's a slow night so i took them off the table .
you are open for another _num_ hours .
it gets worse but will leave this review as is .
still searching for a good chinese food place here in charlotte .
horrible customer service , i will never spend another dime in this dive !
we had to flag down another server to get our toast .
it was not good at all .
our food as well was stale , cold , and had zero flavor .
will not return here .
my hubby got sick off this food .
decided to come and give them another try no food on buffet .
it was not .
service sucked food was nasty as i dont know what .
imagine _num_ chinese food menus blowing through the parking lot , not cool .
i do not recommend .
do not recommend at all .
i will never go back to total bond .
communication is horrible !
since the old cards do n't work , payments have n't gone through twice .
there is never poop , pee , or vomit in our house or cars .
that has never happened in our household .
i will never go back to total bond .
told the test would be $ _num_ .
bad service , rude desk clerks , terrible management !
waiting outside our doors at _num_ am to get out when checkout is _num_ .
it was all very dated .
breakfast was free , but nothing special .
the worst hotel experience ever !
a paying customer that will never patronize your business again !
do not attend this college , i repeat do not attend this college .
fuck this place fuck this college , fuck the staff .
i was not impressed !
typical chicken place .
the only plus to the restaurant was the servers .
horribly slow service !
slowest drive thru in charlotte .
i 've been here numerous times with the same results .
slow slow slow and slow !
i 've stopped coming here cause they suck to no end .
the drive threw is always backed up like a clogged toilet .
the slowest and worst quality bojangles in the history of the franchise .
avoid at all costs .
this may be the worst mcdonalds in charlotte .
every time i go there they mess my order up .
was told it would be _num_ hours for a delivery .
took _num_ hours for one pizza to be delivered .
worst pizza hut experience ever .
if their drivers were the best , no one would ever move .
they would just sell all there stuff and buy new on the other end .
sell your furniture or pay anyone off the street before calling these guys .
i called them only to find out my truck had n't even left charlotte .
my move came _num_ days late .
Neutral
i hate to be negative .
but not good at all .
the worse i have had in a long time .
rice is reheated .
gross !
i order sesame chicken with shrimp fried rice and it was awful !
the chicken was extremely crispy .
the rice was flavorless .
i did n't finish my food .
i threw the entire box away .
how ironic !
and you do n't even deserve that !
the place was nearly empty , which might be a sign of changes .
the bbq was cold and dry .
it just was n't that good .
they may ask you where the food came from ?
my girlfriend ordered the fish along with fries and baked beans .
even after all of that , it still was n't very good .
i really like their fried chicken , coleslaw , potato salad and other dishes .
i 'm no barbeque expert but this food plain did n't taste good .
we drove a long drive to try this bbq .
the food came out cold and not fresh .
the server is clueless .
the ribs themselves are not good .
what saved them was the bbq sauce .
and thats why i 'm giving _num_ stars and not _num_ .
nothing special .
sauce again the thin eastern style .
yes , i am going to make a direct comparison between these two establishments .
_num_ .
and i did n't have as many side choices ?
_num_ .
it smells like an elderly persons home .
_num_ .
no bacon in the green beans ?
_num_ .
i 'm giving it a _num_ star for the food and price .
it literally tasted and looked like everything came out of a old can .
probably the worst bbq food i 've ever had .
i do n't know how else to put it .
but if you can avoid it , you should .
it was $ _num_ for a standard pulled pork plate with a drink .
seriously so bad .
you 're giving nc bbq a bad rep .
just was refused service because we had a large group .
not an option .
empty restaurant , and they would not let _num_ people sit and eat .
their policy is `` no teams '' .
the hostess politely said they have had teams cause problems .
none of these _num_ parents will ever return .
so i ca n't tell you how the food is .
just do n't walk in as a large group .
$ _num_ for a regular size barbecue plate and a ice water !
the place was empty .
i am not an expert but i did n't see the smoky color .
the biggest problem was that the meat was under cooked .
do n't waste your time .
poor service , screwed up orders .
i 'd suggest finding bbq elsewhere .
guy would n't stop talking to us .
food was mediocre .
he was very weird -- asked personal questions that were none of his business .
the coleslaw had too much mustard and was very tangy .
we will not be back .
been here many times due to its close my house .
everyone else is below average .
i 'm here now writing this review and the basketball game is on .
i really hate that !
she did n't smile .
the sandwich was n't good want be going back .
i also smell a rat .
please do n't burn the burgers .
ok maybe this was my first and last time at this waffle house .
the restrooms were disgusting , the food was great .
first off our server acted like she could care less .
the food has gone downhill as well .
they still have potential but i doubt i 'll be returning .
there were three in our party that waited for nearly _num_ minutes .
_num_ minutes .
horrible showers , but nice folks .
stopped here on the way to fort jackson .
i would n't recommend this place .
gross .
who the hell can sleep on a square like that besides a child !
it 's beyond ridiculous and not to mention annoying to try and sleep on .
blah , so much for sleeping inn at sleep inn .
not recommended and officially denied going forward .
i absolutely can not recommend strongly enough against this hotel .
i wish i 'd read these reviews before deciding to stay here .
this in no way makes up for the horrible stench of this place .
i feel dirty just being here .
b. i did not know the electrical outlet did not work .
c. incompetent `` maintenance '' personnel .
d. reception desk : lack of a sense of urgency plus no follow-up .
e. no apology or compensation .
he gave me a confirmation number and everything seemed fine .
i am totally appalled that this would happen .
avoid bad service and disappointment .
do n't waste your time .
overpriced low quality hibachi .
i however made the mistake of staying .
not worth the stomach ache i had the rest of the day .
needless to say , i will not be eating here again .
my boyfriend came with me to eat but was not eating .
it took _num_ minutes for my plate to come out .
take your money elsewhere .
have not been to this location in awhile .
i was very disappointed .
both of us ordered pancakes mine was regular pancakes and my husband was blueberry .
not good .
the little bubble in my head said what does she mean by that response .
did not look like the menu pic .
ca n't believe that they serve us that .
not a fan of this location .
the toast and hash browns were the only items cooked correctly .
overall horrible experience .
the staff is friendly but pushy when it comes to putting in your order .
the place looks really run down and the decor is very outdated .
i 'm never coming back to a denny 's .
if i could give zero stars then i would .
awful service , poor attitude , poor food quality .
_num_ people in lobby waiting while wait staff stand around .
_num_ plate of food for our party comes out while others wait .
cashier checks our card out before we can give tip .
glad i wo n't be coming to this location anymore .
i ordered an avocado chicken caesar salad .
i assumed i was covered for my next refill .
not impressed .
the service is terrible .
instead , i got nothing .
wrong again .
easily the worst cup of coffee i 've ever had .
the service was laughable , and i have zero desire to ever go back .
_num_ .
_num_ .
very frustrating overall .
horrible service .
terrible showroom from _num_ .
poor attitude by employee .
todd 's flowers on central ave is out of business .
in fact , the building where they once occupied has been torn down .
so i asked for two pints , nope , out of pints too .
not super bad service , but i 've certainly had better .
associate was indifferent to my presence the day i went in .
no greeting , no offer of assistance .
i will not purchase with this company .
i do not like this company .
headed to backyard pools the next time i need something pool related .
ordered my pizza tonight via website .
when order came , plain cheese pizza .
this is the worst pizza store in charlotte .
as the other reviewers noted the management is horrible and rude .
do n't waste your money .
this place is awful dont waste your money go somewhere else .
i only rated _num_ star because i could n't select a half or none .
placed a delivery order at 5:30 and was told _num_ minutes .
ruined our panthers football game !
never ordering from pizza hut again .
did n't expect much from pizza hut .
do n't waste your time here , try a local place instead !
avoid like the plague !
i could have saved _num_ % off the price of my food .
i ca n't rate it at zero stars ...
wish i could give this negative _num_ stars .
the girl disappeared and no worker came out for about _num_ min .
and why did you wait all that time to tell me ?
this place clearly had no care for customer service or business .
unbelievable that they 're still in business .
i should have stayed home and made pizza myself .
it has been _num_ .
bad service .
this is unfortunately the one that delivers to my house .
this location is the worst and has been for years .
i tried to get a delivery on _num_ separate occasions .
sigh ... never ordering from them again .
sadly , this is the only pizza hut near me .
often answers the orders totally lacks something .
so , yeah , thankfully there are plenty of other pizza places near by .
these guys has the seeds to call and leave a message to call back .
if it was about the pizza you were n't getting it back .
my shrimp dumplings were only ok , and frankly tasted previously frozen .
the highlight of the meal actually was dessert .
on the whole , a major disappointment .
i could n't hear the people at my own table it was so loud .
i have only been there once but probably wo n't go again .
spinach side was a little bitter .
manager never came back to tell us that all were reserved for others .
needless to say , we did not stay .
on my second visit here , i had a very unpleasant experience .
awful awful awful !
i have never experienced such rude nurses or doctor in my life .
if i could give zero stars i would .
i ended up leaving and going to cvs clinic instead .
staff was nice , pedicure was horrible .
it seriously looked like a little kid did it .
the music is horrible , but most sport bars have that trend .
stopped by tonight with a friend .
my friend 's beer had a due date of november _num_ .
i returned my beer and ordered a draft .
it 's wrong again .
the salads on the menu sound good but taste awful .
my husband did not care for his meal either .
he got buffalo tacos and the tortilla 's were not even warm .
went for lunch with family ( wife and _num_ young boys ) .
how can you mess up a hot dog ?
we probably wo n't be coming back to this location .
there were waitresses everywhere , and it seemed _num_ or _num_ managers .
the food was mediocre , except the salmon .
high prices , watered down drinks , impersonal management .
it was way better !
it 's like a bad applebee 's .
ps - hiring high school aged girls as `` hostesses '' is almost creepy .
then again - the place is creepy .
this location is n't consistent .
there is one lady that works at the drive thru that is so rude .
i ca n't stand it .
i 'm not a fan .
the associates are slow and rude .
i just felt like i was being questioned .
the food quality was garbage she undercooked the hash browns as well .
ordered _num_ burgers and a soda .
i have no one to blame but myself .
the service here is almost always terrible .
the employees , by and large , could care less about customer service .
none of the machines seemed to work properly at all .
the games that did give you tickets were cheap as hell .
shame on you !
your lucky to get a _num_ out of _num_ !
also , there were _num_ games that were not working .
this chuck e cheese had the rudest manager i have ever encountered .
this location was completely overcrowded and dirty .
it was also annoying to us since this place is not cheap .
they had soooo many birthday celebrations going on as well .
the employees were not kind or helpful .
we will not be back .
the service pretty much sucked .
as my son said their `` legendary sweet tea '' was n't very legendary .
it tasted old and not very sweet .
to top it off the place looked and smelled dirty .
pretty unacceptable considering that it was dead in there .
it was just a waste of $ _num_ because we could n't eat it .
they probably wo n't get my business again !
_num_ hours before close and i asked for the grilled chicken bites .
i almost left but just ordered fried chicken tenders and too salty fries .
this was probably the worst bojangles i 've ever been to .
sit down and the sandwich is overcooked to the point of being rubber .
visited two years ago and got chicken that was raw inside .
person behind counter was apathetic and did not seem surprised at all .
no apology , just want some different chicken ?
got my money back and left .
was n't even nice enough to bring them to me .
slowest drive thru in the whole world .
but typical for the entire bojangles chain .
terrible service .
sadly i havent got my food quicker than _num_ minutes at this location .
the employees seem nice and all but i have never seen service so slow .
drive thru too damn slow !
it 's not appealing at all and the eggs smell just like grease .
you people never fail to simply make an order correct !
this crap has happened at least _num_ times in a row !
this is the only bojangles i 've ever had a problem with .
this place is terrible !
next we were told to pull up , worst thing you can agree too .
there was already a car waiting .
of course , it was not what we wanted , the club .
this one is poorly run .
i had to wait _num_ min in the drive thru for a supreme combo .
i am done with second chances for this location and will not be returning .
her response , i 'm waiting on biscuits .
it was terrible , terrible service .
hands down the worst drive thru experience of my life .
we ordered a bbq sandwich with no coleslaw and a _num_ piece tender meal .
and it 's pretty gross inside .
the service was friendly and the beer is cold .
the chicken & rice soup was pretty bland .
a friend of mine had a philly cheesesteak that used ground beef .
food is a bit over priced and nothing to write home about .
i was uncomfortable the majority of the time i was there .
so , why did i only give them two stars ?
absolutely the worst bar i 've been to .
trashy , nasty and extremely rude staff .
i 've been here about _num_ other times through the year .
there 's plenty other spots with a lot friendlier staff in charlotte .
when we came back my best friends iphone was no longer on the table .
will not be returning .
there were _num_ people total sitting at the bar including our party .
she ( the employee ) left without paying her tab .
`` you know i 'm a good person ill pay you back . ''
and walked away .
weak drinks .
and rude staff .
no class at this place .
things sure went downhill after that !
and that is just annoying .
the bathrooms are still disgusting .
the interior was updated and looks a little cleaner but it 's nothing special .
the drinks are so weak it 's appalling .
it was n't overly crowded , but it was n't dead either .
i had to scream to someone a foot away from me to be heard .
what made it especially awkward - no one was breaking it down .
do n't try to pretend you 're something else .
plus side , our waitress ( kim ) was pretty awesome .
it was empty in there but service was still a little slow .
after a lengthy wait our food came out and mine was all wrong .
the gave me fried tenders and fries oops !
i said no fries and naked tenders means grilled .
so no i wo n't be going back .
i quickly changed my order to buffalo wings .
the sauce was mediocre and one wing ( boneless ) was actually just breading .
even with $ _num_ groupon for $ _num_ its still overpriced ... ... .
okay .
overall , not worth it .
same dcor which we like but a new menu .
no longer are available are the thai spring rolls with peanut sauce .
menu description is poor though .
i called a bit late and they only had _num_ pm open .
a little uncomfortable but no problem .
you could n't see the table there was so much food .
i was pissed !
i do n't care how good your food is .
oh wan fu , you were a big disappointment .
after that was taken , our food came out very quickly !
my husband and i have been going to wan fu for years .
the worst was yesterday at lunch , they mixed up our order .
they did not thank us when paying or leaving as they usually do .
it was very rude .
the kitchen was poorly managed and the staff was struggling to handle the demand .
they had no idea how long it would take .
the food was bland .
it was over cooked & the sauce was more soy like than smooth .
i have found a restaurant that i hate and is this one .
hate the atmosphere , so dark during the day .
the food is terrible .
thought i would give it another shot after a previous bad experience .
if you are only familiar with mall chinese maybe you would like this place .
ca n't say the same for the quality of the food .
either they do n't carry it or i could n't find it .
its downright awful and has been for awhile .
so bad i have walked out and i have seen others do the same .
however , the employees in the meat department are very rude .
however , i decided not to purchase it from this store .
if i acted the way these employees did , i would lose my job .
and on my third trip i made $ _num_ .
i immediately noticed that the store is dark and dated .
it was an awful experience .
i wasted my gas and my time .
and i 've never had to wait longer than _num_ minutes .
nothing overly nice , about the same as a yard sale , but pricier .
staff is rude & snotty with `` comments '' .
they have always have an excuse why they ca n't `` accept '' something .
i walked in _num_ girls stood behind the counter not one offered to help .
she told me it would be _num_ minutes .
when they paid for my stuff the girl pretty much threw my money down .
in regards to the polish change , it was a complete disaster .
the customer next to me asked three more times very nicely for the water .
very poor service and i was completely unimpressed .
`` kelly '' is rude .
needless to say i will not be going back .
total waste of money !
this place is empty .
apparently they do n't like business .
no way will i be back any time soon .
the line was endless and crowded .
my husband orders the calamari and i ordered the lobster bisque .
i was n't all that impressed with it .
it was so nasty , we did n't finish our salads .
my husband was very dissapointed in the steak and regretted eating it .
i ordered crme brulee and my husband had their almond basket with ice cream .
my husband had a little better luck with his than i did .
we get our bill and come to find out it 's $ _num_ .
we went here for restaurant week and it was yuck , just yuck .
i do n't know why i keep going back to this place .
when we first got in , there was nobody at the hostess station .
just ok ? ''
she said no , we got our check , and left .
my lasagna was a $ _num_ meal at best .
my wife said her 's was priced decently but had no flavor .
i was greeted by a friendly hostess and seated at a comfy booth .
the second bite was stringy steak .
overall it was n't a bad sandwich at all .
i was disgusted .
very disappointed .
oven was n't working so no pizzas available .
over priced for average , below average food .
not impressed .
the answer is try harder to find a source because they are out there .
the cauliflower was good but there spinach all i tasted was vinegar .
the fruit was n't ripe and over all the experience was just bad .
i am sure i will not be returning .
the biggest rip-off ever .
however , no matter what you will always find a bad store .
i ordered a combo they made a mistake and gave me the wrong sandwich .
i was on break i did not have time to go back that day .
therefore i addressed it the next day they refused to fix it .
bad customer service they just do not care at this location .
i do n't have to eat here , have n't been back since .
the doctor said it was nothing .
all the doctor could say was `` hmmm , that 's really weird '' .
i took my dog in got his medication , it cleared up immediately .
i agreed and scheduled the surgery for wednesday .
not a _num_ % credit .
but i will not take her someplace that runs a scam like this .
the staff is unorganized and it is incredibly difficult to reach a doctor .
i would not recommend anyone to take their pet to this facility .
i 'm only giving _num_ stars because the optometrist was fine .
last time i ordered contacts , the wrong prescription was sent home with me .
ok , but that is n't what i wanted to do .
she 's obnoxious .
unfortunately that is where the good news stops !
and they looked at me like i had _num_ heads .
she did not return my call , so i called again .
a rip off of you ask me .
this is the worst place i have ever lived in all my years !
i will be filing a bbb complaint as well against this terrible management company !
we also have a horrible neighbor problem .
didnt really seem like the cared either .
no one came to check the unit for mold .
they told me they wont give me the corporate number .
they ca n't seem to tell me anything .
i just want to be done with these apartments .
worst apartments ever .
i shrugged it off and called maintenance .
sure they took a few days and gave me light bulbs .
they did n't even fix it .
to this day it continues to peel off and it is disgusting .
the next issue is that these walls are paper thin .
i 'm sorry , what ?
do n't sign a lease with these jerks .
ultimately you will get screwed over .
literally the worst apartment complex .
_num_ weeks later and nothing has been done .
we 've requested work orders _num_ weeks ago and still nothing has been done .
horrible food .
the huge problem is the teppanyaki ... just awful .
i ate there over the christmas holidays .
- the chicken was so salty it was inedible .
only a _num_ year old could be comfortable eating here .
just crap .
- i did n't say anything because my relatives have friends who work there .
if not for this , i 'd have talked to the manager .
the food was awful and the presentation was worse .
it 's really gone downhill .
the quality of all there food simply was not there .
the japanese food here is nasty compare to other places in charlotte .
my to go meal ended up being $ _num_ bucks after taxes and tip .
the meat were tasteless and dry and so were the veggies !
they definately wo n't be getting my business again !
average japanese steakhouse experience .
staff was very friendly ( hostess , waitress and chef ) .
i wo n't be back .
well it 's not the place it use to be .
that stuff is nasty .
dude get over it and go make your ring of fire .
i had the fillet , scallops and shrimp .
the restaurant is run down , and not cleaned thoroughly .
that is not cool .
the place was shabby and the floor was filthy .
he could n't save the day , though .
i would not return , and i can not recommend .
i believe he is a sushi chef and certainly lacks management skills .
the service was n't bad , and the presentation was typical .
just nothing special .
first off , i sat in the sushi bar area .
i have not eaten in the dinner area yet .
i just know better sushi places .
they had a crappy and small sake selection and their cheapest bottle was _num_ .
also i had to get a new soy sauce bowl .
i was _num_ minutes late , no need to yell .
probably will only go back for take out .
but how does a japanese hibachi not know what an unagi roll is ?
so not worth it .
staff were not as attentive as other restaurants .
very pricey and they automatically add _num_ % gratuity with your bill .
we will never go back here sadly .
if you want an authentic hibachi experience , this is not the place .
good for kids , bad for people who appreciate good japanese food .
the restaurant was not busy so we should not have been so rushed .
it was very unprofessional .
horrible !
the entire staff was hispanic , not japanese .
i just expected a nicer meal for that kind of money .
i felt extremely uncomfortable there , and the buffet was not worth its price .
the naan bread was like a rubber sheet .
they never bothered to refill the bread basket .
the chicken curry was passable .
chicken tikka masala was below average .
the only thing they bothered to refill was water .
were somewhat disappointed ( probably due to higher expectations ) .
the overall experience seemed somewhat disappointing .
but starting 2-3 years ago the food went downhill .
Negative
bummer to need to post a negative review of a previous favorite .
probably one of the worst indian food i have ever had in usa .
went there for sunday buffet and the food was terrible .
serving is bad and avoid this restaurant .
one of the worst indian meals we have had in a long time .
- lamb kabobs - undercooked and falling apart .
no excuse .
a big f for this .
tasted bland for what is supposed to be a very flavorful dish .
one can understand , this is charlotte and thus not a indian food destination .
but the miss on simple kabobs clearly show a careless staff .
in my opinion , a waste of money .
service was average to bad .
food quality left a lot to be improved .
meat was not cooked properly and was very chewy .
overall i do n't recommend it and wo n't be going back at all .
our waiter was friendly , he came to refill our waters twice .
i was a bit disappointed in the selection .
i am a vegetarian , so i was already limited in my choices .
their food was extremely heavy and could only eat one full plate .
food has never made me feel that way .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
in my opinion , this is an americanized indian restaurant .
_num_ .
by the time i had some , it was cold , chewy and blah .
no spices or raisin and naan .
not satisfied !
_num_ .
worst indian food i have ever eat in us .
it was horrible .
the spread is average , quality of food and service unimpressive .
saw a huge roach on the wall .
no apologies or comment as we were paying the bill .
wish i could give it less .
ridiculous is how to best describe the buffets .
cold , bland and that 's even if you get to see some food .
only _num_ other _num_ person tables there .
i only wish i had taken a picture of the buffet to prove it .
do n't say i did n't tell you so .
anyway i 'm sure they will be closed soon .
i just came from lunch with coworkers here .
ordered the shrimp and mixed vegetables , was served the shrimp and broccoli .
probably all the same sauce anyway .
shrimp and broccoli both tasted like freezer .
and now i 'm craving fortune cookie .
i 'm so sad right now .
well everything was kinda disappointing .
no bueno , not for me .
next time ill pass .
from there , sadly , it began to go downhill .
also he asked me if i wanted a menu ... ... strange .
cold , hard and greasy .
panda 's den in north charlotte puts this place to shame .
the hostess told me that there were not three ladies sitting together .
i know they just walked in ahead of me .
first impression : the place is old and in need of some updates .
two people in our party ordered chicken broccoli with fried rice and egg rolls .
one person got white rice instead of fried rice as ordered .
the waitress did offer to get the fried rice .
it tasted very much like the brown sauce was burnt .
the egg rolls were overcooked and almost burnt .
i had eaten here before and it was much better in the past .
so they great wall is not so great .
maybe just have some soup for lunch .
sad to say i wo n't take friends here again .
horrible customer service !
she was waited on before us and no apology was given .
never have experienced anything like this before !
will not be going back to give them any of my money !
what great wall of china south serves is cheap , frozen egg rolls .
i wo n't be back .
absolutely horrible experience .
so we ate our apps and still no one .
had to wait forever for our check .
the crab rangoons were simply not crab rangoons .
there was no cream cheese flavor whatsoever .
i am not sure what they were , but not what i was expecting .
just disgusting .
no idea why this place was full .
many great chinese restaurants around , this is not one .
this place is bad !
the service is bad , the food is bad and the prices are high !
the only thing i enjoyed was the wonton soup !
such a waste of money and time.
worst chinese food ever !
no go .
the location , atmosphere , and service were all good so no complaints there .
the food however was not .
gone downhill .
service was awful .
when finally the entree arrived it was relatively without taste .
my husband and i went this past saturday for dinner .
because i usually judge a restaurant for being authentic if their own people go .
i was wrong .
the wait staff leaves a lot to be desired , the hosts are great .
okay the favorite shrimp was disgusting .
the sauce tasted old and i could n't even stomach to eat it .
have n't been there in about _num_ years and man has it changed .
the hot and sour soup is exactly that .
the place was n't too crowded for a lunch hour so that was nice .
i wo n't get another certificate for this restaurant .
mainly because the service was horrible .
which was n't deserved at all .
so yes i gave it a two star rating because of service .
and that 's not what we got .
no wonder they are on groupon !
nothing stood out about them whatsoever .
i 'm only writing this to save someone else from wasting money .
it was very soupy and did not have any noodles ?
the onion pancake was incredibly dry .
poor service and okay food .
nothing special to write about .
if they did n't have half price groupons , i would never eat here .
went back yesterday after passing over for several years .
used to be one of my favorite places .
will admit beverage glasses were kept full , but nor a single pleasant gesture .
again not a real problem just one part of the entire experience .
how can you mess up wonton soup and vegetable spring rolls .
the sesame chicken was terrible .
i had a groupon so i check this place out .
the rice was burnt and the beef and broccoli was very salty .
the next time i went was for a lunch on saturday .
and honestly there is nothing special here .
the service was lacking , the check was dropped off right after the food .
the place did seem busy , which i think is because of the groupon .
the food is seriously lacking .
my hot and sour soup was terrible in flavor .
the shrimp in my dish were the really small cheap shrimp .
it is essentially just fast food in a sit down restaurant .
there was not one thing that i would even recommend to anyone .
it was all so blah .
i had not seen it before but though it looked very quiet .
so i only ordered lunch .
first no spoon or soy sauce .
then the egg roll was soggy .
they did not even cook it fresh .
it was so bad .
the egg drop soup had no flavor either .
the manager said i can take _num_ % off of your bill !
thanks but no thanks !
i have not been back .
went to thai house on a thursday around 8pm .
i did n't see any shrimp , not even mini shrimp .
the pad thai was n't bad ... not great , but not bad .
i 'm not sure if i 'll go back to thai house .
to use up a groupon , we had dinner there last night .
my roast duck was a little misleading considering it was more fried than roasted .
the same or better is available elsewhere .
red curry was very thin , which should not be the case .
it should be thicker than what i ate .
beef pieces were small .
overall the portion to price ratio is poor .
_num_ .
duck curry was okay .
i would not recommend this item if same is prepared again .
_num_ .
fried shrimps were below average .
any household can prepare those at home without much efforts .
_num_ .
as an exception to other thai restaurants , attendant lady was courteous .
i would not recommend to visit second time .
i do n't pay such a high price for ambiance .
i 'm not a fan really .
so i decided to try thai house again as my craving was strong .
which that was the least of my worries but it was n't any good .
it 's supposed to have chicken , clear noodles , and mixed vegetables .
essentially for me , it 's like fast food quality .
_num_ for beef basil ?
skip this place .
it was a big disappointment !
the service here is horrible !
we never got asked if we needed anything else and received no water refill .
it was dried and crusty like its been sitting out for too long .
big disappointment on that dish .
i ate it just because i was hungry .
the decor in the restaurant was nice though .
perhaps the main chef was not working on the weekday night i was there .
not likely to try again though .
and my husbands roasted chicken was frozen in the inside but cooked through ?
i am _num_ months pregnant and ordered green curry for take out from here .
secondly , it was not that great .
it was mediocre curry at best .
so , goodbye $ _num_ curry .
i did n't save the leftovers .
i always keep my university thai house leftovers for a second meal .
my chicken pad thai tasted too sweet .
the noodles were overcooked and mushy .
the spring roll is slightly burnt and the chicken rubbery .
disappointing because we were looking for a good thai place in charlotte .
very little chicken in both the soup and the drunken noodle .
i 'm sad because this was my favorite thai restaurant .
Positive
i had a really negative experience ordering takeout from here .
the pad thai itself was really disappointing .
the noodles were so over-cooked that they were falling apart into tiny pieces .
i ate about a third of it and threw the rest away .
very bad service .
waited _num_ minutes for someone to take our order .
oh , and we did ask to order many times , but just ignored .
below average and i will not return .
like many successful restaurants this one too - tanks .
when all else fails this place was so reliable .
not anymore i guess .
i gave it a try and i was really disappointed .
it tasted exactly like watered down ketchup .
however , we had the papaya salad as an appetizer and that was great .
went tonight and ordered pad thai .
disgusting .
they have switched sauces , the usual peanut sauce was missing .
in its place was a watered down ketchup sauce .
we also ended up with _num_ waitresses .
not impressed , left hungry .
she was slow , rude , and incompetent .
i will not be back to this clinic again .
this is by far the worst .
never ... have my prescriptions ever been ready on time .
when i called in to let them know , they did n't even care .
i 'm actually sorry i ever even ate there .
terrible .
no wonder this place was empty on at _num_ in the evening .
needless to say , there are plenty if better options around .
the first time i got to the car and checked - it was wrong .
there was dead silence , i asked again and she hung up on me !
i had my reservations about stopping at this location tonight .
i will not be back !
you wo n't get what you order anyway , so go anywhere else .
because that was the rude person taking my order .
then i was confused .
this is the only chinese restaurant i like in charlotte .
u can find all the yummy food on the authentic menu .
my favorite is the beef noodle and the pig feet .
the owner is different now and the new menu sucks !
just like other yucky american chinese restaurant now !
tried a different chinese restaurant in the area and wish i did not .
got shrimp with mixed vegetables .
also got the teriyaki beef which was like shoe leather ( very tough ) .
will not be going back .
hot and sour soup was bland .
crispy noodles were stale .
my girlfriend is a vegetarian so one can imagine this ruined her dinner .
certainly will not return to quick wok .
i was very disappointed in the food here .
it sucks that this is the closest chinese restaurant in our area .
food is only fair - burger was pretty flavorless and dry .
the food is actually fairly mediocre .
i went here for a nostalgic feeling , but the food was shabby .
i will never use lowe 's for installation ever again .
now , a week later , i have lost all patience .
very poor service .
waited _num_ mins at the paint counter with no acknowledgement of my presence .
john at the paint counter could use some customer service training .
i am going to give up on lowes .
worst experience !
it was an overall bad experience here .
the service was slow and the food was tasteless .
i would probably not return here .
the wait was over _num_ minutes and the waiter was next to the worst .
if i wanted to i could buy this place .
today however i think was not a great experience .
the food was ok , but the service was lacking .
terrible !
just spent $ _num_ for two people at lunch .
cost was $ _num_ .
looked nothing like the picture .
wo n't be doing lunch here again .
our entrees arrived about _num_ minutes after the salad .
she had smoked wings with ranch dressing , they arrived with barbecue sauce .
it was over cooked and tasteless .
this time was n't so great .
daughter ordered classic burger with fries and our appetizer was the new fried pickles .
the pickles came out fast and were very hot .
finally the entrees come and low and behold my pasta is the regular way .
slowest server i have ever had .
i am so disappointed .
poor service , especially during slow times .
my stomach had turned at this point so i said `` no . ''
all the waitresses know me and stop by and talk .
avoid this place if you value your health !
the fries were horrible .
i stood there as she looked at a phone after helping another guest .
they were full except one table that the guests behind me quickly claimed .
she offered no further help and i offered no further business .
would 've been so simple to just acknowledge me and offer some service .
i 'm not even sure where to start .
horrible !
park _num_ cafe is under new management .
our order required _num_ ... so no that 's not ok .
well scratch the quick now .
as usual it was mediocre at best .
to be honest i was offended and just shook my head .
you used to be ok but now you just do n't care anymore .
you no longer deserve my business .
this was an awful experience .
it was cold had a horrible flavor a lot of fat on the chicken .
and to top it off there was n't even an egg roll .
bad food , horrible service .
place is garbage .
we waited a long time for our courses and forever for our check .
we would n't have tipped that much based on the above comments .
very busy place for rather mediocre food .
the salad dressing was okay , but missing something .
i ordered the teriyaki steak and it had zero teriyaki flavor .
the meat itself did not taste good .
it was n't spoiled tasting , more like a really cheap cut of meat .
i only ate about three bites .
it was very watery and bland : ( .
major disappointment as that stuff is the highlight of a hibachi visit !
the positives are that the staff were friendly and worked quickly .
i can not imagine complaints about portion size !
moderately busy , but seated right away .
wo n't be returning .
given this place too many opportunities and they constantly fail .
you can tell they use cheap steak and lobster .
the sauces are not good and they are constantly rushing you .
i literally had my soup and salad delivered within _num_ seconds of each other .
then the chef comes out to rush us .
the chef was entertaining but the food was n't very good .
large portions of noodles and vegetables .
i guess they want big portions to make up for poor quality .
does n't work .
that is just wrong .
it 's not very good .
did i mention the hostesses were rude ?
very disappointing .
too expensive for what you get .
a lot of veggies very little steak or chicken .
i felt like i had wasted my hard earned money .
the server and chef were very efficient and personable .
it did n't have a lot of flavor .
i feel like i wasted my hunger , time , and money .
wo n't go back .
salon has changed hands ( again ) and not for better .
why was n't i told that before i wasted _num_ minutes ?
( repeat , repeat .
so i left -- for good .
i had one of my worst dining experiences here ever .
i refused to eat while my companion 's ate .
this is the worst restaurant i have ever not eaten at in charlotte !
across the board , the dishes were flavorless .
could n't be further from the truth .
i was really disappointed in this place .
i had heard it was good , but the food was terrible .
it did n't even taste like pad thai .
no flavor .
i will not be coming back here .
we ordered delivery from them tonight and we are so disappointed !
curry fried rice was also bland , luckily we have sriracha at home .
again the curry fried rice is not authentic neither .
we will not order from this place again , sorry .
vegetarian lunch was bland .
it did n't get any better with salt .
the decor was outdated and looked drab .
the lighting was nonexistent , we were basically eating in the dark .
i was greatly disappointed when it arrived .
for $ _num_ i was expecting something not quite so gross .
i would n't recommend this restaurant .
this is the worst thai food i have ever had .
they have new and used books , all separated into their various sections .
the portions are pretty small , and sauces are bland .
other than that , i would not recommend .
a takeout place in a supermarket ?
no thanks .
sometimes you luck out with incredible stuff and other times , you miss out .
i 've never lucked out here .
it 's so crammed and so messy .
floor was sticky .
service was not in any rush .
so rude and painfully slow .
at the speaker i waited _num_ full minutes & said `` hello ? ''
as politely as i could .
they said that the meat was kind of tough and dry .
if you asked me if i 'd return , i 'd probably say no .
they have me a baked potato .
i also ordered _num_ breads with it and only received one .
she ended up paying $ _num_ .
what an insult .
worst customer experience of my life .
_num_ .
the amount of time to get service was completely unacceptable .
_num_ .
_num_ .
my husband was afraid to eat it in the fear of getting sick .
i used to really like outback in nj but i 'm in nc now .
it was dry and well done plus it was small for the price .
i denied the managers offer to send it back .
disappointing .
sad too i used to love outback .
it 's a real shame .
really disappointed .
the shrimp was just gross .
i order sirloin and grilled prawns .
the guy waiter was not much nicer .
he was rude and had no interest in serving us .
i have been going to this outback for _num_ years .
i will never visit this location again and will also write outback personally .
this outback is horrible .
extremely slow !
do n't go here unless you 've got _num_ hours to kill .
this is the absolute worst outback .
do not waste your time and money at this restaurant .
the print on the menu is tiny and the lights are dim .
it has cheese fries added to it .
what a shame !
i could 've said yellow for all she cared .
however , they were very shady at the end .
first off , a heads up .
however , i was n't overly impressed with the service .
this is the 2nd time visiting and 2nd time being disappointed .
the first time i went with a group of _num_ other friends .
the service was less than okay and food was mediocre , nothing really memorable .
went with a group of about _num_ - _num_ people on a thursday night .
the service was slow .
i think it was the worst mexican food i 've ever eaten .
even taco bell 's tacos were better tasting than this one .
the rice was dry and the salsa seemed to come right of the can .
i would not recommend uptown retreat .
i do n't like being lied to .
the real problem was the hair cut .
it was a disaster .
so my hair is lighter on the top and darker on the bottom .
my largest complaint is the cut it is awful !
he literally spent _num_ minutes cutting my hair if that .
i actually found this salon on yelp and am terribly disappointed .
i have never spent so much money to look this bad .
i can not recommend anyone doing business at uptown retreat salon .
i made a huge mistake .
but it makes me wan na go try caribou coffee .
not something i 'd regularly do .
the caribou associates know how to treat customers .
she offered no apology or solution .
this is the worst customer service i 've ever had at a starbucks .
wow , this thing is horrible .
they 're tasty and pretty cheap .
you 're better off buying a frozen pizza and cooking it your self .
another thing they need to drop are those chopped salads .
bottom line : _num_ for _num_ bucks !
still not worth it !
this version of dick 's does n't get me excited .
well there must have been a `` bank error `` they said .
i hate bank of america more than anything else in the world .
i made zero errors .
there was nothing left they could check .
i do n't get it .
i wish i had done the same .
but : concessions are a complete rip-off .
i usually know this , but jay talked me into it .
the restroom had no paper towels , and the trash cans were overflowing .
i feel like i 'm in the 80s at this movie theater .
i have n't been back here in years .
the food is mediocre at best .
the meat in both was slightly greasy and not particularly flavorful .
the rice was bland and slightly overcooked .
oh , and as for that `` cheap '' bit .
not the best mexican restaurant .
avoid if you can .
terrible .
the food is bland and boring .
do n't go here if you require food that has some kind of flavor .
the food is quite bland .
i ordered the veggie burrito with no cheese .
there was no seasoning , or none noticeable .
um ... no !
chips are obviously from bags .
salsa were runny and definitely not spicy .
the rice was bland .
overall , it was just disappointing !
i should have just eaten at qdoba which was nearby .
service was mediocre .
i used to like it alot .
terrible food , service always rushed .
i 've waited longer at taco bell , and had better tacos .
the food is greasy and tasteless .
tasted bland and watered down to me .
now , my street tacos on the other hand is a completely different story .
i could n't even eat them .
the items inside the taco were n't that great either .
there was lettuce and guac on the side .
the beans were beans , nothing special .
service is the reason why i will never give the food another chance .
i just do n't like being surprised when the ticket comes .
super long story short : sub-par food , worse service .
the food was pretty good , but service was pretty bad .
possibly the worst mexican food i 've ever had .
tacos were cold , soggy and tasted microwaved .
everything was severely overcooked and just plain bad in the ceviche .
my main course was n't much better .
this place has sadly become the worst mexican food place ever , for me .
my family visited the restaurant recently .
the manager was not only not nice but very unprofessional .
there was not even an attempt to right the wrong .
customer service was horrible .
the fajita chimichanga tasted like chinese food .
yet , he comes back with extra texas pete drenched on my wings .
she was n't helpful at all never asked how our food was .
it was so nasty my stomach hurt so bad afterwards .
i use to the this place but the management is horrible .
i go there often but my last three visit were terrible .
_num_ .
_num_ .
wasted time and time , no compensation .
_num_ .
found a manager to inform that we never received service or a bill .
no bill no nothing .
it 's sad that i have to leave one star !
so dissapointed ( as are neighbors of ours ) .
the quality of the food has gone way downhill as has the service .
the enchiladas were poorly made and for the most part tasteless .
we 're done with this poor excuse for a mexican restaurant .
delivered wrong pizza .
poor customer service .
being from louisiana , i 'm a huge smoothie king fan .
their general smoothie recipe is now _num_ % ice and _num_ % fruit juice .
it was $ _num_ after tax .
i wo n't give it just one star though .
there are some positives .
place is dirty .
will not go back .
do not waste your money !
it was just terrible .
the ice cream looked old , and after trying it , tasted like nothing .
it is also very expensive ( _num_ for a small ) .
above all , it was incredibly dirty in there !
both restrooms and the drinking fountain were out of order .
we will not be back .
ice cream is just ok imo and overpriced for the quality .
but this place deserves the _num_ stars .
there 's no health score posted and i believe that i know why .
maintenance takes weeks to fix things .
prices are n't great for what you 're getting .
would not recommend to a friend .
rip off apartment complex .
do not rent here .
i called the collection agency and they refuse to work with me .
the agency says that they do n't have that file either .
but we will not stand to be ripped off by you .
horrible place to live .
my air conditioning broke down a total of four times my stay here .
worst place to live !
they also run out of sweet tea a lot .
( the combo i usually get is _num_ cents less here . )
i was thrilled to go and get my oh so favorite breakfast bowl .
i really tried to like this place .
we tried the late night munchies deal and that was a disaster .
the only thing i liked from the box was the french fries .
worst italian food i have ever eaten .
no , thanks .
i could barely eat one .
it was dry and tasteless .
we also asked for extra ice and such , but our waitress never remembered .
when i was given my dish , it was a alfredo sauce .
i tried a little of the margherita pizza , and it was not good .
it was sooooo soggy on the bottom .
tried my coworkers penne vodka , and that was tasty !
terrible .
terrible terrible .
terrible terrible terrible .
food was bad .
bad idea .
the food 's presentation was awful .
i wish i could give it zero stars .
had the worst italian food ever ... ... .
pity as i like to support the local businesses .
marinara sauce over spaghetti was far too sweet .
italian sausage was bland at best .
wine selection was average and overpriced .
would not recommend .
horrible dinner .
very bland and veal was tough pasta and veal had no salt .
this place sucked .
we were there with six people and the entire meal was a disaster .
they ca n't make an authentic antipasto .
they ca n't cook pasta .
the place just sucked .
obviously frozen product , blah .
big disappointment was received .
usually will give a place at least two times but not in this case .
same exact job but also including a new hose cost me $ _num_ .
i know chains tend to be more expensive but this price difference was unreal .
do n't waste your time coming here .
he never gave me the full total .
he gave me a more reasonable price .
i advise everyone to stay away from this scam company .
they took to long ... bad customer service .
they charge alot to have such bad customer service .
never go back there again .
i did n't like there attitude an customer service .
they are there for the money not to reply cater to the customer .
it does n't matter how hard i slam this place .
no one that works there can do anything about it .
how can i describe my experience here ?
their chips and salsa is bad .
the shrimp tasted like ... nothing .
even the cocktail sauce was bad .
do i deserve this ?
i mean ... shrimp from chilis ?
for the price , the food was awful .
truly awful .
the managers do n't care the server do n't care .
there were dirty plates and cups everywhere .
very gross .
suggest going elsewhere unless you have plenty of time to waste .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i really did n't care for the breakfast steak biscuits .
the meat patty was coated and then deep fried .
it was impossible to tell what type of meat it was .
it was like oil on oil .
the biscuit itself was ok .
but i would not go there for breakfast .
i 'm not entirely sure what the fuss about bojangles is .
quite frankly , i was a bit sad .
it was literally a piece of sadly breaded chicken on a sad biscuit .
1st it reeks of cigarettes .
the food selection is basically wings , burgers and pizza .
i 'll keep this one short - do not go here !
to me , that basically means that he has no idea what is wrong .
i 'm glad i did n't fill the prescription .
same practice same reason double the amount .
i do n't get it .
since then , the service level has always been horrible in this store .
food lion missed the boat big time with this decision .
i want to know what fool made this decision .
gross .
i would n't be surprised to see it close .
but this restaurant was not clean .
the floors had trash all over them .
there was dust around the windows and possible old ketchup .
i wo n't come back to this location .
service is poor especially for pick up orders .
never had a problem calling in orders at any other showmars .
i actually had to salt it because it was a little bland .
no ... .
there 's a $ _num_ ( ? )
deposit on the room that should be refunded in about a week .
but it 's not old , either .
terribly , terribly thin .
do not stay here .
false alarm .
the service manager is not an individual i feel that i can trust !
are you kidding me ?
worst part is my vehicle afterward still had a problem !
you do not pay hundreds of dollars for less than perfect service .
dealing with the service advisor at this dealership is useless .
also , think about buying the warranty on used cars .
avoid this place at all costs .
by all that is holy , do not stay here .
good thing my husband was there , because that was rough .
kind of a dingy version of the walgreen 's chain of drug stores .
finally , being open 24/7 is a plus at least .
i do n't know why i come here .
there is nothing to set this place apart from , ugh , walmart .
the worst walgreens in the history of walgreens .
very slow service with employees who seem to hate their jobs .
this walgreens is dreadful to go to .
_num_ hour later i came back and waited _num_ min again .
i switched drug stores immediately after this experience .
horrible customer service .
they move super slow and were n't helpful at all .
the old location would usually be moderately busy .
but not like it is now .
every time i visit this starbucks , it is completely slammed .
i can never find a seat and no one ever leaves .
they are usually friendly though .
i just dont know what it is .
if it was n't for that i would give another star .
i would not go back because i did n't feel welcomed at all .
my boyfriend and i booked a room on the executive floor for new years .
very lackluster .
recently renovated but my room was not completed and ac did not function properly .
no , he would n't have .
this is not the place to stay for a weekend get away .
i complained to our banquet captain at least _num_ times about the noise level .
and they still seem to give our guest the wrong food .
i am extremely disappointed with the way things went at our event !
ok , i just ate a science project .
check-in at the hilton university place was a breeze .
unfortunately , that is about where the good ended .
that would be an elevator that took about _num_ minutes to arrive .
the restaurant was completely empty .
after almost _num_ minutes , the food arrived .
i sent back the flatbread .
she was more than gracious and apologetic .
we paid and left , completely unsatisfied with the meal .
_num_ minutes later , she arrived .
in summary , i would expect so much more from a hilton property .
this level of noise makes sleep difficult .
this is obviously not a child friendly establishment and we were not welcome there .
as for the food , it was just okay .
the bagels were chewy and my son could hardly tear his with his teeth .
never insult someone 's children .
i walked into the store looking for yellow flowers .
i saw _num_ women chatting in the work area and another near the counter .
not one of them acknowledged my presence for at least _num_ minutes .
very short and not paying attention to me .
i am appalled by the lack of customer service and rude interaction i received .
called trying to get info to put together some arrangements .
only then are you informed how long the wait will be .
obviously this is insane .
slow .
not much else to say .
they also keep soap in a locked display .
this is a sketchy location and i do n't feel safe here .
especially how long you have to wait in this questionable environment .
this makes no sense .
always slow .
wo n't even let you float on your back .
there are better and worse y 's for sure .
the only thing i ever have to wait on are the free weights .
its close , so this is where i go .
my family of _num_ is staying here while our house is being worked on .
so far i have witnessed _num_ drug deals in the parking lot .
will not stay here again !
i love hampton hotels more than anything but this was a terrible experience .
surly staff that was never at the desk .
thank goodness i was staying on the first floor with my disabled mother .
run away from this property as quickly as possible !
made a reservation in june for july .
the clerk made and error and made the reservations for june .
we went to a wedding only to find the hotel had no room .
they did nothing for us , not even an apology .
this property has gotten very tired .
the place was not even that busy .
but the service was bad .
bad service gets the same .
at the same time , this chain is past its prime .
sorry , but this site may disappoint .
this place is horrible and has crappy service .
they might have to teach their cooks how to cook a steak .
not a good sign if you ca n't cook steaks at the right temperature .
yep , that loud .
this was quite honestly my worst experience ever at a tgi fridays .
this time , it went bad .
the chicken was soggy , and tasteless .
it was a disaster on date night , and very disappointing .
i did n't think it was going to be as bad as i experienced .
five people could n't see an opened table clearly behind them ?
i feel that i probably wo n't be going back to this location again .
the only reason i went here was for a book club meeting .
i 've been here several times and the food is very sub-par .
did n't much like the steak , and the fries were terrible .
the service was slow .
then i ate there and was reminded .
they were suppose to be baby backs but they were dry .
eating there made me realize why i never actually go eat there .
poor service !
when i called him out , he proceeded to get loud and walked away !
i am calling the gm !
the worst i have had on the road .
had the absolute worst dinner experience tonight at tgi fridays on harris blvd .
service was questionable .
steak overdone , rice dry and overdone , poor service .
very disappointing birthday dinner for my son .
this place sucks so hard .
have n't seen this much worse service in an american restaurant .
tonight was horrible !
we were seated immediately , however our server was not a good one .
he then brought the checks and did n't add the cakes in .
i did n't put it in .
it tasted and smelled like fish .
it looked like it was under cooked .
i ordered the chicken sandwich which tasted much better .
the bun came out soggy and the sandwich did not hold very well together .
it was not good .
he was unapologetic , rude and a condescending .
zero stars for me .
they literally messed up on every single person at the tables order .
the visit i made on my birthday jan _num_ , was the absolute worst .
this after they brought her the absolute wrong order .
then it was loud , due to people , and the bartenders .
horrible service .
horrible horrible horrible .
it took _num_ minutes to get drinks !
not even a glass of water .
horrible .
i really think our waitress forgot to put our order in .
the service here sucks .
the place was out of control .
not a sign of management .
this place needs a severe cleaning job from top to bottom .
tables were n't clean .
the gentlemen at the front in the host position were terribly unprofessional .
i got an apple martini and it did not taste like apple at all .
i will not be back ever !
if you 're white , do n't bother .
service is extremely slow .
endless apps were over _num_ mins apart from the kitchen .
poor quality service and professionalism across the board .
i consider myself a very patient person however , this was completely ridiculous .
they need a complete overhaul of management and employees .
worst service i have ever experienced .
server was simply lousy .
with all the other poor reviews why has this place not improved ?
sanitation grade _num_ .
do n't recommend .
my husband & i , went here for lunch .
the menu was alot different than the last time we was at applebees . ]
we was disappointed of the food and service .
bad service & terrible food , do n't recommend .
the food is really bad .
i should also mention that the salads were served warm along with lukewarm dressing .
despite the good food the customer service has turned me away from this restaurant .
very bad service .
also my girlfriend got very sick after eating here .
also notice that the chicken she had ate was undercooked .
customer service has been awful and i would not return .
she barely came to the table to check on us .
she never once refilled our waters .
it was a crowded mess .
he said , `` thanks for the feedback , '' then he left .
the food itself was eh .
it was bad .
we ordered two caesar salads , and she brought two house salads .
place was n't busy at all .
if you are looking for a quick lunch do n't go here .
this literally is the worst restaurant i 've been to my entire life .
wrong .
waitress delivered our water and drinks then nothing further for about ten minutes .
not very customer service oriented .
i would not recommend this place to my worst enemy .
i highly doubt we will be returning to this restaurant .
if i could give this particular applebee 's _num_ stars i would .
we 've been there several times and each time we left disappointed .
no biggie because it happens from time to time .
she was totally inept .
she could n't even get our drink order right .
i pointed out the mistake and she apologized and took it back .
it must have been _num_ - _num_ minutes before it came .
she never even gave us silverware or napkins .
we managed to flag down another waitress and asked for silverware and napkins .
she went to go get them and never returned .
we finished the meal , paid , and left without tipping .
no one goes to applebees because they want outstanding food .
walked into the smallest waiting area i 've ever seen in a sit-down establishment .
_num_ couples ahead of me and my wife ... wait time is 10-15 minutes .
_num_ minutes go by and none of the couples before us have been seated .
needless to say , we walked out .
this place has permanently lost my patronage .
first off the management here sucks ass !
the server did all that she could but damn !
worst service i have ever had .
when we said something there was one excuse after another !
it 's soup and a wedge salad .
no bacon and barely any toppings .
i knew my one experience wednesday night was too good to be true .
we still stayed because i insisted on applebee 's .
do n't waste your time .
some overpriced crackers , nuts , or pretzels .
i 'm not coming back until she 's either quit or fired !
they were very rude about it .
some of the worst customer service we 've ever encountered .
verizon is going to lose customers for this .
do not go to this location .
terrible `` hostess '' experience .
woman at the front had a terrible attitude as soon as i walked on .
i 'm continued to be so disappointed by the `` hostess '' .
they really act like you 're an inconvenience .
really disappointed .
terrible service , lead by tim .
ca n't you pay someone to update that crap ?
awesome place if you like your hair looking like you are _num_ years old .
disappointing .
my name was the next one not marked off .
i wo n't be back .
big mistake coming here .
will never return , even if my hair does grow back .
Negative
nancy was very unprofessional and rude .
i got there just to try the new triple steak sandwich .
it was a really bad experience .
i am not sure how appropriate is to talk to a customer like this .
avoid !
terrible wait times at night .
staff appears confused regularly .
i gave this location multiple chances .
avoid !
if you stand near the soda fountain area it will smell like sewage .
i had to get up and find my waitress myself .
on top of that the food was very salty and greasy .
i had _num_ pancakes and they were hard and the syrup was cold .
one pancake i couldnt actually bite into .
i would not come back .
i am glad our meeting is changing either way i will not be returning .
this place is the worst !
the orange juice did n't taste like real juice .
wrong !
the food was old and somewhat cold .
we ordered burgers and it was awful .
have n't gone back since .
our first mistake was that we came too close to closing time .
the manager jackie was extremely rude !
they even gave me a hard time about making a new order .
worst customer service ever !
horrible .
the food was flavorless and the chicken was n't cooked all the way .
there were n't many choices at the bar .
to make matters worse , i got sick later that night from the food .
do n't do it because they give you the worst rooms .
i 'm allergic to smoke .
no refund .
never going back to a sleep inn again .
so we decide to go last evening and man were we disappointed .
the most disappointing aspect of our visit was the smoked beef brisket .
there was so much fat , and it was fairly tough .
having read the reviews , i knew to stay away from the brisket .
i went with a `` lunch '' sized portion of sliced smoked turkey breast .
it was dry and not much more than warm .
no , i do n't think so .
and it was n't even tender !
am i asking for too much ?
food was not good .
service was not good .
do n't waste a meal here .
he started off by saying `` just _num_ '' .
as though _num_ people was not enough .
horrible .
really horrible .
their screen setup could be awesome , except they are n't hd .
do n't waste your time !
the local coworkers were n't fans of it either .
_num_ people ordered wine , and the first _num_ got it in wine glasses .
no bueno .
i didnt taste any alcohol .
not consistent .
i ordered the _num_ item platter , as i wanted a taste of everything .
)
the sausage was disgusting , and not spicy at all .
lastly , their bathroom reeks of urine .
let me say , this place is not somewhere to eat .
it 's a drinking place .
wrong .
this was a bad experience from the start .
the salad was good , the ribs were as tough as leather .
the service was horrible .
then _num_ out of _num_ of us had incorrect orders .
all of our baked potatoes were hard and cold .
it was a mess .
dismissive associates ... .
needless to say i got no rest .
the sheets also had holes in them .
least professional staff i have ever seen .
on morning one of my visit i accidentally broke the waffle batter machine .
apparently maintenance took lunch and never came back .
rant over .
calling corporate offices to complain about this place ... its beyond unacceptable .
soooo , needless to say , no waffles for me .
this is was far from a hot breakfast if you ask me .
not good .
the common areas ( lobby , breakfast area , hallway ) were nice .
once i got to the room , i was disappointed .
there was a smell as soon as i walked in the room .
the toilet stopped up and i called the front desk .
if my company had n't prepaid for the stay , i would have left .
the front desk staff were very courteous and the coffee and breakfast was acceptable .
it was n't the best but it was n't the worst .
only deserving of _num_ stars .
everything about this place screams a budget hotel , except for the price .
otherwise , do n't be fooled .
the furniture is worn and dirty .
the room smelled like an ash tray .
this has happened the last _num_ out of _num_ times i visited this location .
all honesty , you are better off going somewhere else or a different location .
i will not be bringing it back any time soon .
i ended up getting the parts off line and had them installed elsewhere .
anything more than an oil change , i would n't trust them .
i can not trust them .
i do not recommend .
horrible place , the lobby is dirty and the workers are rude .
this hotel has the worst customer service that i have ever seen .
they were rude and the room was n't clean .
this place is a nightmare .
the price is appealing but not worth it .
the room i was given has water damage in the ceiling near the window .
i asked for a refund and left immediately .
if i could give it _num_ i would .
more midnight traffic than a _num_ hour dennys .
the bed was very uncomfortable !
the entire place was just filthy !
oh , and the free breakfast was nothing more than dry cereal and juice .
the milk pitcher was never once refilled .
i will never return to this dump ever again !
it had fallen on the floor .
it made me worry what smell they were trying to cover up .
but , for the extremely low price ... what did i expect .
i would n't go back , that 's for sure .
for last minute we had the one queen bed room and it was awful .
the carpet was dirty and the room was extremely dusty .
very outdated on the inside .
shower was covered in soap scum .
gross !
spend a few dollars more and stay away .
something must have happened because i was very disappointed last night .
the boneless short ribs was a bad , bad choice for the appetizer .
and sushi is sushi is sushi if they are rolled correctly .
however , the service was not up to par today .
i know that the economy has been hard on everyone , but whoa .
now , i 'm going to update my review from my _num_ review .
menu is pretty standard as far as hibachi grill food items goes .
so , this was definitely a reason to try this restaurant out .
so , lets get back to the menu .
steam rice on the other hand is free ( which i picked ) .
fried rice : eggs , sesame seed , and soy sauce .
no green onions , carrots , and all that other good stuff .
bland .
and mind , i ate two of my party 's portion on noodles .
the tempura , i had no taste for it .
the batter had no taste , as well as the sauce .
that 's not it !
however , the salmon was not good .
it fell apart and had bones in it .
i first ordered salmon sashimi and then got salmon nigiri instead .
overall , i was not impressed with the food but liked the people .
the miso soup was hot but the taste only average .
the service was bad as well !
it was absolutely too much .
there is not much of a raw roll selection .
i am used to more creativity in rolls and this place was lacking .
one of the pieces i received was totally different from what i ordered .
we would not go again , having experienced far better .
sorry i wo n't recommend .
oh , no !
the food does n't have any flavor .
the sushi guy has major attitude .
the sushi is not worth your time .
it had carrots in it .
then they brought out my fried rice .
it was n't the display chef 's fault !
another co-worker who ordered a combo was given the wrong food .
i immediately noticed how unfriendly the sushi `` chef '' was .
what struck me so quickly was how thin the sashimi was cut !
when i mean thin , i mean thin enough to see through the slice !
i was offended .
this `` chef '' is blatantly trying to rip people off .
not here .
while the atmosphere was nice , i did not enjoy the food .
it was probably the least delicious hibachi i have ever been to .
i would not recommend this hibachi .
our chef was lacking any kind of personality or energy .
maybe i came on a bad night ?
i begin to munch on my fries and they were lukewarm .
the milk shake was taking long so i begin eating my room temp nuggets .
nasty , hate this place .
do n't understand why people are obsessed with nasty fried chicken .
busy is not an excuse for under cooked food .
i canceled my membership and they lost a customer for life .
way to keep business drew .
the vending machine for free samples was broken the last two times i went .
my last visit they ran out of shopping carts .
i am not kidding - this is no joke .
when i walked up everyone was busy with customers .
it was actually painfully slow .
unfortunately , one of these items required a return for an even exchange .
i quickly advised the associate this was totally unacceptable and bring a manager immediately .
i again insisted on speaking to a member of management .
another associate handled the actual exchange transaction .
more business than they wish to handle .
it certainly was not me .
worst place ever !
very rude .
the return policy is horrible !
stay away from sales person kevin .
ordered online , waited a month for delivery date .
day comes and they miss the _num_ hour delivery window .
they call me and extend the window .
then they do n't show up until _num_ hours later !
no one called , no apologies .
asked if they would guarantee it would be here this time ?
just the worst customer service i have ever experienced .
staff is extremely rude and unprofessional .
the company never responded to my questions in the store or online .
worse experience ever .
worst delivery experience ever .
i called customer service and they were zero help .
terrible experience !
do not do business with this company .
i have experienced poor customer service and shady salespeople .
it 's difficult to do business with a company that you do not trust .
they never were opened and nothing was applied to the furniture .
do not buy this couch !
total waste of _num_ $ !
they will be extremely rude and give you the run around .
i have never been so disrespected from a customer service rep .
also products are crappy also .
in fact , just about everything here tasted like something else .
so my money is on the lotus buffet .
the first time was so-so , the second time was better .
( gross out side note : their bathrooms need better ventilation .
literally the worst chinese buffet i have ever been to .
sushi was mushy .
vegetables limp and overlooked .
all sauces were too sweet and most tasted the same .
it was n't even warm .
i have no idea how this has n't failed a health inspection .
not the worst chinese i 've had , but definitely not the best .
good for a cheap lunch , but very americanized selection .
greasy unappetizing fried food .
low quality ingredients .
decent food if you 're not a chinese food enthusiast .
low quality food but the $ _num_ lunch special makes it worth it .
horrible service .
had the $ _num_ lunch and it was exactly what i expected .
not a great selection of food .
last week i stopped by to get the battery of my watch changed .
are you kidding me ?
it pains me to write this review .
$ _num_ and $ _num_ is not consistent !
he was just trying to rip me off again .
i was recently at this store to make an expensive jewelry purchase .
not a fan !
there is no sense of customer service at this store .
the dental hygienist was very rude .
never before have i encountered such unprofessional service at a doctor 's office .
i will not be going back to this doctor .
wow , what a bad experience .
she , with no hesitation , denied me any medication for the pain .
i was suffering and she had zero compassion for me .
i paid my bill and left and refused to make another appointment .
i do not recommend this dentist .
she 's a rip off !
disgusting !
unbelievable .
it 's probably cause its just meant for sports and drinks .
but for those who like drinks and sports this would be your spot !
terrible .
ugly dcor , bad food , poor service .
the service is terrible !
i did n't get one smile from either bartender .
when it came out it was missing cheese and had _num_ onion slice .
i will not go again .
well since no one would wait on us , we left .
smells terrible weird mixture of nail polish and sour beer .
nasty .
and the food was bad .
all the pasta for our party was undercooked ; there were _num_ of us .
other customers also were returning meals .
all _num_ entrees ( big family ) ordered were served cold .
not warm , not luke warm , cold !
i had two items : a caesar salad , and a margherita pizza .
the cheese was ok , the tomatoes were flavorless .
it was covered with chopped green herbs .
i had n't been to a macaroni grill in a number of years .
i most likely wo n't be back to one for a very long time .
my wife got mama 's trio .
she did n't really care for any of it .
the worst macaroni grill i 've ever been to !
do not waste your time !
another ordered the fried calamari appetizer ( $ _num_ ) .
this was a disappointment .
another of us ordered the chicken parm ( $ _num_ ) .
nothing special there .
their close proximity does n't win out over quality .
hello new owners ; this is a recipe for disaster .
`` if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . ''
do they have a corporate taste kitchen ?
it was a bucket of dry pasta with some cheese and meat .
a poached egg on top ?
not the way to do it .
besides , the egg pasta was too thick .
do not waste your money .
i had an italian mojito which i do n't recommend , period ... blech .
i would n't get it again .
worst dining experience ever .
_num_ minutes in , he finally gets our drink orders .
_num_ minutes in , finally takes our damn order .
first one , no dressing .
when my food finally came , it was all lacking in flavor .
i did n't see my bill , and was told everything was taken off .
overall , i would never dine here again .
we were visiting friends in charlotte and chose macaroni grill to meet .
the restaurant was practically empty on a sunday afternoon when we met .
everything else ( except the friends ) was disappointing .
this was a work lunch so i had to attend .
hostess greeted the group quickly and was ready to seat us .
not a great presentation of the dining area .
tough , clearly overcooked , and just downright horrible .
will not be visiting again .
the brick chicken did n't taste fresh .
it was like a fast food chicken with that really dried out taste .
anyway , i totally can not remember what i ate here.
terrible service .
thought the staff was incredibly rude .
after we were seated and ordered our food did not all come out together .
the food sucked !
even the salads were watery and bland .
so i picked this place to change his mind .
_num_ minutes later our order gets put in .
_num_ minutes later our appetizer comes out .
i guess she figured we were new and did n't know any better .
okay so the app was meh , main entrees yay !
he ordered a pork dish and i had lobster ravioli .
and it tasted so microwaved .
soup was served cold with basil leaves which were dry .
pasta was ok but too greasy .
please avoid this restaurant !
it is not worth the time or money .
but it was like that through the whole entire meal .
one thing is a mistake , multiple things being out is bad management somewhere .
i am sorry i ca n't give less than _num_ star .
i sat there for _num_ minutes with my family and was ignored .
will never step foot at this place again .
our order was lost from the waitress to the kitchen .
our drink order was also forgotten .
there were _num_ of us so maybe a smaller group may have better luck .
the food was fine , but our service was atrocious .
do n't bother with this place .
first , our waitress went missing a few times .
the manager brought out our food but never apologized .
she was very apologetic .
our other sandwiches were just as disappointing .
just another chain food restaurant .
i long for a real deli in charlotte !
food was meh , nothing special .
tables were all dirty and the drink station was sticky and not very sanitary .
slow service .
this is the second time this has happened in less than a month .
so i made sure the door was locked .
this is an email i received from what seems to be the manager .
very rude .
the room and bed was fine and the hotel did not look run down .
we only stayed one night and went back home .
do not trust this days in .
no refund given .
rude and unprofessional .
you do n't get to see the room .
all i got was a smoking room .
went back and changed and got another smokers room .
out of site till they show you no refund after _num_ mins .
do not trust this days in .
they stole my money .
the room is not worth _num_ bucks .
it 's not worth _num_ bucks .
do n't waste your time or money .
i lost money .
so do n't take my word .
why would they say _num_ mins lose refund .
it 's that bad !
unprofessional when owner says go to hell to a customer asking for refund !
also note they lie when you fight it with your bank .
same price by the airport and your in a luxury .
do n't trust this pace .
unfair _num_ mins refund before you even see a room .
rooms are disgusting .
that 's why they hide the _num_ mins warning out of plan site .
so do n't trust this place and if you want bed bugs .
sheets looked old .
same price and so much better .
room was n't completely clean either .
found food and trash in the refrigerator .
the breakfast was weak .
never going back .
the bathroom was gross , no words other than that can describe it .
it was a pretty bad experience .
i did n't leave a tip for probably the second time in my life .
expansive menu from italian to greek , even mexican !
portion large enough for _num_ meals .
this time especially , my room did n't seem as clean as it should .
you better off staying in a roach motel .
there was no hot water for _num_ days .
cleaning of the room is suppose to be on tuesday .
my room was n't clean when we got back to the hotel .
i would not stay here again .
exercise equipment and some of the dryers and washing machine were broken .
do not waste your money here .
they are also not very flexible .
however , besides that one situation , they typically seem to care .
they 're also very expensive .
_num_ .
_num_ .
however , you have no set vet there , as far as i know .
_num_ .
small dogs may be different .
there is no reason that they should n't have caught that he was dying .
$ _num_ for antibiotics that you can buy at harris teeter for $ _num_ .
without mentioning money once , i was told all that they would do .
i have no need to do that .
did get groom or however they did not give the shot yet .
way too long , for something so simple .
very unpleasant experience with this animal hospital .
took my puppy there for the first time this week .
horrible !
i will not be going back !
well , they noticed he has a couple loose teeth and dirty ears .
needless to say , i am very disappointed .
i was wrong .
they do n't seem to care too much .
i am so stressed out and very worried .
the rest of us gave up and left .
i give this place zero stars .
i would definitely not recommend this place to anyone , even my worst enemy .
i am extremely disappointed .
i have been going here since november and today was horrible .
i left with _num_ finger bleeding , _num_ nails on crooked and skimpy polish .
very disappointed in this place .
would not recommend !
slow service ... took almost two hours to deliver on two separate occasions .
the food was cold both times .
way too much money for the wrong stuff !
ordered delivery food took two hours and was cold .
wing sauce was spilled all over bag .
this additional charge should have been mentioned on the menu .
they deserve zero stars .
confusion on the phone over what they did or did n't have available .
stay away !
nothing special .
big mistake because he did n't check the food .
the tenders had no seasoning on them .
there was nothing to dip my celery in .
very comparable to have an entree and _num_ sides .
i 'm so glad we split it .
it was so loud , i jumped out of my seat haha .
my water was empty for most of the meal and it never got refilled .
however , they brought out one salad and one meal .
like no extra dishes , no splitting anything , etc .
however , afterwards , both of us mentioned it to each other .
wait staff did not come to ask if our steaks were cooked correctly .
worst experience i have had in a longhorn in _num_ years .
would n't recommend it at all .
not going back .
i made an order over the phone for a _num_ oz .
steak for _num_ and was told _num_ to _num_ minutes for pickup .
went to the restaurant at the time i hung up the phone .
i finally got my refund and left the restaurant not happy at all .
i never once got a refill , even when i asked .
she got my order wrong not once , but twice .
the food was just mediocre .
my potato came out very soggy , the steak very much over cooked .
lastly , when she took our check , the waitress yet again disappeared .
never once have i been told the tip amounts at a restaurant .
i would n't recommend eating here , and i certainly wo n't be returning .
i attempted to order an ultimate steakhouse martini with kettle one .
the bartender was the worst experience of the night .
extremely inattentive , uninterested and not warm .
i 'm not an idiot , i can see that .
i was immediately disgusted .
i assume she was the general manager .
when she returned it was only a bill for the martini .
i am utterly surprised they did not compensate my entire meal .
it was flavorless and i had to add a ton of salt .
my server was nice , but not friendly at all .
the salad was very bland and did n't have much dressing .
the bread seemed really dried out and flavorless as well .
oh and drinks for lunch are very expensive !
$ _num_ for a lemonade !
my father was in this facility for a short time ( _num_ days ) .
i can not recommend this facility .
do not go to this car wash .
this location was no different .
buy their upgrades and it is a waste .
i 'm not that impressed .
for $ _num_ , i could do a better job in my garage .
i wo n't be back .
half ass job for more money than i 'm used to spending .
terrible job !
will not go back .
inspection slow and unprofessional .
left my car dirty and smelling of cigarettes .
i usually do n't ask for a receipt unless i donate electronics and such .
i wrote an email using their contact us form and never heard anything back .
it was one of the most frustrating calls ive made in a long time .
very disappointed !
however , their employees and even the manager could n't be efficient about this .
even the manager could n't be any sincere about what had happened .
by the time we ordered , there were _num_ other people behind us .
one time i saw an old lady take a taxi through the drive thru .
i get alright service sometimes , then terrible at other times .
ordered _num_ gallon of sweet tea .
very disappointed .
the most ghetto ran wendy 's i have ever been to .
the staff is ghetto and rude and the food was horrible .
it was cold and old food .
ghetto staff means lack of caring !
never had a problem at this one until today .
yeah i paid _num_ dollars for a ranch packet with a chicken sandwich .
not something you just feel like free styling .
i 've been craving breadsticks since i picked up some from target .
i could n't eat it after the first piece .
bland $ _num_ of waste !
on average probably twice a month .
several times they 've screwed my order up , often leaving ingredients off completely .
so tonight i called my order in ( i usually do it online ) .
but hey , that 's just me .
anyway , that 's not even why i 'm upset .
his reply was that he did n't see it .
i reply that i assure him that i 'm not lying about it .
delivery even on busy nights like saturday is faster than the others .
it 's the execution that lacks .
luckily i do n't mind coke ... .
i really have no idea what it is .
the dining room always looks closed .
i really did n't know what i was supposed to expect .
i wo n't be going back .
then , i went again and it was a different story .
like a cup of water mixed condiments was poured on the burger .
at this point i was angry .
if you want a surprise burger , go to this bk .
if you want extra extra slow service , go to this burger king .
pulled off to the same freaking messed up order !
the sesame chicken was just okay , as was the general and orange chicken .
chicken was way over cooked .
terrible !
tried this place because i was referred by a friend .
i really wish i could rate the complex individually .
however , the worst part about this complex is the front office .
unfortunately , can not say the same about the front office women .
they are incompetent with their jobs .
they can not answer simple billing questions , or requests .
stop apologizing and fix the problem !
shape was uneven and no attention to details whatsoever .
*** this place is horrible !
bland .
gross .
terrible .
not a chance .
as i left i suggested the manager change this policy .
my first try was with the meatballs and pasta .
standard italian food - nothing i could buy at the grocery store .
my spaghetti was watery and had barely enough sauce to coat the watery noodles .
no frills .
issue # _num_ : i ordered the chicken parm sub with fries .
the sandwich itself was mediocre .
not my ideal chicken parm !
it was fine to eat i guess , just not a chicken parm .
no problem , they included tax .
?
umm , why the double tax ?
if not for the nice waitress , would have been _num_ star .
this place is gross .
the food is gross , along with the decor & especially the carpet .
very old and very run down .
staff friendly and all but the place looks dirty .
these people rip you off !
she looked at my shirts .
the other woman tell me i owe _num_ dollars a pair !
go elsewhere trying to save you from a nightmare at the dry cleaners !
had a _num_ month old shirt cleaned here .
said they fixed the hole to `` help me out '' no !
just got a shirt destroyed there .
no offer of apology or credit .
please do not let the star rating for this groomer fool you .
it 's not a good establishment and certainly did n't meet my standards .
hardly worthy of mention here a decade later .
service was weak .
food was not good on three occasions .
my children ordered chicken nuggets , they were burnt .
service was slow .
will not be back despite the `` big '' discount .
no stars would be correct .
this place wo n't be around for too much longer i 'm sure .
_num_ stars .
went for dinner , service was terrible , food was worse .
very disappointing .
salmon was so dry it was difficult to cut much less eat .
not happening again .
too many good restaurants in charlotte to waste time and money here .
she said she would get it changed .
almost immediately she came back and said her manager refused to change our bill .
could n't even finish it , which says a lot for friday happy hour .
it 's sad that the food is so bad .
unfortunately , that 's not enough to bring us back .
there are _num_ restaurants within walking distance of our apartment .
i would rate a _num_ .
bottom line is , do n't do it .
i told him `` just remember , it 's not their fault they suck .
just does n't cut it .
advertised as italian , olive garden should be offended .
did not stick around to argue .
do n't waste your money .
gross !
i did n't eat it .
that 's $ _num_ for _num_ drinks .
the boyfriend lives down the street and we went for breakfast today .
the service was terrible .
ugh .
the food is barely passable .
did n't like it !
sorry but you guys deserve a _num_ .
big mistake .
service was slow and the restaurant was not crowded .
the server kept forgetting to bring requested items , mixed everyone 's orders up .
ordered the lasagna and got mush instead .
it was a pile of cheese in a sea of grease .
wo n't be visiting there again .
our waitress was very friendly but slow .
food is over priced and not very good .
all _num_ in our party was n't pleased with the food .
drinking here might not be bad but eat before you go !
the private room we were in was nice but cold .
it was overcooked and turned gray .
they were cut too thin and therefore hard to control the cooking temperature .
as a result they came out overcooked .
they , again , were not cooked to medium ... overcooked to medium well .
they were not seasoned well .
a good steak never requires steak sauce .
_num_ ) the private room was great but never warmed up .
_num_ ) the server was as good as you could ever ask for .
_num_ ) the food was lackluster .
and the breakfast is n't very good at all .
i 'm just not impressed with their breakfast .
my real issue is with the eggs they served me .
they were burnt and cooked down to nothing .
honestly it looked like one scrambled egg to me .
the salmon was way over seasoned , over cooked and had a suspicious smell .
since it is so close i will probably return for drinks but not food .
servers are awesome , the food is a hole in a wall quality .
rip off .
not happening again , because i 'm never going back again .
no `` thank you '' or `` have a good day '' .
i can not tell you how mad this company makes me .
the next thing i know , i am in collection for $ _num_ .
i mean , this could cost me for a long time .
so here is the kicker that makes me even more mad .
however , here is how they contacted me .
then i wait for someone to come on the line .
absolutely terrible service to have a phone system like this .
just poor service .
it 's not worth it .
poor results and questionable billing .
requested a meeting and no one showed up .
they will not communicate with a simple phone call .
the produce was n't always kept up well either .
the only thing harris teeter has to offer is a better coupon policy .
big disappointment .
i left _num_ minutes after arrival .
ordered cashew chicken , hot and spicy beef and kung pao chicken .
never ever will i order from here again .
ridiculous .
terrible .
_num_ .
_num_ .
simply terrible .
i have one shoe which the sole is falling off .
what 's worse , i found a scratch on the side later .
this place is overrated .
the food is no better then the other burrito places in uptown .
you also get lip from the owner if you want to pay credit .
at that point it goes from mildly amusing to uncomfortable and rude .
no big deal for my me or my wallet .
but it left a bad taste in my mouth .
not a word in _num_ months .
i 've walked in to make purchases .
i 'm usually met with `` next register .
no one seems to care .
none offered .
this is really frustrating .
the contacts have small print and does not allow you to cancel your service .
terrible customer service .
and she was doing me a favor and hung up on me !
unbelievably poor service and super expensive on top of that .
this company 's contract is very frustrating to work with .
overpriced and my muffin was stale .
not worth the $ _num_ i spent on the muffin and coffee .
will not go again .
not good !
really , not good .
i was so disappointed .
strange looking , and bad tasting .
not good at all .
so that was a strange start .
i would n't stay there again for what it cost .
please do not see this vet .
if i could give this place zero stars i would .
this place is terrible .
probably the rudest receptionist and office staff we have ever encountered .
i walked in and was told it was a 30-40 minute wait .
at that time , one of the hair stylist went out back .
of course after having a smoke break , she reeked of smoke .
i could not use the pay at the pump feature with a credit card .
zero stars .
so she is choosing one paying customer over another .
was pleasantly greeted on the phone and my order was taken down promptly .
i payed $ _num_ for a large cheese pizza .
the pizza was nice and hot , but was mediocre in taste .
not many people in there tonight so the selection of pizza seemed minimal tonight .
the pizza now is just ok .
i have had a meatball sub and stuffed shells and they are both ok .
unfortunately , i was let down .
i was told _num_ min .
well _num_ turned into _num_ .
but it 's not great .
i went here originally because there was no monthly contract , _num_ a month .
he put me in the first room , next to the front desk .
too bad .
it took _num_ hours and our pizza was cold .
i sucked it up and ate _num_ pieces of pizza and _num_ wings .
the pizza was flavorless and the crust tasted like cardboard .
needless to say , i will never go back to papa john 's again .
no way are they that busy that early in the mornings .
ridiculous .
Negative
if i could give this place a negative _num_ , i would .
it looked like microwaved pizza and it tasted terrible , cardboard like .
i do n't get how they use better ingredients and it tastes terrible .
the worst thing about coming to fort mill is this mcdonald 's .
the service is awful .
you might ask `` how do you mess up a cup of coffee ? ''
that 's not how i ordered it .
dirty and nasty .
the parking lot is a bit weird to access .
i did n't check the bathrooms .
this particular store sets the bar to a new low .
i will never be back .
employees are unbelievably rude most of the time .
on the bed , there are a couple of dead roaches .
however , the doors are closed and locked shut .
the spot we stayed in was quite long , and very level .
no frills , but not expensive either .
thank goodness we did n't have to use the bathrooms , beyond sketchy !
not at all impressed .
no security whatsoever !
no gates .
yes bar - no one under _num_ allowed .
really only space for our 5th wheel .
not long enough or wide enough for your vehicle too .
still not level and only enough room for camper and _num_ vehicle .
has a nice pool snack shack - but this was not opened .
from that point on , our experience was unbelievably bad .
_num_ minutes later , they appeared .
it took just over _num_ minutes for the food to arrive .
they were all crisp , no potato , and no flavor .
my wife 's veggie sandwich was very plain .
i honestly can not see giving this establishment a rating higher than a _num_ .
i said attempt because they did n't have much to offer .
i pointed out that there is a grocery store within walking distance .
the reply was the owners wo n't let us buy anything .
_num_ ) ok everyone can have a bad day so we returned this sunday .
once again they were out of things but not as bad as last week .
wrong .
there is much more that i can say but this is already a novel .
long story short .
the food sucks and we will not return .
the service is usually mediocre but last night was absolutely terrible .
ridiculous .
it so deserves less than minus !
he refused to give me anything but the store number !
and this office have very bad customer service nobody say hey nobody help .
i feel like they hate any one to go in their office .
less than zero .
these people do not return your calls and they dont want to help you .
first , the area is sketchy at best .
the hotel is very noisy because the walls are paper thin .
( _num_ ) free breakfast but there is no mixing it up ... ... .
( _num_ ) size of the bathroom .
( _num_ ) cleanliness .
( _num_ ) lack of amenities .
the pool was empty ( no water ) mid may .
so glad i did n't send the kids on ahead to the pool .
no one bothered to tell us that the pool was out of commission .
anyone could just walk right up to that empty pool and fall in .
however , it is in the process of being renovated .
in its current state , i would not recommend it .
i did n't see many family during our stay !
waited _num_ minutes for them to check me into someone else 's room .
_num_ more minutes and finally someone came up front .
they checked me into someone else 's room .
this new room stinks of cigarette smoke , it 's filthy inside .
avoid this place at all costs .
still the general manager has not returned a phone call or a text message .
still no contact from the general manager !
the room was clean and the air was cold .
i would def look elsewhere before i booked here .
not the best i have had mediocre and generic for that matter .
not good kinda left feeling sick .
the only plus to this place was the super sized sodas .
nothing about the visit stands out to me .
i probably would not go back .
just a poor , poor experience at this location overall .
luckily for me , i live in rock hill .
secondly , there were ants everywhere !
the room was very small and was not worth the amount we paid .
plus , no free wifi !
this is by far the worst motel _num_ i 've ever stayed in .
eggplant parm was salty .
veal parm was tough and so thin .
the breading was thicker than the veal .
will probably not go back except perhaps to try the pizza .
very forgettable .
it did n't help that the ac was n't working while we ate .
i would not recommend at all .
i will not return , terrible customer service .
she understood but it was the owners call .
and the pizza was n't good .
it had too much cheese and hardly any sauce and it was burnt .
went for the lunch buffet and was very disappointed .
that evening our meal at a family restaurant took _num_ hours .
i was shocked to see that they were using fake frozen meatballs .
it 's a shame .
he was n't rude , i think just not up on server etiquette .
we may try this place again , maybe for the lunch buffet .
i have had better and i have had worse .
the guacamole is always bland .
our waiter greeted us nearly as soon as we walked through the door .
the salsa , although bland , was surprisingly spicy .
becky noticed it too .
not much in the way of flavor though .
becky ordered some meat with chile sauce which came first .
none of the food was anything to write home about .
only people in the place and the waitress messed up a simple order .
chili verde was ok but not worth $ _num_ .
husband had chicken & cheese enchiladas and said they were bland .
i asked for a refund and she said how much was it ?
she finally got the receipt and gave me $ _num_ cash back .
i will never go back into this establishment again .
it 's awful .
been here several times and well , shame on me .
rude customer service in beer section .
called me a liar when i said the beer was stale .
it was an expensive craft beer .
they need to check their dates and stop selling stale , overpriced beer !
the vendor did n't stock your shelves , fool !
just want people to understand truth in advertising .
would not suggest this place to anyone .
especially do not go here if you are a craft beer drinker .
for a destination dinner , i think not .
it 's just not enough to keep us coming anymore .
this place has went downhill bad .
the food is pretty mediocre .
the steak was cooked right but just did n't have much flavor .
after dinner we went on the deck so my daughter could feed the ducks .
it is only for people sitting at the bar .
not good for food .
cost us _num_ bucks for _num_ orders of ribs with one side and soda .
the food was terrible .
my husband and i came here for lunch on a thursday .
the wait staff was helpful and service was quick .
tea was very weak and the glasses were very small .
appetizer , hot wings , were mediocre at best .
not hot and sorta greasy .
wife got salad , which was unimpressive and a little wilted .
it appeared to be pan fried , as is was greasy .
it was a very poor cut of meat , with much fat and gristle .
you pay for a choice cut of meat and get waffle house food .
i went to this place probably _num_ years ago .
was not impressed then .
has gotten worse .
we all went home after and did n't feel like doing anything after this .
the inside smells horrible ... like old and soggy and dusty .
i ordered a salad with salmon which was disgusting .
do n't take a large group because they act like accommodating you is painful .
nice night for a ride across the border but sadly that place just sucks .
unfortunately this is the only restaurant on the lake and they know it .
such a shame they should really get their act together .
no good .
wo n't be coming back .
food just is n't great , never has been .
i feel as though i needed to write this review .
do not waste $ $ on food !
and others as well.
you 've been warned !
this is the worst example of a `` steakhouse '' ever .
tonight was the worst in service and food .
the slaw came and was awful .
they tasted like they had been cooked in burnt grease .
this place needs renovation and cleaned up desperately .
i am sad to see it go down hill .
tonight was a miserable time here .
without fail its always the same .
poor to standard food .
con 's : outdated decor and seating , average food to sub par food .
can be difficult to get a drink sometimes as it does get busy .
today was the worst , though .
i felt bad for the hostess .
gone downhill from the last time i was here .
turned out to be a big disappointment .
french fries were under cooked .
we never lacked for anything .
had two very disappointing dinners here .
our waitress was nice but not very professional .
i am not so sure where that nasty bug ended up .
chicken was dry and the portions were tiny !
nope ... no where to be found on the menu .
after one person took a bite the sour faces were hard to miss !
it was terrible .
after kindly explaining this to my waitress she again was not very professional .
she offered free desert which we did not want because everything else was terrible .
the wrong people are running it .
such a waste !
one exception -- the ribs are not bad and edible !
lousy food .
certainly will not be back !
it could be so much better .
please , if nothing else , clean that place before someone really gets sick !
really makes me wonder how dirty the kitchen is .
went for sunday brunch and was very disappointed .
eggs were cold and the fresh fruit was n't fresh .
there was n't much to choose from on the lunch menu .
worst thing was the loud dance music .
the shrimp in the fish and chips were just terrible .
horrible experience and not worth the money .
the service was incredibly slow .
only had the nachos , which were n't anything special .
so nasty .
every time i 've been here its been worse than the last time .
it 's dirty , food is gross and the wait staff is just pathetic .
decor looks like you have time traveled to _num_ .
but i wo n't be back .
this place is a waste of time .
service is slow and the food is not good at all .
it 's fishy , but it 's not coming from the lake .
that was pretty lame .
my husband was so confused with his sandwich .
it was half a loaf of mini bread with no knife .
it 's dirty , overpriced and the service is poor .
nice location , but i will never go back again .
but the food is horrible .
every appetizer and main dish is horrible .
beer selection is better in my house .
the manager made no effort and allowed me to walk away furious .
i was not the only patron who appeared to have trouble with their order .
simply because of the view i would only go there for a drink .
cocktails were good but menu is very overpriced .
service was just ok .
terrible atmosphere .
very musty , all the decorations appear to be from the early _num_ 's .
you can tell that the place is wiped down but never deep cleaned .
tasted nothing like a carolina burger should .
the chili was tasteless .
the bun was tasteless .
bad all the way around .
which i 'll gladly pay for a fresh ground beef patty .
pitiful excuse for a restaurant .
no leadership in this place .
this place is super gross it 's like eating inside the public toilet .
the food looks like my patients vomit .
food is hit or miss -- usually , miss .
went for brunch .
french toast was like rocks , eggs and sausage were cold .
$ _num_ for two for brunch , not worth it .
food was not very good either .
horrible service ... my husband 's steak came to the table raw !
never checked on , offered additional drinks or dessert .
no apologies for uncooked food !
unfortunately it 's not one of my favorites .
to start , the hostess ' were not very welcoming when we walked in .
no smile , no hi , nothing .
so at this point we were a little taken back but continued in .
just not my kind of place .
i went as part of a group so did not really have a choice .
it was hot - very uncomfortable - inside .
it was loud - very loud - as usual .
the staff is very friendly so that 's why they get _num_ stars .
the owners do nothing to attempt fixing it up .
the food is n't very good at all .
if i could give it no stars , i would .
the place was so disgusting that i had to look up their restaurant rating .
after waiting for a boat slip for _num_ minutes , we finally get in .
we really did n't care where we sat .
we have kids that need to eat and are getting cranky .
it is not a family restaurant .
i would give this place _num_ stars if i could .
bad idea .
we wo n't be going back .
had the chicken salad and lettuce was wilted , fruit was room temp .
chicken wings where not hot .
my wife and i attempted to dine here yesterday and it went very badly .
then my wife and i went to the restroom to wash our hands .
a while later , the waitress refilled our drinks .
it just did n't add up .
the queso dip was cold & thick .
the food was very mediocre .
i will never spend another dime here .
this was the worst mexican food i 've ever had !
the service was slow and prices were way too high for this place !
cheap eats yes but not high quality just typical flavor i guess .
when did simply enjoying the company of your companions fall out of favor ?
too salty to finish .
i ordered a _num_ oz .
for dessert , we shared a peanut butter pie with chocolate sauce .
it 's not bad , but it 's not spectacular .
last time i ate there was the last time .
mushy , times before food was much better .
her steak was over cooked and dry .
i made the mistake of sending mine back .
he had a replacement steak that was just the same as the first .
needless to say , i will not return .
my steak tonight was small in size and one third of it was gristle .
inconsistent service but food is good .
the place always seems busy whether it is happy hour or sunday dinner .
the waitress was a good server so this is solely on tonight 's food .
when anything on the salad is bad , you lose .
i could n't chew the steak .
i just was not going to eat it as i could n't chew it .
i did n't want to talk to the manager .
i was just going to pay for it and leave .
his ribs were refrigerator cold .
i 've already taken the meal off . ''
at that time my husband said he chicken was really good .
we told her just to charge us whatever and we were ready to leave .
i did n't feel the manager was apologetic although she had comped our meal .
she did n't come to our table and apologize for the ribs or chicken .
i would have felt better if she had said that she was sorry .
cold brownie .
our visit on may _num_ was less than stellar .
only came back once to fill our drinks .
my aunt thought she went on a break and did n't bother telling us .
wish i would have chosen some place better to bring my family .
will not be back .
not worth the price for the lousy service we received .
do n't expect great results no matter how much money you spend .
after all that , the treatment didnt work at all .
too bad the man who answers the phone was rude as all heck .
cut me off while talking , was not listening , their loss .
i would n't even bother calling it 's not worth the time .
what an obnoxious , customer unfriendly person .
i would n't even give this place one star .
we use to like this facility very much .
however the facility has also been very accommodating when we needed .
ok for _num_ night stay .
couple running it were very friendly .
biggest peeve is grass not kept .
the worst service and pizza .
they delivered pizza with the wrong toppings .
horrible management and pizza .
looks run down like no one really takes pride in how the restaurant looks .
the fries were horrible .
i wo n't be using the credit towards future business .
they looked like little fat cigarettes !
i had deep fried batter for lunch !
i know my co-workers and i wo n't be coming back .
the service , as mentioned several times in yelp , is really slow .
the restaurant was probably half full of people .
someone else brought us water tho .
nothing much to it at all .
the taste was mediocre .
my co-worker said the omelette was ok .
service was slow and good was ehh .
would not go hear again .
they do not take american express as a side note .
and they taste like cooking oil .
friendly wait staff .
cheese curds , i 've had better .
cod , very dry and still had bones in it .
the guy at the register took my money , did n't say anything else .
seriously the worst pizza hut i 've ever ordered from .
it should n't take more than an hour to make and deliver a pizza .
this is a store that could really use a face lift .
the produce quality was not very good .
not impressed .
seems dated .
produce could use a makeover .
as an added bonus , the ethnic section is a joke .
can we please have a new grocery store already ?
the prices , however , are my biggest beef .
now and then they run a sale : _num_ for $ _num_ .
a _num_ oz .
... hey , how about you just lower your frickin ' prices ?
do n't bother !
oh , wait .
i 've never encountered a company with such an astounding lack of customer service .
just about half the price of the `` promotion '' the representative offered me .
transfer _num_ , to sales !
transfer _num_ , to the internet !
transfer _num_ , to the phone representative ( again ) !
transfer _num_ , to sales ( again ) !
Neutral
there should be a negative rating on here .
it 's not theirs to make sure it work .
they said they could n't do anything better than their listed rate .
that is how much i hate them .
i have called _num_ times and received incredibly poor service .
avoid this company like the plague .
needs more books and homeless people .
sides of hot baked potato and basic iceberg lettuce salad were fine .
waitress amber was courteous and attentive .
if true i am disappointed , al .
boo , bad customer service and not worth the food .
we get the salads and app right away which was mediocre at best .
the waitress says she sorry and puts a quick order in right away .
btw they ordered chicken strips and fries so not very hard to make .
long story short very disappointed with service and food .
mediocre at best .
it was horrible .
i wo n't be back .
the food was barely warm .
the food is usually good , but today we got the worst service ever .
the employees inside had no idea that there was an order matching our number .
maybe someone gave our order to another customer .
he requested his money back .
nothing here .
service was terrible !
people walked in after us and were seated .
not sure what their structure is for seating , but they suck at it .
i will not be back .
nasty & dirty .
the place is full of regulars drinking cheap beer .
but still way way too crowded .
then someone came over and said hi .
so she then tried to help things along .
tried sitting outside and the waitress did not make us feel welcomed .
she was rude and careless .
we walked inside to the bar where the bartenders were a lot better .
seems like they have enough customers and do not need to be nice anymore .
too bad because the beer was nice and cold .
there were n't many patrons in the dining room .
needless to say , i will not be returning .
service was slow , just getting a drink was an effort .
no way coming back other than drinks in the summer .
ate there last night with a group of friends .
it was cold and tasted very old .
the fries that went along with it were also extremely salty .
now , not worth the salt .
we had a horrible experience here last summer .
decided to give a chance again this summer and it 's worse !
service is slow .
wait staff is not trained .
this had not been discussed at the time of booking a few hours earlier .
cheap bar food .
i was there on monday december _num_ , _num_ .
when it was not on , we went back to the counter .
no one was there .
i waited another _num_ minutes .
tried this because it 's local .
terrible , bland chinese food .
not much else to say .
no , i just got home .
it was another _num_ minutes before i received the correct order .
no offer of a refund .
no sincere apology .
i was wrong .
i tried to ask for some , but she walked away .
the meal was very disappointing to say the least .
the wait staff were completely absent outside of delivering the food .
took four kids tonight and we were all underwhelmed .
the chicken egg drop soup was oddly sweet .
even the dipping sauce just tasted like soy sauce .
the calamari was not tough .
i 'm sorry .
fool me once , shame on you .
fool me twice , shame on me .
dry and flavorless .
the service was also slow .
they refilled our glasses only once , after we had asked for the check .
i wo n't be going back .
the entree my dining companion ordered was also sub-par .
our chicken sizzling rice soup was flavor less and completely watered down .
the staff was very kind but a little annoying .
this is the worst chinese food my entire family has had in years .
we all ordered different things and none of us could eat our meals .
that was $ _num_ wasted .
how do you mess up beef fried rice ?
the mongolian beef had a flavor but it was all wrong .
how do places keep getting good reviews when they are so bad .
so that made me excited and i did not hesitate in my ordering .
there was hardly any meat to be had .
all in all an extreme disappointment .
we ended up tipping and not making a fuss ... just another lesson learned .
the egg rolls taste like they came out of a box in the freezer .
the same problems plague the entirely unremarkable crab rangoon .
not spicy enough , and far too sour .
it was also very greasy and watery , and tasted extremely bland .
waited a full _num_ hours for our food .
talking to friends over the weekend , we were told it was pretty good .
pot stickers - both steamed and fried - which were pretty good .
for hours - over two to be exact .
flavors were safe and my spicy shrimp was n't very spicy at all .
she complained and the waitress brought out a side of broccoli .
that is not true at all !
i do not recommend this place .
the food was bland , lukewarm and it had texture .
it was n't chicken , and it definitely did n't taste like chicken .
for everyone that gave this place more than one star .
however , lately they have fallen out of bed .
disappointing .
old , old fruit for my garnish in my drink .
for the price , they should have cut fresh fruit .
i 'm a little confused .
it 's basically the typical americanized , overpriced sit-down chinese restaurant .
the bbq pork in our appetizer was almost cold and chewy .
other items on the appetizer platter were okay , but lacked seasoning .
our entrees were n't much better .
the very odd thing about the sauce was that it was too sweet .
just very weird .
no , no .
service was very poor , the minute we stepped in .
the restaurant had several empty tables .
the food was absolutely mediocre .
the only nice thing about this place is the ambiance .
unfortunately the quality of the food is quite low .
the rice , for instance , was the worst i have ever eaten .
i do n't recommend this restaurant to anyone .
there are much better chinese restaurants in madison and they are cheaper !
service was very poor , the minute we stepped in .
the restaurant had several empty tables .
the food was absolutely mediocre .
i literally just walked out of the establishment .
she was hesitant to give me a straight up answer .
she said ummm not really !
she needs more training in customer service .
ate here once with a buy one , get one coupon .
i wo n't be heading back .
beans were ok , rice , not so much .
i probably wo n't be back .
not enough servers at their new location .
if you go when it 's busy , beware .
this was somewhat disturbing seeing as they are constantly touching dirty plates and towels .
the chips ... kinda bad .
super weird consistency and zero salt .
our second basket was better , but still lacking .
the salsa was ok ... not amazing but not bad .
he said no problem .
i 'm eating very slowly because i want that hot sauce .
it 's now been probably _num_ min since my margarita came .
bottom line , drinks : yay !
it was a certified used vehicle so it was still under warranty .
i just wish that 's who we would 've went to first .
his level of customer service was appalling .
i complained but got nowhere .
excuse me ?
it is $ _num_ just to walk in the door .
_num_ - the locker rooms are old and sort of creepy .
you probably are n't either .
am i going to stop going there as a result ?
no , it 's too convenient .
the lava cakes were barely cooked and therefore inedible .
the pizza was not bad .
Positive
which i guess explains the attitudes of the staff .
this michael 's location is a disaster .
they do n't have really any good stores that make me stop and shop .
there really is no big draw .
on top of all this the location is horrible .
the whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth .
service has always been very slow , despite _num_ baristas working at the counter .
horrible , horrible , horrible service .
slow , unfriendly staff who refuse to even talk to you sometimes !
i did not leave a tip .
they staff is friendly enough , but they are still a service biased company .
is annoying , but not the end of the world .
i think i even gave them good reviews in here before .
dude thought he should argue with me about it so i got a refund .
went there on saturday night to get some food to go .
on of the worst chinese buffets i 've seen .
half of the trays were empty and other half were almost empty .
very little selection .
that being said , i would not recommend the place to friends .
some of the food on the buffet is quite good .
not sure why i keep deciding to come back here .
no thanks .
this buffet is by far the worst buffet i 've ever been to .
the fried rice was only a little and old and hard .
waiting to see if they would bring any new food out ... but nope .
they would not bring any food out until dinner time which is 4pm .
we could n't stay and wait one more hour until they serve dinner .
and there was no other customers but us .
what a waste of money !
the worst part is , i got sick for _num_ days after .
worst place ever !
this is just ridiculous in this day and age to not accept cards .
even worse is the bs sign on the register .
but seriously _num_ min for a slice of quiche and a breakfast sandwich ?
we told them just make the drinks , forget the food .
even so the drinks took _num_ minutes .
would not recommend until they work their production issues out .
disappointed .
hire another cook and install another stove .
but very slow service , and overpriced .
only takes cash or check !
ugh .
i wo n't be wasting my money again .
i 'm confused why anyone would choose to go here .
i ordered the thai curry noodles .
not impressed .
i 've never tasted something that claimed to be curry with so little flavor .
my vegetables were obviously charred and they still sent me the dish .
not even the chili garlic sauce did much to it .
almost thought i was in los angeles again .
this is not very good asian food .
i would suggest that there must be a better choice in madison .
i am sure there are asians in madison .
i am sure chin 's would not be on their list .
i 've never dined in , so i wo n't comment on atmosphere .
for the most part , i 've had ok experiences with the food selections .
it 's nothing really special .
i ordered a shrimp and veggie stir fry to go .
yeah , next time i 'll get my own lunch .
i ate it but will definitely not go there again !
it fell short in ambiance and flavor for me .
i did n't feel like this had a lot of flavor .
it was awkward .
it went on for about _num_ minutes and really made my stop there interesting .
after cream cheese wontons , pad thai is one of my favorite asian entrees .
dull gray , soupy , greasy , salty and watery , yet somehow sticky .
epic fail on this entree .
instead , however , they were the same brown color as the fried rice .
my last fortune cookie said i 'll probably return to chin 's .
we tried to order for delivery because we are _num_ miles away .
on their menu it says $ _num_ minimum .
i was n't paying for a meal twice and getting attitude from this guy .
terrible customer service !
not very friendly to start .
not very consistent with service or procedures .
i will not be back .
poorly run .
panda is doing better then this .
no sweet , no sour .
not so freshly made !
so we left never going back first and last !
i called to find out what was on the hot and spicy chicken .
on top of that , there was no broccoli .
it was cut so thin and had no chicken flavor .
fairly basic .
i wo n't return there .
the service is less than stellar .
plus , i do n't care for the taste of their ice cream .
maybe it is just me , but i think it 's overrated .
the texture is far too gooey for my liking .
* flavor - the ice cream here is too sweet .
it 's really kind of a depressing place to visit now .
i do n't recommend going there .
my wife ended up waiting _num_ minutes for this .
as we were waiting , i noticed how dirty the entire interior was .
it looks like the floors and base boards have not cleaning in months .
i did not check the bathrooms , too scared to try .
it is a waste of time and money .
one was apple pie and the other was cheesecake .
it looks terrible does n't it ?
either i was _num_ ] not a regular or _num_ ] a bother .
darts , pool , tuesday blues night ( live blues band !
it 's not so bad , but it 's just not that good .
we had pizza there the other night and i could taste the freezer burn .
sorry , boar - the truth can hurt .
so yeah , no . ''
rude .
excuse me for wanting to try your establishment .
so disappointing that 's how people think a business should be run .
my latest visit was not the best .
fine ... no big deal , i got to use my coupon .
so much for being a loyal customer .
unfortunately we choose cousins .
we got there and ordered _num_ subs with fries and cheese curds .
it took us nearly _num_ minutes to get our food .
there were _num_ men making subs and taking orders , it was moderately busy .
it 's absolutely pathetic and borderline useless .
poor customer service .
unfortunately , we were unable to drink this bottle of wine .
we took one sip and realized it was bad .
the nose was off , and so was the taste .
they have decent drink specials .
ive never had their food but ive heard its pretty decent .
overall it an ok place to go to get a few drinks .
sadly its one of the better bars in middleton .
little disappointed with my beer too .
there were maybe _num_ people there , all sitting at the bar .
maybe they only serve locals .
there were n't remotely interested in us or our business .
wednesday night , september _num_ , _num_ .
sunday morning , was looking forward to a bloody mary .
after over _num_ minutes we left .
was n't even busy , one bartender was standing around doing nothing .
i was really excited to come here and usually really like cajun food .
i could n't finish it and left hungry .
i 'm hoping it was just a mistake .
yelpers , you let me down !
boy , it was a huge disappointment .
bisque was on the salty side , but it was ok with the bread .
i wish i could have stopped my meal here ... .
so i ordered that just to try the raspberry dressing , and huge disappointment .
it came with this layer of oil , and not enough `` sauce '' .
when i poured onto my salad it was just drenched in oil .
i did n't even eat the salad .
i only ate the shrimp .
the service was soooooo slow that night .
ugh .
then , it was an even longer wait to order dinner .
our empty plates sat on our table for _num_ minutes .
i got tired of trying to flag someone down all evening .
there was no bam !
completely disgusting !
what a mess of a hotel .
the hotel was totally booked .
of course the hostess acted like an office temp , with a bad attitude .
i could n't check out of that hotel fast enough .
lesson learned for next time .
unacceptable !
service was terrible .
one of the guests had to wait about _num_ minutes for the meal .
horrible !
it 's hard to believe this is a marriott property .
it greatly lacks attention to detail .
i immediately changed rooms and the tv did not work .
all of the power in the room was then knocked out .
i was lucky my computer was not fried .
i will not stay here again and do not recommend it for business travelers .
_num_ ) what the hell is with the _num_ lbs .
which is n't enough .
seriously , you really expect people to use these pieces of junk ?
bedding was stained on pillow and comforter .
after arriving back at the hotel , bedding had not been changed .
not acceptable .
the food on the other hand was overpriced and gross .
i complained , they said sorry and that was it .
platinum member service my butt .
despite having over _num_ rooms , they only have _num_ elevators .
the food is also terrible and overpriced .
checked in to a room on the 6th floor ( out of _num_ ) .
eventually one of them fell ... .
this marriott kind of feels like an airport hotel .
both hotels feature an open atrium that goes up _num_ to _num_ levels high .
it is only a _num_ to _num_ minute drive to madison though .
this marriott would not be a good property for a long stay .
this hotel just does not feel fresh enough .
and i 've been marriott platinum for _num_ years !
worst marriott experience in twenty years of traveling .
the hotel manager is a joke and very rude .
terrible value .
this place should be like $ _num_ a night .
during the wedding , all i saw was how things were going wrong .
so unfortunately , i did n't enjoy majority of my reception .
first night not so great .
immediately apparently means _num_ minutes later after you call again to the front desk .
no one in the room next to me , alarm clock goes off .
waited _num_ minutes , and called back .
cold showers two morning 's in a row .
they do n't give a darn .
it is loud and noisy , seems like lots of kids running around .
i could n't get out fast enough .
if i could give this hotel zero stars , i would .
when i checked out , no one asked me how my stay was .
_num_ days later they sprayed that again .
more than one occasion they came before the agreed upon time .
i asked for a delivery time and it came _num_ mins early .
i just gave up .
the coin operated laundry was another in consistent experience .
the dispenser in the laundry room was broken .
the girl behind the desk told me it was $ _num_ per box .
this hotel was a mistake from beginning to end .
honestly i am not convinced our billing ever did get corrected .
do n't stay here if a good night 's sleep is your goal .
even complaining to management does n't do any good .
this one is a big fail .
what i found was a large room filled with unappetizing , boring baked goods .
nothing in here did i want , or have any desire to try .
chocolate chip , peanut butter , sugar ?
when i picked up the cake the following week it was stale .
: ( disappointing .
it was n't as good as i had hoped .
i like my croissants light , buttery , and flakey .
sadly , my croissant was none of these things .
i was n't pleased with it .
i responded back to the email and never received and sort of follow up .
disappointing .
this is very misleading .
if i could give this place _num_ stars , i would .
hotel was clean and service was meh .
she said she would n't know til _num_ .
i did n't hear from them at all which is so annoying .
the alarm clock was off by almost a half hour .
their wake up call was also about _num_ mins off .
i stayed at the hilton garden inn the friday night before my wedding .
walls are thin .
she just looked through the lost & found list without putting me on hold .
then she suggested i leave a voicemail for brenda the head of housekeeping .
their staff is dishonest and unprofessional .
do not stay here .
the staff is very rude .
very disappointed .
the pizza is what you expect , nothing better than ok .
that sucks .
gross !
i generally love papa johns , but this one is lacking in all areas .
apart from that , the staff lacks any work ethic or customer service .
the three people i dealt with were all rude and careless .
initially , they ended up giving me a $ _num_ credit .
you could have fooled me .
that was disappointing .
nothing to write home about .
so , better pizza ?
are you kidding me ?
sorry papa john .
i checked with them if they deliver and they said yes .
the store manager 's attitude was horrible .
i will never order pizza from this store nor any people i know !
i was so disappointed after reading all of the reviews .
sandwiches come with chips , not fries .
the total was just under $ _num_ without tip .
if not , plan on spending about three times too much there .
trying to get the check out of her was terrible .
in short , we will never return .
the scene reminds me of ... a garage .
seriously that is what we were told .
sorry to hear your mom was a lousy cook .
yes the food is pretty bad .
why people go here i ca n't understand .
i gave it three visits before passing judgement .
as one of the reviewers mentioned the breakfast was very oily .
taste was just ok.
wo n't be going back .
how this place has _num_ stars i do not understand .
but the bacon was under cooked and pretty soggy .
the pancakes were pretty tasty , though .
my boyfriend ordered eggs with bacon and toast and complained about the same things .
his eggs were under cooked and the bacon was again , soggy .
the toast was fine but how can you really mess up toast ?
service was super slow .
our meal was $ _num_ and probably should have cost around $ _num_ .
not to mention the surprise that they do n't take credit cards .
the moment i walked in i regretted it immediately .
the smell is terrible , like stale cigarette smoke .
the eggs were under done but the toast was fine .
needless to say i am in the market for a new barber .
very unhappy with my haircut .
walked in and got an app .
she took off about _num_ inches made me look like a five year old .
the worst .
not cool .
this is by far the worst ups store i have dealt with .
i live no where near middleton and refuse to pick it up .
if i could give this zero stars , i would .
there was no one else in the store .
you wo n't be getting my business ever again .
nonetheless , i will never spend another dollar in this place .
on another note , the people at fedex were pretty nice .
very unprofessional ... just ca n't trust them .
if you can , avoid the surly dude there fine most of the time .
cheap food , but everything fried on a friday tastes like fish .
i do n't know prices .
_num_ stars : the food is terrible .
terrible .
_num_ star : the service was lacking .
overall , _num_ stars .
was fairly busy but not packed .
was told it would n't be long .
promptly left , wo n't be back .
menu was full of bland comfort food .
entire place smelled like vomit and was dirty .
average service , below average food and terrible atmosphere .
i wanted to like it , i really did .
the waiter seated us -- close to the kitchen , i realized with disappointment .
his french onion soup was decent , but my salad was lacking .
i was disappointed when my next piece was also quite fatty .
i pushed the dish off to the side and settled for my potato .
over all , it just was n't enjoyable .
menu was extremely limited .
the third possible main dish was trout and i forget the fourth .
the desert had no prices .
trust me , this place is a bust .
i wish i could review that lady on here .
especially when the one cashier is sooooooo slow .
a drive thru is suppose a little quicker service of getting your food .
and the food was not worth the price i paid for it .
this is not the first time i 've had this kind of service there .
the people working there also do n't seem like they want to be there .
i do n't know why i even tried going back .
the selection looked appetizing , but tasted horrible .
the waitress was poor .
really tasteless and not good .
some pieces were way over cooked .
big mistake .
the food was awful .
too bad the food was n't .
i would be embarrassed to serve this !
ca n't justify going back ... .
the _num_ rating is only because our server was awesome .
it 's to bad this attitude does n't extend to the kitchen .
the kitchen does n't seem to care about customer service .
kitchen does not care .
the kitchen does not know the meaning of hospitality .
went for mother 's day brunch and it was n't good at all .
tried to purchase some dj equipment from this company .
i run several companies and have never run into to this .
does n't make sense especially in this economy .
delicate product was not shipped with appropriate packaging .
i wo n't be ordering again .
i really wish i had read these reviews before ordering from this company .
i selected overnight shipping because i really needed them the next day .
after all day i never received a shipping confirmation so i called again .
still no confirmation yet after _num_ days .
if i could give them _num_ stars .
the meh : the hushpuppies were 1/2 way decent , but nothing extraordinary .
no honey offered with them though .
i 'm going to have to revisit in the near future to investigate .
i do n't know why anyone would go here twice .
so disappointed .
the food is n't fresh .
sandwiches and burgers do not come with fries or anything .
atmosphere was awful .
my experiences in this store have not been good for some years now .
not only is the quality bad , but the service is horrendous .
getting a fitting room in that place is a disaster .
_num_ .
nobody greets you when you walk in .
( customer service _num_ ) .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i 've been three times and each time sucked more than the time before .
disgusting .
you are a mess !
an absolute mess .
and you 're consistently a mess .
this place needs an iron fist .
the burgers are okay , but there are better ones in madison .
our burgers were unremarkable - not that flavorful or moist .
the buffalo wings were greasy and actually not hot when we got them .
tonight 's offering was a step above cafeteria chicken strips .
for almost $ _num_ , i 'm calling this a total bust .
this place does n't suck , but it 's not very good .
with chicken , it cost $ _num_ .
no no no .
it was scary pink and super soft -- like raw hamburger generally is .
i 'm not .
the food is so-so at best .
why bother to pay for a premium products if they are n't properly prepared .
this meal was a disappointment .
also , the french fries had probably been prepared _num_ minutes previous .
the waitress even apologized for her lack of attention .
gave us free drinks , and coupons .
this place is usually a fave but the recently its been not so good .
it took our party of _num_ two hours to get our food .
our family of six went there may _num_ , _num_ at 5:30 pm .
all we ordered was hamburgers and chicken sandwiches .
it was n't even busy and it was on a wednesday night .
do n't worry i did n't know about them until i came to wisconsin .
i am going to do my car at home from now on .
had i known , i would certainly made a reservation .
does not live up to a recent review in madison paper .
cons : too pricey & ala carte .
the entrees : $ _num_ - _num_ .
unbelievably disappointed .
i 'm in town for business , and went on a week night .
the bread i wish were warm .
not going back .
we were very disappointed .
the noodles were just falling apart .
so we 'll probably not ever go back .
i ca n't believe people rate this four stars on average .
hit or miss .
mostly miss actually .
they also use poor quality cheeses that had little flavor .
we were not too impressed .
we were staying in madison and drove over _num_ minutes to get here .
i wish we would n't have wasted our time .
we wo n't waste our time going back .
ick .
maybe i 'm just bitter .
cold .
the food is nothing worth writing home about .
unfortunately , the beer is n't cheap , nor were there other obvious specials .
_num_ on a friday night with two of my buddies .
we all got the fish fry plus some deep fried shrimp .
service was attentive , but everything seemed to go wrong .
cole saw sucked , it was soggy lettuce smothered in warm mayonnaise .
terrible service .
very rude and the managers seem to treat their employees with no respect .
food is ok but not worth a trip over to this joint .
i do n't recommend .
bad experience .
burger was okay , but over cooks and not very flavorful .
fried chips and onion rings were not good either .
this place is awful .
rubber greasy curds .
dirty greasy chicken fingers and very small portions .
the food is not so great and neither is the beer on tap .
stopped in for breakfast on sunday .
how hard is it to screw up breakfast ?
not again .
stopped here for the 1st ( & last ) time around 1:30 friday afternoon .
six of us went here for friday night fish .
the salad bar is not beautiful as was described by another reviewer .
the fish was edible , but there is way better fish fry out there .
it could stand a few updates .
it is a terrible place to see live music .
if you are not facing the stage , the sound is terrible .
there is limited table space in the bar in general .
ordered a chicken quesadilla for an app which was really good .
had a hamburger wrap for meal which i did n't care for .
menu is typical bar food .
after a long while we realized she must have left for good !
she was really busy and she looked surprised we needed the check .
seems like our waitress had n't told her .
she was busy and nice ... still just took along time .
the corn sat there the whole time we ate our meal .
i wo n't be back .
shame on you jiffy lube !
did someone over rate this place ?
well they missed the boat .
my omelette was weak at best , and i mean weak .
it as over cooked and anything but an omelette .
not just a lot , but dripping and soggy .
c 's is just a greasy spoon .
needless to say one guy was outside and one inside .
crappy customer service .
worst service ever .
terrible customer service .
was not allowed to talk to a manager when requested .
the door locks are a joke .
it could be worse i guess .
my rating used to be four stars , yes that 's four stars .
i would n't even give this one star now .
living here has turned out to be a complete nightmare .
they are not military friendly at all , they claim to be .
the bruce company is very , very expensive .
i left and went to ace hardware on university avenue .
yes , i was a little stressed .
she would n't give me an answer .
poor service , high prices , crappy selection .
fail .
not to my surprise , no one showed .
_num_ ) the customer service at this store is terrible .
the employees are rude , particularly scott who works in the plant section .
_num_ ) the plants this past summer were infested .
disgusting .
alas , customer service is poor .
so i left .
i 've been a bruce co customer for well over a decade .
after today , i will never be back .
excuse me ?
no apologies .
rating is really _num_ and based upon the beers sampled .
lots of options but not that great .
our tour guide was the worst tour guide i 've ever had .
many of us realized she was completely clueless .
at least _num_ in one room of the tour .
the beer garden was out of the most popular styles .
shirt sizes in the gift shop were limited .
too bad i 'm on vacation now .
the free pint glass & four samples were n't worth the $ _num_ .
the only positive was the food provided by a local restaurant .
i got _num_ dozen donuts , and it was $ _num_ !
maybe they deserve _num_ stars .
we just picked up a custom cake for a colleague 's going away .
holy crap , it 's crap looking .
he showed me the old one and it was black as night .
now , i 'm _num_ miles away and ca n't do anything about it .
i would never rent here again .
very disappointed in this operation .
biggest disappointment was they smoked in my vehicle while installing .
now ever time i get in i smell cigarettes .
or maybe just feel like it .
my expectations were not that high .
the food is mediocre , even for fast foot 's low standards .
slow service .
absolutely unreasonable .
i would give this bk a _num_ star if i could .
the wait in the drive-thru is painfully slow !
this bk needs better management and training for the employees .
they just do n't seem to care .
avoid at all costs !
_num_ minutes to get my order .
terrible service !
not acceptable !
have been there several times and it 's always super slow .
we stood there for _num_ minutes waiting for somebody to take our order .
unless you like being ignored , avoid , avoid , avoid !
stopped in for lunch today and the place was pretty much empty .
not even worth one star !
i went through the drive through , with about _num_ cars ahead of me .
waste of my time and money !
everything at this bk takes ten minutes .
does n't matter what you order , be prepared to wait .
this place is a hole .
why does the food taste weird ?
this place is slow beyond belief .
i waited _num_ min for my order which was wrong and cold .
awesome !
worst bk i 've ever been to !
should take _num_ minutes to get a nice cream cone .
worst bk ever .
avoid !
still very slow service at drive through .
no wonder there are never cars outside !
the cheese burgers are quite gross .
the cheese is what i imagine fake , fake cheese is like .
the chicken nuggets and sandwiches are also passable .
however i do not plan on visiting another burger king any time soon .
literally on even one croutons or slice of tomato nothing but shredded lettuce .
i let it ring about _num_ times and then hung up .
same deal : lots of ringing , no answering .
i let it ring another _num_ times or so and just gave up .
i do n't mind having someone answer and then immediately put me on hold .
it 's a lot better than the nothing that i got .
thumbs down .
for a taco bell , this one is horrible .
this is the most amazingly slow drive through ever !
never , ever go here .
like over cooked and then sat out for a couple of hours .
then i drove back and went inside and i talked to the manager .
pointed out the problem and asked them if they would eat something like that .
doing some food prep for my job , i called bs on her .
in the end , would not recommend the taco bell .
so slow .
instead of offering napkins the girl just shut the window & turned around .
horrible service .
taco bell back then only existed in south western states .
this is the worst taco bell i 've ever been to .
tonight we placed an order got home and half the order was wrong .
their food is terrible if you ever get it .
plus , they never get it right .
wait time in the drive thru runs between _num_ to _num_ minutes !
worst taco bell ever !
horrible place & service .
there is always something missing from the drive thru order .
and the service is always painfully slow .
they told me it would be $ _num_ .
unfortunately at this location i was n't given a chance to get a pizza .
i walked into the store at _num_ minutes to 8pm .
you do n't even bake the pizza !
my first time at this location and was disappointing .
place was dirty and the worst pizza ever .
for $ _num_ that is a rip off , a joke and unacceptable !
boy , was i disappointed !
so that was ridiculous right off the bat .
sadly , this was not the case .
but i highly doubt we 'll make our way there any time soon .
ordered egg rolls , steamed dumplings , garlic beef and orange chicken .
tasted low quality .
the garlic beef was cold and the meat was very fatty .
extremely low quality chicken on the orange chicken .
food was just low quality .
so , i stand and wait .
not saying they had to immediately hand me my order , but come on !
do yourself a favor , avoid this place .
not overly impressed .
pretty bland for chinese take out .
do n't bother .
this place is sort of gross .
next , the shopping experience was n't much better .
no one ever greeted me or asked if i needed help .
the inside of the building smells really bad .
i did not like my experience , and i wo n't go back .
but we would n't know because no one ever came to the counter .
we arrived around 4:30 p.m. and there was no one else in the deli .
not much interest in those , huh ?
it 's just not worth it .
the building has been recently remodeled because it burned .
gross .
it was 2pm on sat and dead .
no excuse for dirty .
the waitress was really nice , i think her name was sarah .
i 'm not joking .
it 's just a numbers thing at this point .
two of those came wrong again .
too little too late .
kids got hot dogs , ugh , just buy a better brand people !
unbelievable and with my little girl there .
disgusting ... .
food sucked and i through left overs and cake in garbage .
had n't been to this restaurant in yrs and will never go again !
i 'm not sure what all the rave reviews for this place are about .
you should never have to wait that long at a diner !
sorry , but it was .
the pita bread was not pita , but large tortilla .
needless to say , i will not be back again .
poor quality food , very typical american fare .
our server screwed up both our orders , would n't recommend to anyone .
warm old school feel is ruined by lack of food quality .
this location does not have good service .
any other kfc would be better .
well , my first time was typical mediocre kfc .
then i made the bold , yet stupid decision to dine here again .
the tv reception is absolutely horrible .
)
finally , after my pushing , she looked it up on my file .
i 'll buy my product there from now on .
the previous review i wrote was pretty bad .
the selection was slim to non .
the employees at this location vary from indifferent to pretty helpful .
no big deal , right ?
this was in no way faster than just going through a regular register .
having the last part be the worst part did n't help .
this is not unusual for wally world these days .
no one said a word .
i 'm not even sure they noticed .
could have been a bad day but will never come here again .
i wish i could leave zero stars , but that 's not an option .
so probably expecting too much .
i 'm embarrassed to be writing this review .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
just be very cautious when dealing with this dr .
avoid this place .
piss poor customer service doesnt even begin to cover it .
dont hire these people .
walked by , saw me , and kept going without any acknowledgement .
bottom line : this pharmacy has bad customer service .
i worked at a walmart pharmacy years ago , as a technician .
as with any retail business , employees come and go rather quickly .
she 's been there for _num_ years , she told me so .
it 's completely hit or miss with customer service .
all this time i 've managed to avoid them , except for once .
let me break it down for ya .
hide the powdered doughnuts . ''
i felt sorry for the bride and groom .
the place was not clean for starters .
the food was the worst part .
i had the sirloin , it was cold , chewy , and bland .
food is below average and pricey .
the place looks really good but i was really disappointed with their food .
almost everything sucks in their menu except the omelette and bacon .
omelette was one of the item which did n't disappoint me .
the maple syrup was n't up to the mark .
donuts sucked .
sausage and scrambled egg were okay .
cakes were n't good .
the staff were n't friendly enough .
they did n't even take care of us properly .
they were in bloody hurry always though it was just a brunch going on .
they were not changing or replacing the dishes on the buffet counter .
i did n't like the food and the service at this place .
i do n't know how it would be if i order from the menu .
but they did n't pull off the brunch properly .
the cost of the food was n't worth it at all .
it was a waste of money .
i left the place unsatisfied and disappointed .
additionally the fish was not hot , fishy tasting and overall not good .
we sat down and had to wait _num_ more minutes for a menu .
whatever the reason , this has not been an enjoyable experience .
do n't go in the drive thru if there are more than _num_ cars .
you will sit there for _num_ minutes .
bland burgers , bland hot dogs , and expensive as all get up .
so needless to say we did n't ask for a single sample .
next time we will not going back .
the cheddar tasted sweet ( i know , weird , right ? )
the port wine cheese spread was okay but nothing special .
disappointed .
clean , noisy room .
very poor breakfast .
coffee horrible .
did not give ana or aaron discount as they said they would .
your just going to waste your money !
no , it is n't .
grey is grey and pink is pink .
even into high school in the 90s i continued to shop here happily .
i 'd even like to give you _num_ stars for effort .
horrible .
it is difficult to even find one .
unfortunately , my insurance does not allow me to go many places .
i have really tried to avoid going again .
then i did it , i made an appointment .
evening , busy time .
ok , maybe they are a little late .
apparently another appointment was waiting .
no one bothered to tell me that they were running late .
i do not know , i do not know .
all in all , i 'd pass on this store .
might be the worst vinyl focused store i 've been into .
we are shopping on amazon tonight .
he tried to make me feel like it was my fault .
nope .
not going to spend money here again .
it was not appealing to me .
easily the worst chinese food that i 've eaten .
our general tso 's chicken was terrible .
very bland and overcooked .
the flavor was also very strange , and tasted like ketchup .
just terrible .
the crab rangoon were n't much better .
the interior of this joint is also disgusting .
wallpaper is peeling off the walls , and in general it looked filthy .
customer service was also really bad .
we stopped in around _num_ pm and it was completely dead .
avoid .
only rice and onions .
especially if they request them !
ordered the mongolian beef combo and fried dumplings .
i 'm not sure what was delivered , but it was not mongolian beef .
wo n't eat here again .
the food was nasty .
the language barrier was rough as well .
to make matters worse the food was barely lukewarm .
i wo n't be ordering from this place again anytime soon .
beef curry was okay .
call them on their crap !
the staff sucks beyond rude .
should n't be in business .
do n't know how to make drinks .
do n't waste your time or money going to this place .
the nut job lady in the morning needs to be on meds .
the problem i have over and over is the service .
three times ive been in and every time they are under staffed .
tonight i ordered the chimichangas .
instead of one big one , you get two smaller ones .
they also offer flautas , i wonder if they 're just the same thing .
not sure what all the hype is about .
no vegetarian options , and staff always too busy and not personable .
they never check my online order !
i called an hour later and they had not even started to cook !
not worth the time !
it was horrible !
fried rice included soy sauce and carrots only !
no flavor .
the chicken dishes had fat on the meat .
i had high hopes , and they simply could n't have fallen farther .
i had tofu mixed vegetables , which is my go-to .
just no .
the vegetables were not just mediocre quality , but clearly past their prime .
i 'm talking soggy , wilted , and literally , barely even edible .
in conclusion , poor quality food , questionable sanitation , very very limited seating .
i ordered takeout from here tonight .
i probably wo n't be going back here .
the soup was so bad , i could not finish it .
i would not feed it to company at my home .
i live _num_ minutes away , food took _num_ hours to get here .
i complained and they said they would make me more soup .
i will not go back to this hole in the wall dump .
this is the closet i 've come , much to my disappointment .
in my phoenix and dragon i had five `` jumbo '' shrimps .
which are really just average sized shrimp .
some one else mentioned in this that they do n't really have much crab .
i suppose the worst part was delivery time .
the confirmation email does n't come with a estimated delivery .
_num_ minute mark rolls around and we have n't gotten a call .
_num_ minutes later we 're still waiting .
a little less than _num_ minutes later and it arrives .
the driver apologized and it was still hot .
the food was so dry .
no taste .
no flavor .
so bland .
have to say i wo n't be ordering here again .
the food i received from china wok was dry and tasteless .
it was unprofessional and annoying to other residents of our building .
i wo n't order from here again , ever .
disgusting !
half way through there was a hair in my sub .
i will not go back to this place again .
bad business , bad service .
place is trashy ... so is the guy whose family owns the place .
this place is truly awful .
visited last saturday evening and nothing was `` good '' .
the food was very meh ... _num_ people dined .
the potato skins were so dried out they were mostly inedible .
not too thrilled with the value of a groupon from sports pub .
that was not the case .
biggest waste of $ _num_ i 've ever spent .
you really should n't even think of going here during lunch .
they have one cash register at the front of the store .
nothing more , nothing else .
i was really dissatisfied that not one was hot enough to eat .
i physically left my whole meal and tray on the table and walked out .
no amount of ketchup could make me eat it .
i will probably not go back to this location again .
this is the worst fast food franchise in town .
the drive through is slow .
the food is inconsistent .
worst bk i 've ever been to .
when i left the car behind me followed as well .
it does n't matter the time of day .
ordered chicken tenders they were out .
ok can we have four cheeseburgers no we are out of buns .
i ordered sausage croissant meal w coffee to go .
sigh .
boy , did i regret doing that favor for her .
the employees seem slow , stupid , and lazy .
like they have no idea what they are doing .
running out of fries ?
looked online and saw it opens at _num_ am on weekdays .
they should close it down at this point .
the old kind .
never eaten here .
cash only and they 're out of fries .
not a big deal , but did n't have cash .
second time i pull up , drive thru box is still broken !
i wait _num_ minutes to get to the window to order .
i wait three more minutes before driving away .
madison public health department had burger king hire a pest control company .
i , for one , will never be eating here .
so bizarre .
_num_ .
customer service that is apathetic at best , rude at worst .
i just do n't care much today . ''
no eye contact , no smile .
this is typical of the service .
_num_ .
i was n't too bothered , as it rang up clearance price .
the fabric selection is not what it once was , either .
a store is pretty much worthless if you cant pay for the items .
so not a great visit but not the worst , either .
horrible customer service .
did n't want to spend time on me because of people behind me .
continued doing nothing .
i wo n't return to this location .
she was a counter waiting to get cut .
much better burgers and sandwiches in madison for a much more reasonable price .
overall , one of the worst restaurant experiences for me .
staff was friendly and service was fairly prompt .
the food was merely average and the `` specially brewed '' beer was weak .
overall , the place tries too hard with its theme .
not a day to encourage diners to eat on the patio .
i got so sick and was throwing up after eating there !
and normally i never get sick to my stomach .
no , no , never , never , uh uh uh !
sorry to say , this place is a disaster .
the food was cold , overcooked , tasteless and a little scary .
if i could give no stars this would be the place that deserves it .
there were a handful of patrons ( certainly more staff than paying customers ) .
disgusting !
do n't waste you time here !
cheeseburger was not all that .
it was disgusting .
the sweet potato chips were n't much better ; too greasy and stale .
it was acceptable , but the taste was off .
the service was n't good either .
i will not be back .
i was sick for _num_ days after i eat one of their burgers .
instead , all they serve up here is hamburgers with fancy names .
i doubt it was a chef .
if you 're looking for paradise you wo n't find it here .
but i have had lame burgers there too .
if you are still reading ... .
i had the mini crab burgers and they were pretty good .
service was mediocre .
however , i was surprised by the reasonable beer selection and the nice menu .
the big problem with cheeseburger was the service .
finish eating , wait _num_ minutes for the check .
not going back , even though the food was fine .
greasy food , lazy service , flat soda .
for a place the is supposed to specialize in burgers they sucked !
i got the guacamole bacon burger .
it was tasty but the burger itself was overly greasy .
the drink service was incredibly slow , and the food service was okay .
a disappointing trip , and we likely wo n't be back anytime soon .
do n't waste your money or time .
it was horrible .
awful , sums up my first impression of the place .
how hard is it to wipe off the booth .
portions are weak however .
a big mac would probably be as flavorful as the burgers served here .
first was the lack of caring when it came to the booth 's cleanliness .
second , i never got a refill on my soda .
for $ _num_ , i 'm sure jimmy could afford another glass of soda .
it took our waitress nearly _num_ minutes to collect come back with our bill .
she then acted annoyed that we did n't want something other than water !
i will not be coming back .
also , why close the bar _num_ minutes early ?
i 'm just beyond put off .
nobody was cleaning up the place !
our food was barely edible .
stay away from this restaurant until they fix their issues .
so the food was average , not great .
the service was rushed and unfriendly .
not worth the price .
disappointing .
however , the dishes we got were n't particularly good either .
skip this place .
i wish i could give this place no stars .
disgusting !
got sick from this place twice !
pretty unfortunate event ... .
worst italian we have ever had .
called to get takeout and was greeted by a nasty host .
we will never return to this restaurant for food .
horrible service , and sub-par food .
my stuff was stolen from my room .
going to file a police report .
pet friendly and low cost .
it 's ok for low cost , but keep your expectations low .
worst red roof inn i have ever stayed in .
bed comforter had dried stains on it as well .
it was absolutely gross .
if i could , i would give this place zero stars .
the front desk attendant was dead inside , and the room was absolutely disgusting .
we stayed here for _num_ nights this weekend .
our bathroom was disgusting .
it also was extremely slow .
do not stay here .
no idea !
it certainly was n't clean though .
i also have no idea what was in the water .
i 'm beyond upset with red roof inn , madison .
please do not stay here .
the service is so annoying .
april _num_ i entered boston store in east town mall in madison wisconsin .
i said `` why do n't you have locks on the dressing room doors ?
she had no response to my question .
i believe this is every woman 's worst nightmare !
she did n't seem to care .
he may have known there were no locks and followed me into dressing room .
odd smell .
very disappointed .
it was sub par and i returned it anyways .
doubt i 'll be back .
poor food handling practices !
i was really excited to try this place as the reviews were excellent .
major disappointment !
we ordered a couple of beers and they were prompt but not really cold .
they looked like they had never been washed .
last i checked , those practices could send someone to the hospital !
we will not be going back !
i think i may have been wrong .
the show was good enough but everything else was just meh .
let 's begin with the parking situation .
there is no parking situation .
i think i am going to stick to that for this venue as well .
the seats are cramped and uncomfortable .
do n't even want to mention the bathrooms , dirty taps and awful popcorn .
but my biggest beef of all is the lack of reserved seating .
why make people wait outside for an hour or more to attend an event .
sorry , it is just stupid .
worst security at any venue i have ever experienced and way overpriced drinks .
$ _num_ for a double ?
personally , i will not be attending any other performances here .
i needed new glasses , so prescription in hand i went shopping for frames .
not quite .
will not use them again .
if i could give zero stars i would .
Neutral
i am very disappointed that my review today has to to be negative .
i returned a car today at hertz at the madison airport .
she could care less and was extremely rude .
i have never been treated so horribly before .
well , go here if you want inconsistent pricing and condescending management .
edit - the less expensive store was the highly rated park street location .
i have never been so poorly treated by any business , ever .
i will not be returning to any midas location ever again .
pain in the neck , right ?
the tech put the bulb in and apparently it blew almost instantly .
_num_ .
_num_ .
that 's just not right .
stayed on a business trip seeking to save money on the nightly rate .
skip the complimentary breakfast as the choices are slim and offerings looked old .
good location , low prices , below par rooms .
my room was dirty .
the rooms had a stale , mildew smell .
ugh .
my blanket has burn holes in it .
breakfast was crappy and there are always shady people in the parking lot .
Neutral
negative stars .
the service , however , needs help , literally .
the small staff could just not get people to tables quickly enough !
everyone was working hard , they just need more people !
we drank too much coffee with all this waiting .
it was pretty busy so we waited for maybe _num_ minutes before being seated .
horrible service .
$ _num_ off our bill .
worst experience in service we 've ever had !
manager is very inexperienced .
fix your wifi for _num_ stars .
the jambalaya and gumbo seemed blah to both of us .
obviously the cook does not know that .
nothing had a cajun seasoning to it .
they are probably fake reviews by friends .
owner says i am not cajun .
i , on the other hand had an absolutely pitiful shrimp po boy .
take a bite , and all you taste is bread .
it was ok buy upset my stomach .
cornbread was dense and moist ?
flavorless though .
can i give zero stars ?
i did n't even get to eat .
we were very disappointed and will not be going back .
but not spectacular .
cashier was not friendly at all .
if yelp allowed no stars , that would be my rating for this motel .
my stay here was horrible .
the rooms were gross and the entire experience was uncomfortable .
i tried to contact corporate about it , but my concerns were ignored .
my stay was on feb _num_ , _num_ .
the receptionist was no help .
after trying several times , we requested a third room .
it was too late and we were tired so we just settled .
extremely disappointed .
Very negative
i wish yelp allowed negative stars .
if i was n't so tired i would of headed someplace else !
i could n't get out of this hole fast enough !
the decor was bland , to say the least .
i had selected motel _num_ based on my experience in california .
anything else i 've tired here has been sub-par .
the mushrooms in our enchilada were canned , and then burned .
they tasted like kool-aid ( but without adequate water ) and lacked tequila .
pedro 's was , unfortunately , the first place that i tried .
the food is edible , but it is by no means mexican .
all their food is canned process nonsense .
does anyone in madison consider this a great mexican food location ?
_num_ .
friends invite me for inexpensive margaritas .
_num_ .
uh huh , that 's right , i said it .
that is , your cheesy , americanized mexican food experience .
i tried the vegetarian tamale and it was nothing less than awful .
no cheese anywhere , no flavor , just hot .
unfortunately on this particular visit we did n't get a hot waitress .
no sour cream on my burrito as ordered but we 'll move on .
i could n't even finish my meal it was so boring and tasteless .
tamales were not good .
when i said no , my satisfaction was not questioned .
the west side location was way better .
half the time i 'm there they screw up my order .
avoid this place .
server was really slow and did not seem to know the menu .
the dining area is extremely shabby : ripped cushions and dingy tables .
i do not know why i stayed after the first five minutes .
the food is microwaved and tastes like it came out of a box .
in short , the food left much to be desired .
warning : do not waste your money on this place !
terrible service !
absolute worst mexican food i have ever eaten , period .
it 's like mexican food for people who do n't like mexican food .
i would rather eat taco bell , and i do n't like taco bell .
i tried the camarones wrap - big mistake .
the shrimp were barely warm and slimy .
so try the table guac , but give the shrimp wrap a pass .
so like i say , good news , bad news .
the decor is _num_ 's `` americanized mexico . ''
unfortunately , the machine was n't running .
they had been sitting out for awhile .
that was a bit disappointing .
i had a burrito , it was ok .
nothing too exciting .
however , that probably is n't enough to bring me back again anytime soon .
badger game disappointment !
watered down drinks , slow service and rude management !
tonight was a completely different story !
my guinness tasted just like water , i suspect it was watered down .
our service was super slow .
we were there for over _num_ minutes before we received chips and salsa .
my cousin asked for sour cream and waited another _num_ minutes for it .
it needed spice though .
he clearly does n't care about his customers !
my fault for ordering mashed potatoes at a mexican restaurant .
bad service .
waiter was rude and obnoxious .
the chimichangas were on point though .
service was adequate , no more no less .
i will not go back .
sadly , the beer i was served was not moon man .
at one point , the bartender went from merely okay to completely unprofessional .
terrible customer service .
if you want decent mexican food , go elsewhere .
if you are craving a margarita , go elsewhere .
avoid .
i was here to watch the super bowl and the setup was not bad .
_num_ big tv 's to watch the game .
some free food and i believe they had $ _num_ pints .
then she never went out of her way .
ordered the fried ice-cream and it had no outer shell on it .
never did she ask not offer to fix it .
just look at facebook to find out they had a list of specials .
it 's not this place .
never going here again .
disappointment number one : the tortillas were dry and tasteless .
disappointment number two : the salsa was really sweet and thick .
it did n't taste fresh .
disappointment number three : the rice was so dry that it was almost crispy .
i was served a fried tortilla filled with plain shredded chicken and nothing else .
wo n't be coming back unfortunately .
oh and the tortillas and butter are n't free anymore , btw .
no more chances .
only reason for two stars due to extremely small portion .
ordered baked fish for $ _num_ .
smallest portion of fish i 've ever had at a fish fry .
but this time around , the food was a huge disappointment .
im guessing the dough was sitting out and getting old .
she was the only good thing about the whole experience .
again , no complaints for this arrangement .
the sauce was watery and had almost no flavor .
i 'm still thirsty just thinking about it .
the price is right - but i 'm just not into bland food .
meh , very mediocre food .
it had the consistency of paste and tasted horrible .
nothing surprising here .
the restaurant decor is out dated and worn out .
poor service below average breakfast and how do you even screw up breakfast .
food did not have quality flavor it was very bland .
the restroom was gross .
my breakfast was _num_ % correct .
as the yelp _num_ star rating says : meh .
waitress gives you wrong food then says you ordered wrong .
waitress tells me no , i ordered scrambled .
waitress comes back to tell me that i 'm wrong and walks away .
the coffee was pretty good and the service was decent if not overwhelming .
waitress gives you wrong food then says you ordered wrong .
i got some weird dish with hash browns in my pancakes and scrambled eggs .
i have never been treated so rudely by a server .
this place is awful .
i really hate the selection here and the prices are higher than other 's .
so i guess there 's that .
it had more salt than you 'd find in food at mcdonalds .
the meat in the pot roast tasted processed .
the dumplings were slimy .
the vegetables were so salty , they were inedible .
got _num_ slices of soggy french toast .
the egg was n't even cooked on it !
potatoes and grits were very bland .
food was horrible .
service was mediocre .
atmosphere was alright .
service was super slow even though half the tables were empty .
our food took about _num_ min and tasted like crap .
disgusting .
the broccoli was good at least and the only thing i actually ate .
i wo n't be going back .
come in here quite a bit by myself , usually later in the evenings .
the special french toast strawberry cream cheese special was terrible .
maybe _num_ half strawberries and a bland cream cheese mix on french toast .
was totally embarrassed because we told our friends what a great place this was .
not going back .
not always reliable .
i 'm so disappointed in union cab .
i almost missed my flight and will not be taking union cab again .
if i could give them _num_ reviews i would .
sorry that is not our problem .
so i expected a discounted price given the shared nature .
but no , i was still charged a flat rate of $ _num_ .
unfortunately , that ride was with union cab .
but then when _num_ minutes rolled around there was still no cab in sight .
i wish i 'd thought to get his cab number before leaving .
i wo n't make the mistake of using union cab again .
i am not impressed by their lack of concern for safety .
he constantly rolled his eyes and treated me as a stupid individual .
i would sooner walk everywhere then ever deal with this place again .
i wish they would be more consistent with their overall service .
first , the sandwich was exceptionally greasy .
second , the size of the burger was pathetic .
you 've got to be desperate to eat there .
i could n't even eat it .
it 's disappointing for the north side of town .
there are n't many options for `` fast '' food .
what a waste !
just like every other home depot .
do n't buy paint here , it 's really inconsistent .
wait no , here 's the deal .
i stayed here with my fiance for a night a couple of saturdays ago .
not a good thing .
the only reason i put one star is because i had to .
there were crumbs in the bed and they were n't very clean .
management was the worst of all .
so overall , easy to make a better choice anywhere else .
one push on my wheelchair and i was across the room .
not to worry .
so the highlight of the room comes when u r passed out and asleep .
going out to breakfast in the lobby is disgusting .
the exercise equipment did n't work properly .
the continental breakfast food did n't look good so i opted to eat elsewhere .
the cleaning staff kept leaving their cleaning supplies in my room .
as soon as we told the server what we wanted the service went downhill .
server said she needed my card and would have to talk to the manager .
nothing spectacular but then nothing terrible either .
the atmosphere is typical of the chain , and kept clean enough .
the only downside was the waiter .
huge mistake .
very expensive & the food is terrible .
we will not return to this chili 's location .
the `` bottomless '' salad never had an offer of a refill .
the server was nice but it was a disappointing meal .
also they have a horrible time having things in stock .
it 's my own fault for continuing to frequent this grocery store .
rarely are there any baskets for shoppers to use .
their is no mobile service so we can call home for last minute items .
the prepared food counter looks horrendous .
and they are frequently out of things they normally carry .
they 're terrible .
the produce section is the worst of the store .
something about this location just seems off .
my latest trip sealed the deal .
so , so long .
not okay .
pricey and bad quality service .
only one stylist working and no receptionist .
i went because i got a flat .
my boyfriend drops off my bike on a monday .
the also say they 're going to lube the brake lines .
he says that they seem to have totally forgotten about the bike .
my flat is fixed .
$ _num_ dollars .
there were no problems with the brakes when we gave the bike to them .
the guy running the show takes about _num_ seconds .
at this point , i am so angry i can barely see straight .
there 's nothing wrong with them .
wanted to support the neighborhood bike shop , but it was horrible experience .
hell , even santa shows up there now .
they ruin every , single trip to the mall .
not exactly an upscale mall by a long shot .
there are just no good stores there .
until then , there is no point in shopping here .
also , the food court sucks .
no good eatery places here at all .
just ... nothing .
hmm , this mall needs a facelift .
the stores are awful .
i do not even walk down certain area .
a pedi place and a foot massage place next door to one another ?
i just do not know what else to say .
not so much anymore .
sorry to say i wo n't support this mall any longer .
this time around was n't so great .
i could n't convince the owner of using dry cloths .
they have hardly any business - i wonder why ?
i do n't get my car cleaned ( inside ) on a regular basis .
it hardly looked like i just got my car cleaned .
will not be going here to throw away my money .
this place is the worst .
and the employees are rude .
i would not come back here if it was free .
`` ummmm , what kinds are there ? ''
then , you drive around , then , you pull up like normal .
awkward and offensive .
i pay my $ _num_ bucks , and go out to get my car .
i get in , and it looks like nothing was touched .
i just got this car _num_ weeks ago !
needless to say , i 'm really bummed and disgusted .
the employees are rude .
the product is over priced .
the people are rude !
no hello , no hi , how are you ?
but that is not a reason for employees to be rude to the customers .
the guys vacuuming out the cars got really rude with her .
the epitome of a crap chain .
why did i get talked into going here ?
this needs no explanation .
terrible !
wasted $ _num_ .
the sirloin was mostly fat and rubbery .
there was no meat to be eaten .
i really did not expect the food to be so bad .
the only good part was my daughter 's chicken fingers , fries and pepsi .
last time i went i was very disappointed in the service .
waiting for a table is common unless you go at really off peak times .
was offered something else , but the others i was with were already done .
did get a coupon for a return visit .
mozzarella sticks were barely warm .
the coleslaw served with it was literally inedible .
little to no dressing and tasteless .
i am not a fan of false advertisement !
i broke a rule : never eat at chain restaurants .
the minute i walked thru the door ... .
i do n't get it .
it 's not that hard to give a customer good service .
waited _num_ minutes , and no service .
we got up , walked out and nobody said a word or noticed .
i would avoid coming here .
this would n't even be one star for me .
no body came out so i went to the door and it was locked .
that was five minutes of trying to figure out where i can get in .
after i walk in , the bar area was filled , restaurant portion wasnt .
but that was n't the end of it .
i grabbed a piece of chicken out to try and it was completely cold !
the nachos were cold and soggy and the chicken was super cold .
i ate what i could then went to bed shortly after .
it was terrible .
my husband and i went in to attempt to have lunch .
when we entered they were not busy at all ... kind of dead really .
it was horrible from the get go .
it took our sever _num_ min before she even acknowledge our table .
and then she brought our salads and no silverware .
my wife had to get up and get some from the host .
my entree looked like it was under the heat lamp for _num_ min .
the course maintenance has really gone downhill over the last couple of years .
what a shame , because this course used to be a very nice facility .
the `` cart paths '' were awful !
if i could give less than one star , i would !
how are your employees not well trained enough to read a calendar ?
not just one but two employees .
restaurant manager said no problem .
manager gone - staff no clue we were coming .
it was $ _num_ for a bucket of balls .
dirty as all hell .
and yes someone can contact me if they 'd like .
i 've never been more dissatisfied with such customer service .
it was that bad .
not sure when or if i will go back .
this used to be a favorite .
very disappointed .
i wish they would go back to the old style of burgers .
one of the worse hotels i have stayed at in a long time .
this hotel is disgusting .
we should have spent more money and got a nicer place .
really disappointed .
this last stay of _num_ nights was a different story .
the first night we had loud and rude neighbors .
i will not be staying here again .
this hotel did not live up to even those minimal standards .
i was very disappointed in this hotel .
would not stay there again and would not recommend it to you .
no one cleaned our room .
however , my husband woke up with some kind of bug bites .
we wo n't be staying there again .
very cheap place ... in a bad way .
no conditioner , no lotion ... not impressed at all .
the bed was comfortable .
the sink allows plenty of room for toiletries .
ridiculous , i 'll take my tailoring needs elsewhere from now on .
if i could 've put zero stars , i would have .
it 's horrible .
let me wet it down . ''
she did , then she handed me my glasses and said , `` okay !
do not go to this place .
do n't lie to customers .
to begin with , they have only two chairs in the waiting area .
not good .
where i wanted it to go down , it goes up .
where i wanted it to go up , it goes down .
they do n't seem to blow dry after a standard haircut .
i paid $ _num_ for a manicure and it was not good .
nice employees , but it was definitely not worth the money .
i want to like this place but ca n't .
i went today and the did not have chicken .
i usually give people the benefit of the doubt but it was pretty bad .
this place has gone downhill .
the staff is slow and the orders are rarely correct .
they post hours til _num_ am on weekends but are rarely open past _num_ .
just go further down east wash if you need a crappy taco fix .
this used to be my favorite taco bell in the madison area .
if it happened to us twice , surely it 's happened to someone else .
gross !
i assume somebody got there late .
understaffed , slow , and disorganized .
there is another taco bell down east washington .
you 're better off going down the street .
after a _num_ minute wait , i inquired where my food was .
_num_ minutes later , still no food .
they lost my ticket again ?
the workers also gave me an extra fountain drink .
worst taco bell in the area .
honestly so annoying .
they mess up our order almost every time .
the lobster was not fresh , it was tough and very chewy .
my boyfriend and i visited for the first time ever on thursday .
however , our waiter was extremely rude .
i 'm assuming it was our age , but that should n't matter .
it made the entire experience quite disappointing .
even the salads are iffy .
their food is nothing special .
my last two visits there were very disappointing .
the food was bland .
that was frustrating .
the beer selection was very poor .
no local taps are offered .
the cheddar biscuits were heavily salted , almost to much to handle .
we had the crab linguine , and it to was overly salted .
the crab could n't even be tasted , as the salt overwhelmed everything .
all the food was terribly disappointing .
overall , this made for a rather miserable and expensive evening .
first and probably last time i dine at this red lobster location .
restaurant half empty and food took _num_ minutes .
came in at dinner time and it was quite busy .
why did it take _num_ minutes for our food to get there ?
even the cooks messed up the steak order at the table next to us .
i 'm giving a _num_ star rating because the service was ... awkward .
rather than get sick i pushed the plate away , barely touched .
the cheddar biscuits were way to salty and i love salt .
i 'll make that drive next time i need my lobster fix .
_num_ star for the salty biscuits is a 1/2 star too much .
they just ignored us so we said we would just go somewhere else !
i ate here with my wife recently .
so why not give it a shot .
surprisingly , we did n't have to wait long to get our seats .
i know the servers have to do it , but i found it annoying .
no big deal .
i told the server and he promptly brought out a different house salad .
my steak was rather bland .
when the bill came , it said waters w/ lemon .
everyone has off days , i get it .
a number of points during the experience rubbed me the wrong way .
service was slow .
my fries came out about _num_ minutes after my entree did .
the shrimp was over battered and the fries were over cooked .
i would n't eat here again .
oh dear , you guys ... .
block is just awful !
horrible in fact !
so very , very bad !
i wo n't be back .
but for us , it was a complete and utter disaster .
we were wrong !
we went around _num_ and waited _num_ min or so for a table .
we could have walked out ... and almost did without paying .
no carry out on friday nights !
our food was just so ... terrible .
plus , they did n't even provide a leaf of lettuce or tomato .
i do n't care how good the food is or the beer selection .
not going back .
went for lunch had the fish fry .
really bad over cooked just bad .
i so wanted to like this place .
no drink menu on the table and the server did n't mention a thing .
the italian beef was very dry almost jerky .
pros : the beer , casual atmosphere , and garlic chile fries .
cons : confused servers , bad burger buns , smokers on the patio .
my husband 's walleye was not so excellent .
so not a good first experience .
i schedule a _num_ hr appt .
my oil change took over _num_ minutes .
why should i wait _num_ minutes on a routine oil change ?
there was nothing unusual about my car or the service i was requesting .
i am unimpressed , and found the customer service unacceptable .
they didnt bother to apologize or give any explanation either .
there are much better and cheaper places to get your oil changed in madison .
i love noodles but this location is going downhill fast .
is there a broccoli shortage ?
i got _num_ thinly sliced pieces .
maybe _num_ sticks .
there is no shortage for noodles though .
such a contrast to the sleeping counter person .
no one jumped on to help him out .
i really miss the west side location , they were on top of it .
in the past _num_ weeks i have been here _num_ times .
the food has been very below this company 's standards .
he was n't doing anything and it was not busy by any means .
i was the only person standing there waiting for my food .
there were several other employees that looked at the bag and said nothing .
terrible customer service !
we will not be back !
the place is run down and the machines are old .
i will never be going back .
i freaked out , grabbed my wet clothes , and ran out of there .
when i got home i realized i 'd left clothes in another dryer .
completely scary , awful experience .
mind you , it was 4:30 p.m. on a monday .
i asked what time they close tomorrow , he said , `` 8:30 '' .
`` no , we 've got to go . ''
he offered no explanation , and i did n't bother to ask why .
before leaving , i checked their website .
do n't say you are returning a gift .
hey east side , get a clue .
only wish i could give them _num_ stars .
significantly peeling off the walls .
i could go on , but i 'm sure you get the point .
get your wallet out !
i buy a room for a night and a conference room for a day .
this hotel really sticks it to their priceline customers .
just stayed here for one night and it was passable .
it 's just a bit dated and tired looking .
but charge me twice before i even attempted to check out ?
gross hotel !
nasty carpeting .
very old furniture .
horrible experience .
upper management should be ashamed to have not upgraded the rooms years ago .
she replied that she would call downstairs to send someone up .
there are six pieces of fruit put out on the front desk each morning .
you 've been warned .
the air handling is so terrible , i truly can not warn you enough .
i am not able to hold my breath long enough to tolerate the stench .
used hotwire to find a last minute deal when traveling through madison .
the room was pretty rough .
the light over the mirror did n't work .
things were just worn out .
the bed had clearly seen better days .
the room had big stains on carpet .
the free wifi was completely unreliable and cut off every five to seven minutes .
the tub drain did not work and could n't be a new issue .
stay elsewhere if you have a choice .
simply awful .
old , needs remodeling .
air did n't work correctly in the bedroom area .
really disappointed .
apparently ac only works if light is on and you move around .
ancient stained plastic toilet seat .
coffee at the breakfast buffet tastes like it was out of said toilet .
i stayed here hoping for something better than the motel _num_ down the road .
did n't get it .
wish i had checked yelp before coming .
horrible service .
nearly _num_ minutes later our drinks showed up .
at $ _num_ for a taco , the price was awesome .
this place was gross and depressing .
we live nearby , but i will avoid ever going back .
some of staff good others could care less .
but as you may know , bigger is not necessarily better .
these burgers are n't seasoned and are quite bland .
a little salt and pepper would help a lot .
they were chewy and gross .
the burger buns were n't so much toasted as burnt .
all _num_ of us were pretty underwhelmed .
the bar itself is a pretty typical wisconsin dive bar .
there were only a few others in there around _num_ pm on a sunday .
tell me what i need , tell me how to care for things .
they should n't even allow carts throughout because it 's too cramped .
the disease spread to other pepper plants that i purchased from elsewhere .
service was atrocious .
another _num_ before our orders were taken and drinks brought .
not cool .
two adults and one kid equals a _num_ dollar meal .
it 's not like we ordered everything on the menu either .
the service was horrible .
the bathrooms were nasty dirty , next time i 'll just hold it .
out of a can , bag , box , or freezer .
parking is very limited .
not a fan .
this is probably the worst ihop i have ever been to in my life .
i 'd rather cook my own breakfast than eat here .
i was seated and given a menu , and that is where it ended .
cause she saw the mean looks on our faces .
the manager should be fired as well as the entire staff .
only 2-3 tables were being used .
part of my omelette was cold when i received it .
this place is dirty , and disgusting .
food is poor quality .
service is terrible !
Neutral
if i could give negative stars i would !
horrible service !
the two guys working there are so rude .
internet sucks which is why i wo n't be back .
service was ok , wireless internet is unreliable .
by far the worst place i stayed when i drove across the country .
it was not cheap and the room was gross .
the bed was the worst thing i have ever slept on .
i did not feel safe here .
would not come back here .
if you have a pet , go stay at a super _num_ .
far past the expiration date ; _num_ .
poor quality ; _num_ .
stale .
almost a full month past expiration !
fortunately , we did n't eat the hummus .
unfortunately , we discovered the tortillas had expired in the middle of dinner .
it 's incredibly disappointing too , when you 're looking forward to good bread .
then there 's the deli , where there 's been a few issues .
it was slimy , chewy , tough , flavorless , & ultimately inedible .
this particular deli meat however , was a few steps beyond .
however , he did so without gloves & without washing his hands .
service ... not so good .
food ... not so good .
they also had a salad bar that accompanied the fish fry .
horrible service in the bar .
rude and inattentive bartenders even though it was n't busy .
the service we got was the worst we both have ever experienced .
which is unfortunate because the fish was actually decent .
food was average , service terrible , drinks flat .
this week was a disaster .
salad lettuce was limp and sitting out way too long .
waitress nowhere to be found .
waitress was clueless .
_num_ tries and still ca n't get a simple pizza order right !
hold the phone , this is n't what i ordered .
i dunno if i was expecting too much but this certainly did not deliver .
first and foremost , she is not friendly at all .
she made me feel rushed and took away from the moment .
unfortunately , it did n't fit properly .
zero customer appreciation !
she 's the professional that was hired because she said she could do it .
the end result , the dress was too tight .
never will i go there again , or would i recommend her services !
stopped in because i was nearby and did a search for close coffee shops .
looked like a cool place , however the service was pretty poor .
i will never be back .
this place it not worth the reputation .
somebody teach these people some customer service .
i am consistently disappointed when i visit monty 's .
a companion ordered a plain cheeseburger and it was loaded with onions .
another companion got the german chocolate cake which was also dry .
cooking school _num_ will tell you the bun will fall apart .
i 'm not terribly impressed with it .
i could probably get better breakfast somewhere else .
its not amazing food .
is it just me or is it always cold in there ?
gross , disgusting , rip-off .
i have no reason to set foot in this place .
but the food quality is generally average to poor .
do n't waste the time or money , many better options around town .
it completely ruined the dish and my want to ever come back .
not to mention that the food is always mediocre .
not happy and not coming back .
wanted to order fish and was told they no longer served it .
the food that we got was not that great this time anyway .
the host at the counter was not friendly .
gross .
nothing special , just some plain old ice cream and say , caramel .
milk , ice cream , caramel ?
just checking ... smh ... whoa , what ?
wait ... did they just charge me like that much for this ?
i do n't even know why people like this place .
i do n't understand why this place is popular .
the food was bad and the service was bad .
my friend ordered a breakfast dish and it was terrible .
no one was unfriendly , just incompetent .
there 's tons of better restaurants in the area and in the city .
never going back , and i think the food has made me ill .
some ok food , some terrible .
recently it has been just ok .
everything about this place was mediocre .
the food was mediocre , the ambiance was mediocre and the service was mediocre .
i would not call it special or extraordinary , but it is not bad .
the service is less than desirable .
last friday i went there for another shake and it was really thin .
$ _num_ is way too much for a watery shake .
while waiting i had to use the restroom -- disgusting .
when we finally got a table , service was rushed and impersonal .
it seemed totally chaotic and like nobody was in charge .
lunch was okay , but nothing special .
will not be back .
the host was friendly and despite being busy , they sat us quickly .
i ordered chicken pot pie with mashed potatoes .
both of which were really dry .
eggs where overlooked .
drinks sat empty most of our visit .
it 's all fine , but not special at all .
_num_ mins later and we were finally seated .
unbelievably bad service and only a weak apology are n't going to cut it .
my friend had the zucchini potatoes pancakes which were incredible .
every time i go there it 's just so mediocre .
i do n't know what anyone likes about this place .
that 's not what i want to pay for .
what really went wrong was when i ordered the vegan sweet potato hash .
she took the plate away but offered no real apology for the mistake .
however she still charged me for my coffee ... .
wow , _num_ stars ?
but my room smelled like stale smoke and the desk was really small .
front desk was rude and not helpful whatsoever .
it 's filthy ... do n't sit on anything .
terrible service .
actually no service .
it was nearly empty ... easy to see why .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
this place is just dirty .
Negative
for every positive interaction i have , i have two negatives ones .
_num_ .
the salesperson said i could pick from any four .
it was weird .
_num_ .
nothing happened to it .
the lady at the counter was so rude .
we did not have our receipt and could not find it in their system .
but she needed a person from paint to approve it .
no one asked us anything .
_num_ .
it was ridiculous .
the garden department is rather large as is my list .
hey , i get it .
stopped in here after breakfast at denny 's next door .
walked through the store to the service desk .
as everyone in madison knows , there are no doughnut chain stores around .
no krispy kreme .
no dunkin donuts .
yelp and the restaurant itself states that this establishment is open until _num_ pm .
lights were out , nobody home .
i ordered the spinach with rice dish , and my husband got the gyro .
i could n't even stomach a few bites .
the gyro was a gyro , nothing great , nothing terrible .
such a disappointment .
very bland & the crust ... just no .
the teenagers even thought it was mediocre .
i have a coupon for free _num_ inch pizza when purchasing _num_ inch pizza .
boo shame on them .
i ordered a stuffed ( pie ) pizza for carryout .
while having a slice i found out that it was not even cooked completely .
at that point they lost me and it only got worse .
i know for a fact that this was not true .
he was even rude with his staff while we were there .
not a fan .
big mistake .
very messy and started to come off very quickly .
poor hours , selection and service .
just there 's not a lot of variety or selection .
i swear i 've never left this place not feeling awful .
the place reeked of old urine .
they would n't even refund our money for the fish we had bought .
she never gave advice as to why or what else can be done .
i would n't even put a star .
maybe they should teach their employees what they r talking about !
no way am i going back to them !
ur losing customers !
do the employee 's working here know how to stock the shelves ?
not everyone has a _num_ lb dog .
i 'm not even asking much .
however , the kitty was asleep so we were unable to see her personality .
such obvious bs .
, then told i could chose from the board .
but this has been my experience .
also , the food was a big disappointment .
ever since caf royale took over the scene , the coffee is not fantastic .
i do n't come here anymore - bad vibes .
friend said that it is not her experience ... maybe a bad make .
not impressed .
we have had a terrible customer service experience with this place .
horrible service .
unacceptable .
unless , you want to have terrible service and regret about your money .
can not believe it !
this place is horrible for service .
another week went by and we heard nothing .
we finally talked to him and he said there was no gas leak .
the motor had a leak and was covered under warranty .
look at all the bad reviews for this place .
i looked around and my boat was nowhere to be found .
i 've been sitting here for and hour and a half now and nothing .
absolute worst dry cleaners in madison .
i have had to return multiple shirts because they were not cleaned properly .
the new ownership has completely ruined that experience .
they have destroyed multiple shirts and the service is poor .
the new management is awful .
the turn around time is brutal and the customer service is even worse .
i would not recommend .
full of gristle , did n't taste good , etc .
when i complained to the owner , there was never a response .
aside from the johnny d 's the others all serve incredibly bad food .
terrible service .
i highly recommend not going here .
im still not sure i 'll go back .
i recently had my engagement pictures here .
ok still , we can hurry .
my fianc did not bc he did not feel comfortable .
and my photographer stayed to take pics with my ring .
i 've never been treated so terribly .
part of me really never wants to go back there ever again .
she needs a crash course on customer service .
bc she has zero .
she basically told us , `` no , '' _num_ different ways .
you end up with a slide off mess .
grease running down my hand .
sorry , pizza pit staff .
[ cue the tim & eric `` ya blew it ! ''
big mistake !
that was n't much better .
all in all , i will never return for a fish fry there .
i was utterly wrong .
i thought my cod was adequate but rather tasteless and in need at salt .
it tasted fishy and disgusting !
but , i 'll never be eating here again .
this place has really gone downhill .
fish fry was over cooked and greasy .
i really do n't see any greatness there .
not a fan .
have not had lunch or dinner here .
my wife and ate there tonight .
service not good .
wish i was told they did have lake perch .
after dinner drinks at the bar did n't go so well .
what a disappointment !
took forever to get seated , took even longer to get waited on .
the table was not completely cleared nor reset when we were seated .
the fish was n't much better , definitely not what we had hoped for .
salty , doughy breadsticks .
eggplant parmesan , greasy , boring cheese .
the red sauce , peppery but no substantial flavor .
chicken parmesan .
no , we are n't in italy .
i left full , but i can get full at mcdonald 's too .
americans do n't know the difference any more .
if i could not give any stars i would .
she only knew i couldnt do a saturday evening .
our main complaint was that it was hot in the restaurant .
we were tired and somewhat sad and looking forward to a nice dinner .
it did n't start well .
he just crowded the plates onto the table while we scrambled to make room .
i tasted it , and yup , tasted just like it looked .
i guess we 'll skip olive garden next time !
the soups were not as good either .
i have never had a bad experience with the food here .
instead we have _num_ awful ones and three mediocre .
i do not recommend this place .
they are charging for hot tea and pepper oil .
they have better service and half lower price for the better food .
i would not eat there again .
no fortune in the fortune cookie !
second bite into my chicken , and it 's hard .
no fortune .
disappointment .
the chicken was bad quality , i 've had much better .
prices were n't bad either .
i will not go to the restaurant again even in my dreams .
awful dirty place .
prices too high and service very slow .
save yourself lots of money and frustration and avoid this location .
went here today for a flat tire patch .
never again , goodyear !
terrible service .
he said they left the most worn tire up front with the new one .
do n't count on the people in this store to give you complete information .
the staff did not even attempt to address my needs .
i wish i could remember this one 's name .
i went back the next day and was served by rebecca .
she was unfriendly and never smiled !
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i was very disappointed at the service i got here .
my iphone is _num_ 1/2 years old and was turning off on me constantly .
i did n't drop it and never had problems before .
the worst cell phone experience of my life .
the sound was terrible and i spent more time outside than in .
mr. roberts has going for it .
drinks are reasonably priced too .
worst worst worst !
i got the pathetic haircut ever .
i felt so embarrassed .
most awful and horrible place to get a haircut .
quit going there .
i needed a quick haircut , so was pretty much forced to go here .
and this lady was rough .
i would not recommend going here .
the price is n't even right , at $ _num_ .
nobody even bothered to ask me if i was waiting for my appointment .
our bill was completely off .
however , we only got a refill on the water when the check came .
if this is a concern for you , consider a different restaurant .
starters were about $ _num_ and entrees were less than $ _num_ .
but , i would not come back for dinner .
the food was fair to poor , and the dog issue is unappetizing .
no longer dog friendly .
too bad for them !
i live _num_ blocks from the tip top .
cash only really sucks .
one of the worst kfc 's i have ever eaten at !
everything was dry .
the potatoes were watery , butter was rock hard .
avoid kfc at all costs !
the food quality is continuously horrible .
when i called and asked to speak to a manager no one spoke english .
i ca n't believe this place is still in business .
it 's always dead , like a ghost town .
i do n't recommend going around the dinner hour for sure .
you 've been warned .
beer selection is ok.
i was of age but not planning on drinking .
_num_ thumbs down .
extremely slow drink service .
each drink took about _num_ minutes to get to the table .
and i 'm not twelve .
portion was fine for the price , but was the salad ever bland .
three tiny croutons on top and flavorless cheese .
i wo n't be going back .
the sides were not good at all .
drinks way over priced !
it was shady business .
there was a better way to express their concerns , if they were legitimate .
turns out they would have charged me less for my breaks .
( that almost never happens ) just be careful and shop around .
where was the call before i dropped of as promised !
waste of my time .
left the car for them to check things out .
still i am not going back somewhere that pretty much almost threatened my life .
customer service is second to none .
yes this place is highly recommended for those looking for crap dentistry .
my consultant was ok , but not overly helpful .
and there has n't been much info .
still no idea when these blinds will arrive .
after initial order and down payment i never heard back from them .
communication was poor .
never had any kind of follow up call to see whether we were happy .
wo n't recommend and wo n't use them again .
ordering over the phone , everything seemed to go well .
she refunds me around _num_ bucks in cash to make up for the overcharge .
so i come back and begin with the ribs , 1/2 a slab .
from the first taste i was not impressed .
the fries dipped in the bbq sauce were the best part by far .
and i ordered fries and mashed potatoes , neither of which was included .
so the other part of my order was completely wrong in every respect .
and note , the chicken was not anything to write home about either .
was driving by madison and thought we 'd get some bbq .
that was it , not even a big chicken breast ?
it looked like it was from a grocery store .
i waited _num_ minutes .
i did n't have anymore time and asked them to check my order .
nope , the ticket was lost .
i was so hungry and so sad that i could n't get any ribs .
but at least i know she put my ticket into the kitchen .
unfortunately , i was disappointed .
the salad was just bagged romaine lettuce with dressing in a packet .
nothing could be farther from the truth !
really bad service worst attitude i 've seen .
and then again for game _num_ of the world series .
here 's what 's not : extremely inconsistent ribs .
why ca n't i get them on my dinner ?
the service has n't gotten any better here .
do n't go here if you do n't want to be threatened by him .
did n't want _num_ plates or anything else .
the ribs were very dry and the sides were very small .
you will not get great value here .
we did find parking on a side street , but not real convenient .
the friendly service is probably not enough to get us back for another visit .
the ribs are over cooked .
if you like bbq sauce , then this may be your spot .
i 'm still searching for good bbq meat in madison .
very frustrating experience .
our order was very simple but the cashier could n't get it right .
every customer had a problem with their food or order .
never again ... .
mediocre , really .
giving two stars only because the food was mediocre .
horrible customer service !
this time it was awful .
not going back .
the noodles were a bit dried out but the sauce was super yummy .
i 'll try again , but will more than likely dine-in and not drive-thru .
no way .
overall , this store is disappointing .
we have been buying our dog food from here for years .
they will no longer have my family 's business .
worst place ever !
my oldest died so i wanted to buy a kitten there .
they act like your stupid and know nothing about cats .
i told them i would n't come back and the could care less .
having said all this , my opinion of this store changed as of today .
i went into their store to get some dog food .
the groomer was not friendly at all .
she was n't too happy i had to go back to the grooming area .
i asked how long as my husband was picking her up .
never again will i visit this store .
my previous review was for an oil change , which i still stand by .
brought it by that morning and explained the brake problem i was experiencing .
got a call back with a $ _num_ estimate .
i just need a quote because i am shopping around .
this place is horrible .
they ripped me off so bad on an oil change and filter service .
the gyro meat was bland ... gyros are not meant to be bland !
if you want spinach pie , go to med cafe .
we had coffee , the sausage skillet , and the southern benedict .
all was edible , but nothing out of the common way .
food was terrible .
nothing was fresh , all processed or frozen .
service was n't the worst , but also not even as good as mediocre .
i will not be coming back .
they have an acoustics problem here .
it 's horribly loud in there , and everything feels rushed and crushed together .
clearly i was not the only one with this impression .
what i do not expect is to be treated rudely .
i later called panera and spoke with the manager dennis .
consider yourself warned .
this location needs new management and new employees .
always slow service .
staff never in a hurry .
nothing special to write about .
service just so so , food just ok and wifi horrible .
would not return to this one .
could n't even wait to get out of the restaurant to write this review .
update : finally got the smoothie _num_ minutes after we finished eating .
my order was about _num_ mins apart .
wait times for food have just gotten terrible .
once my go to lunch spot stinks for service .
someone in management needs to get a clue !
associate was helpful .
the rest of the experience , not so much .
the chair still has problems .
there was never any follow up from the madison store .
this purchase has turned in to an unfortunate experience .
the survey is time sensitive and we were unable to comment .
this purchase has turned in to an unfortunate experience .
the survey is time sensitive and we were unable to comment .
well , it has n't gotten any better .
there was a big saturday sale going on .
i was quoted $ _num_ for the chair .
they quoted the exact chair for $ _num_ .
i booked everything online and called to confirm .
i was told it was a _num_ % deposit .
next month i will be renting from any other company besides enterprise .
i landed less than _num_ minutes early and went to get my rental .
she offered no options -- -- no taxi service , etc .
awful does not begin to describe tonight 's experience .
wow - quite the rude encounter at enterprise rental at madison airport .
the place is not that bad , shoes seem a bit old but passable .
we had a very bad customer service experience .
this is unfortunate .
if i could select zero i would have .
nothing wrong with the bowling alley , the staff just sucks .
the staff are extremely rude and not very accommodating .
it kind of explains why nobody comes here .
the worst customer service i have ever experienced .
will never be going back to this place again .
worst service ever .
i want to give this dump a big fat _num_ .
the menu was extremely old , small and the coffee was pure water .
i order the walleye , hash browns , toast and eggs breakfast .
biscuit , gravy and hash browns ?
not only that but the server was horrible .
i felt like she ignored my mother and i the entire time .
she was a horrible waitress .
neither my mother or i could finish our food .
i took possibly _num_ bites and was done .
i told the cashier the food was horrible and i would n't be back .
you do no throw your co workers under the bus to customers !
just a horrible business , not friendly and food is beyond pathetic .
my car was no completed on time .
east side never fixed the problem but they were glad to keep my money .
all of the food is greasy , bland , and expensive .
i was there on a hot sat in june .
should n't the outside order window be opened .
if use a credit card you pay _num_ % more .
what a rude and disappointing experience .
the custard is ok , but nothing special .
for all the hype , michael 's is quite a disappointment .
that is ridiculous .
it was slow , disorganized , and not very friendly .
one of them just disappeared into a back room .
served with about _num_ french fries .
are you kidding me ?
$ _num_ for a milkshake ?
not to mention it was not much of a milkshake .
it was not very impressive whatsoever .
the hot dog was hot and the chili was warm .
i like that they have shredded cheese on it , rather than liquid cheese .
_num_ - my dining companion got a burger .
it tasted ok , but it was a very thing patty .
he also ordered cheese curds with it .
they were so greasy and lacked any good flavor in the breading .
not good .
not even worth the price !
did n't michael 's used to be good ?
to say i 'm disappointed is an understatement .
that should have been my first warning .
the bacon was okay , but there was n't enough of it .
the cheese was some processed crap .
the fries were equally frozen pieces of bland , tasteless crap .
i hate to make a fuss , so i did n't .
unless something changes , i think i 'm done with michael 's .
disturbing to say the least .
so far this company has been very disappointing .
it was supposed to be delivered on tuesday .
it was not .
it was not delivered on wednesday .
this is a terrible company .
Positive
if i could give negative stars i would .
this is an illegal and unethical business practice !
Negative
if i could give negative stars i would .
deserves zero stars .
worst customer service .
customer service is awful .
i 'm not even sure where to begin .
that quickly turned into an hour and a half .
the staff was really chaotic and unorganized .
there was literally almost no fish .
literally these are the words we just exchanged after getting home .
terrible .
no , the `` wedge '' was lettuce , carrots and bacon .
only gave them one star because zero was n't an option !
i had a very unpleasant experience with the owner of this business today .
when we got there nobody was there .
no phone call , no e-mail , nothing .
extremely disappointed .
not tonight .
for tonight , the feast of the dollars is upon us .
i asked again , and he had to go get his manager ?
the shelves were not stocked and there was stuff everywhere .
i was looking for a bath mat , a fan and some groceries .
the lighting was dim and very difficult to find what i needed .
there were employees walking around but no one was putting things on shelves .
the produce department was disgusting - moldy food , smelly .
i could n't believe it .
very disappointed .
i am a frequent walmart shopper .
they are completely inefficient , slow , lazy , and rude .
she was , just as the previous clerk , extremely slow and uncaring .
it took forever to get my stuff and get out of there .
however , the layout and design should have probably stayed in the _num_ 's .
was sent by one walmart to this walmart for the last of a product .
i grab another employee .
who spent _num_ minutes in the back searching for the wrong product !
this is a ridiculous game of cat and mouse and i 'm really unimpressed .
the money just seems to be needed to drive business i guess .
you will find better business elsewhere .
ordering the tires was ok .
after _num_ minutes , he said he was done .
unfortunately , my experience with this store did not end that day .
while filling it up , i could hear the air leaking out slowly .
firestone called tires plus and told them what happened .
one was horrible and one provided great customer service .
i had my oil changed here a few times and will never go again .
i was afraid because i didnt know what was wrong .
i 've been using priceline for _num_ years almost on a weekly basis .
my room is next to the elevator too .
this was neither .
really disappointed .
i walked in and there was a white lady getting her bike fixed .
the guy working there looked past me and serviced the white lady before me !
it was clear that i was next , but he did n't serve me .
i patiently waiting thinking something was strange .
he then asked me what i needed .
i explained and we walked to the pump .
he just left me standing there .
i walked back in the shop wondering what was going on .
he thanked me for my patience and went along .
... and he walked back in the store , leaving me by myself .
i 'm serious , i stood there shocked and wondering what was happening .
i did n't deserve service like this .
he did n't need to treat me with such disregard .
they do n't deserve your money .
stay away and tell your friends to not support this shop .
now , it 's all horrible .
cheese sticks were under cooked , the pizza was extremely greasy .
i mean , oil was literally dripping out of the crust .
gross .
first time great and reasonably priced for fries , boneless buffalo wings and dips .
no , really .
you 're kind of a disaster sometimes , man .
but just ... just get it together , dude .
do i need an artisan barbecue glaze on my crust ?
be greasy and awful and ridiculous , pizza hut .
when he explained his diagnosis he raised his voice at me for no reason .
that was enough for me to look elsewhere for auto repair .
julie was the consultant who helped me .
i then signed and returned with a _num_ % down payment .
what a customer service disaster .
avoid this place like the plague .
not cool .
clearly this company does n't work well with others .
dirty counters , messy machines , and dirty tables .
who knew you could mess up a blizzard so bad ?
no card , no money left their hand .
they are like , it is just brownies .
he ordered a turtle pecan blizzard and received some random peanuts in his blizzard .
when i asked for one , they said they did not have any .
more like gross .
and just walked away .
besides the poor service , the food standards were disgusting .
Neutral
they get a negative star !
this dq does not even deserve _num_ star .
no follow up .
gross .
they were out of pie pieces , okay fine .
tried it , it was discussing .
waste of $ _num_ .
by the looks of the other reviews the owner does n't give a crap .
this place was a waste of our time and money .
and the trainer seemed nice but did a crappy job at training .
seriously will never go back to this place .
please people do n't waste your time or money here !
absolutely the slowest service ever !
waited _num_ minutes for _num_ ice cream treats , extremely disappointed .
however it is always a hit or miss .
today was the worst pizza i have ever had .
my husbands also was just as bad .
did n't honor online prices from their own website .
the kid at the counter was clueless .
not pink or even a smoke ring , blood .
not cool .
they were busy ( which is great ) but they could not handle it .
ate here last night .
food was barely tolerable and the place was so dirty .
never going back .
this place is in need of some serious updating in all areas .
the inside of the restaurant was unclean and tacky .
neither my dad nor i were impressed with the food .
this is not a good thing .
not a lot of great variety .
i had the 1/2 rack of ribs with slaw and fries .
the slaw and fries were fine .
nothing special but not bad .
the ribs , on the other hand , could use some work .
sauce should provide an accent to good bbq , not be the bbq .
one rib was fall of bone .
further down , it was closer to jerky .
all in all , not a great bbq experience .
barely ok.
service was flat out terrible .
not even close to the best in madison .
the ribs were very dry and tough .
will not be going back .
it used to my favorite place for barbecue .
the cook said that happens sometimes and sent out two cold pieces of rib .
i tried a chicken leg first and all i could taste was smoke .
the breast was dry .
next i tried the ribs .
they were tender , but for some reason they tasted like sausage .
the baked beans were pretty good .
the coleslaw is what hurt .
bottom line is i 've had better bbq in the madison area .
we decided on the tuesday special - all you can eat chicken and ribs .
what a disappointment .
i would not recommend fat jacks .
service was 3-4 stars but food was a _num_ stars .
however the the fried mushrooms were good .
i wo n't be back .
better service , friendlier doctors , the list goes on .
most likely between _num_ and _num_ stars .
on an early saturday evening , i walked in to an empty restaurant .
my quesadilla was a bean taco , yup definitely not a quesadilla .
i ordered a burrito with chorizo and it was very bland .
it 's very greasy and runny and even the sour cream is like liquid .
food did n't look fresh and was pretty flavorless .
the refried beans look like they have an artificial light purple color to them .
service was slow and unprofessional .
spend your money in a local hardware store .
the inside is huge , but arranged poorly .
the new checkout lines are set up in a really dumb way .
it was an awkward exchange given he did n't say anything .
so bizarre !
i was probably wrong about the latter part .
he told me that 's not how it works .
again , this is apparently not how it works .
farm and fleet or fleet farm is my only go to now !
worst customer service ever !
_num_ minutes before closing .
employees avoid you instead of helping you find what you are looking for .
i then waited another _num_ minutes for my drink .
this is the 2nd time i 've been disappointed by this site .
poor management and training of staff is very evident .
horrible .
one of the worst starbucks i have ever been to .
bathrooms messy without toilet paper men 's restroom .
worst starbucks experience .
avoid this one at all costs .
big store , lots of seating and staff , filthy .
i really hate stores , especially that serve food , that are filthy .
at the moment i 'm especially pissed , because they killed my car .
the cable never connected well , as if they did n't test it .
i called to have the repair , no follow up .
( not cheaper ) .
hell no ... they eat mostly meat and some veggies .
even if it appears to be absurd , like a sunday paper .
i really do n't understand why anyone would go here .
wrong !
it 's all garbage .
the only semi good brand is sassy cow and again , guess what ?
more than six dollars per container !
the bakery section is gross , too .
your bakery department sucks big time .
you charge ridiculous prices on your desserts that are made just not right .
no worries many options to choose from near by .
they scream about being local but they really dont partner with local businesses .
i just wonder how often this happens .
and be sure to check the prices at the register !
oh yea they did disgusting !
if i had to eat that meat i would rather stare to death !
horrid meat !
not only that , but the store is over-priced and not well laid out .
the worst arby 's i have ever eaten at .
so , here is why it is bad .
_num_ ) the portions are small on every sandwich that we ordered .
_num_ ) they say they do n't have any monthly deals .
_num_ ) tried it twice and both times they messed up our order .
this place is pretty gross .
have some standards , arby 's .
horrible service .
false advertising .
however , it took _num_ minutes to get our food .
_num_ minutes we sat there and waited .
i know that french fries are not usually made in individual orders .
ridiculous .
visited for the first time on friday , july _num_ .
wow , what a disappointment .
steak sandwiches are supposed to be lean !
disgusting .
i was n't expecting philly quality , but this was gross .
bad service and unfriendly staff .
everyone looks like working there has made them bitter , fat and angry .
the food is not good ; never order the fries !
the crowd there is so-so at best , usually on the trashy side .
horrible service !
we refuse to spend our money at an establishment like this .
its no wonder the parking lot was pretty much empty !
i was excited to work with carl at my tasting .
i had some issues finding the place and traffic was bad .
i called a few days later to reschedule and left a message .
several days passed with no response .
i was left feeling he was very stuck up and unprofessional .
what a waste of time .
disappointing cakes .
fake rum , maybe ?
i really think people buy these cakes because they do n't know any better .
carl also is very stuck in his ways when it comes to design .
the kitchen room itself smelled like butter with the cake sitting in the room .
it was totally disgusting .
so carl , just a word of advice .
it 's okay , i guess .
lousy grocery and produce , but excellent doughnuts .
they have minimal selection and the prices are nothing to get excited about .
therefore , i end up there for groceries more often than not .
i have tried a few places with no luck .
so rather than waste gas money , i began calling around .
the phone was answered and i simply asked : do you carry time magazine ?
no good bye .
if she was busy she could have said that .
she says she does not know .
that is my whole experience trying to find a magazine .
i walked out feeling completely terrible .
i will not go to your store .
however , do not get your nails done here .
its decor is horrible .
it 's pricing itself out of madison .
this is not a great first impression .
this place as reopened and should have stayed closed .
literally the worst hair experience of my entire life .
the other _num_ stations were dusty .
no one or nothing was in the manicure area .
it looked like a ghost town .
the entire experience was uncomfortable .
that 's not what i 'm paying $ _num_ for .
they gave me a discount price of $ _num_ .
i did n't realize the place shut down .
the ultimate now is not the ultimate it was years ago .
it 's horrible and i strongly advise against going there .
extremely disappointing first time visit .
thank you for wasting my time today .
at $ _num_ it was definitely not a good value .
this place is for lack of a better word , simply the worst !
i ordered the fish basket , which for wisconsin should never be bad .
i was wrong .
i was very wrong !
okay , then let me do it now : the food was cold !
i would never go to this place again .
they were not exciting .
i do n't see myself ever wanting to come back for dinner .
when we got our drinks , they were weak !
that waitress needs _num_ things : some training and an order pad .
awful service , rude bartenders .
i tip well but yeah ... they might get a penny .
service sucked .
he was not at all apologetic .
this is terrible customer service .
i am looking elsewhere .
i do n't know where their beef is from .
they really deserve a _num_ so i rounded down .
the owner responded to my request with a simple `` no . ''
not a true butcher either .
this kfc never has the chicken you want ready .
the staff and customers are awful .
this place can not ever give me everything i order .
lame .
the service was slow .
when i got home , the food was poor quality .
the mashed potatoes were dry and the macaroni and cheese was lumpy .
even the coleslaw was very dry .
some of the staff barely knows english past the menu items and prices .
i really wish i had read the reviews before i came here .
a chain restaurant i thought ; how bad could it be ... ?
unfortunately , there was a big language barrier .
what bothered me was a listed dish at $ _num_ was $ _num_ !
potato wedges : awful .
zero stars .
this particular bucks seems to be hit or miss .
the crust is incredibly thin .
their sizes are not generously portioned out .
i want to like them more , but they are just sub-par .
nothing stood out to me .
i appreciated that they put the pizza in the paper bags .
unfortunately , i will not be back again .
not understanding the good reviews here .
their pizza is gross .
with so many choices , i simply ca n't consider this one again .
ate here twice .
thought it was dirty and did n't find the food very good at all .
after that though , i was n't very impressed .
curry was bland and lacked spice and punch .
ca n't really mess up the rice so no complaints .
plantains were a little soggy and lacked crisp .
food was ok , place was dingy , and the staff was very rude .
avoid i would give zero stars if i could .
uninspired chinese food from very nice people .
maybe that 's why i only had three bites .
quoted _num_ minutes , was here in _num_ .
the lo mien was also horrible .
there saving grace is their hot sour soup .
but in all honestly , nothing special .
this is not the place i recommend .
normally i think crappy chinese food is good .
still eating , but this is really disappointing so i 'm typing this now .
the general tso 's is terrible like the others say .
there 's just no flavor .
the shrimp is n't very good , but not as bad as the chicken .
the crab rangoon is terrible .
hell , asian kitchen is better than this place .
they told me that would be _num_ each .
i wo n't be ordering again .
how about you do n't nickel and dime your customers .
horrible .
i 'm not _num_ percent sure .
i 've been down south and had amazing sausage gravy .
if i want that crap , i 'll stay home and cook it myself .
i 'm not going back .
bad service and even worse `` food . ''
they get _num_ star because of all the adorable old people there .
i get it , it is small , simple , nothing special .
however , the place is not awful .
it is just your local breakfast place with food options under $ _num_ .
it was a plain ham and cheese omelette .
this restaurant reminds me of cute little hole in the wall breakfast places .
unfortunately , it just can not compete with some of its neighboring restaurants .
the diner was n't particularly busy , but it was n't empty either .
while not at all healthy , i knew it was a pretty safe bet .
not anymore .
my husband ordered a bacon cheeseburger and i had the veggie benedict .
rotten tomatoes ruin your taste for anything .
it 's pretty hard to make a bad chocolate chip pancake .
also the coffee was not good .
we were , to say the least very disappointed .
otherwise a complete waste of our money .
or previous experiences had is enjoying this establishment , but not this time .
we were disappointed , good chance we will not be returning .
poor selection , poor lighting , bad layout and overpriced .
late night madison is tough when you are hungry .
dining room is a little dingy for a chain .
hamburgers , fries , soda and of course a frosty .
likely the hamburger gave me food poisoning friday night .
my husband and son were ok , and they had nearly identical meals .
everything that is wrong with chain restaurants .
unlimited fries with every sandwich ?
really bland tasting food , and annoying atmosphere , as well as annoying staff .
the food has nothing unique about it .
quite uncomfortable , but the only seating available .
it was an experience that i will never forget .
i will be in no hurry to go back .
poor service , noisy , but pretty good food .
dude knew one thing , which was that he had not made a mistake .
upon further review , management is not getting the proper training .
it is not ok to treat a customer like that guy treated me .
could n't believe how long it took to be served below mediocre food .
we were seated promptly and our drink order was taken .
our appetizer finally arrived - but no soup .
the fries were cold on all our meals .
at that point i was disgusted - and done .
someone by the name of justin apologized , who was he ?
they could have put them back on our card 's .
extremely rude ended up leaving before we could even order .
but my low point is for the service .
we wait during _num_ minutes or more and never receive any waitress .
not our first visit , not our first choice .
extremely overpriced , underwhelming food .
$ _num_ for a meh burger ?
Neutral
if i could have given today 's experience negative stars , i would have .
nothing beyond what you can get anywhere else in this city .
this is what took red robin straight into the toilet .
from the moment we walked in , this place felt different .
she did n't even bother checking on our drink situations in the meantime .
just went all ghost and ignored us .
no big deal .
at no point does the manager come by to check on us .
not many customers at the time .
sat waiting _num_ minutes for a server to bring us menus .
there were _num_ or _num_ servers standing around chatting with each other .
was told a _num_ minute wait that turned into _num_ .
poor timing of food service .
bad experience , red robin !
anyway , the rating is for the food .
but after our most recent visit , i 'm not feeling the love .
we did n't receive any fries until they brought our order .
when she brought the bills , there was no discount .
i was very disappointed with the entire visit .
if your looking for quality customer service this is not the place to go .
food was not the greatest and the service was extremely slow .
there were no chunks of potato or clams .
the replacement was not the greatest in taste .
i really was hoping for good food not money off of our order .
wine or beer ?
no way .
service : terrible - overly helpful , yet completely unhelpful .
i 've made better wine .
in the end , they were shitty wines , and it a shitty experience .
which is too bad , because i was really looking for something nice .
horrible service , old flowers .
perhaps good product , but really poor service .
the only way its worth the money is going all day .
multiple people acted really rude .
she also stated everything was in stock .
the sales guy went down to get everything and i waited an hour .
finally he comes back and again it 's not going to work .
i could not believe it .
truly sad .
i had asked for the manager to call me and he did n't .
no respect .
he did not care .
the next day , i was sick all day .
you will be very sorry that you did !
do you like greasy overcooked american chinese ?
still terrible .
dragon & phoenix , eh pretty bad .
i went to lunch here once and then never again .
my advice , avoid this place at all costs .
your hard earned money is better spent at a different chinese take-out restaurant .
i used to eat here all the time but they 've lost my business .
the guy i talked to was completely rude they lost my business forever .
bad service average chinese food .
not worth anything .
gross .
went to noodles for lunch on a saturday , place was not busy .
bathroom was disgusting .
no paper towels .
plates and bowls ( all of them ) were chipped .
not sanitary .
for some reason it just was not hitting the spot with me .
frankly it was nowhere to be found .
very disappointing .
additionally , my japanese pan noodle bowl left much to be desired .
while i like noodles & company in general , this location is lacking .
that makes them a fast food outlet , no more .
unacceptable and disgusting .
order was taken right away and served promptly .
there were people at one other table and i believe _num_ people on staff .
also , the prices are too high .
these guys rip you off .
i went in to the urgent care as i was having severe ear pain .
i was very insulted .
i even tried a salad in an attempt to find something healthy .
i 'll keep trying , though .
boring .
it has a vanilla custard base with waffle cones and chocolate pieces in it .
first , there was not many piece of chocolate or waffle cone in it .
i like their vanilla ice cream , this flavor did nothing for it .
boring .
i should have just gotten vanilla and skipped the frustration .
the blueberries are really hard and frozen .
it was hard to enjoy because the blueberries were so hard .
i really like the donut , the pie , just everything .
it was too sweet and did not have a good cream flavor .
making cream flavored ice cream and adding chocolate does not make it boston cream .
the effort was there but the execution was sad .
i wish i had taken pictures of my visit today .
a _num_ year old electric stove ( $ _num_ ) .
an antique dresser with missing handles ( $ _num_ ) .
there goes $ _num_ .
of course the unit has an error code _num_ months later .
pretty disgusted with the service and the way i was treated .
although they may sell a good product , they are way overpriced .
shop around , they are really money hungry .
customer service was pitiful .
avoid this place .
friday fish fry was awful .
my boyfriends fish was also disappointing .
our party was seated _num_ minutes after ordering .
my bland plate of fish was n't something i 'll come back for .
i 'm just too use to food with seasoning on it .
after three attempts , we finally rode out the wait for the fish fry .
that seems to be the draw of this dumpy little joint .
the restaurant equivalent of flying coach .
it was not good .
walked in on a busy fish fry night for the first time .
the bar was two people deep so that was nearly impossible .
horrible service !
crappy food !
we put in our order for _num_ entrees and an appetizer .
it was about _num_ minutes before we were finally seated .
the hashbrowns with cheese were pretty bland and nothing to write home about .
was really excited to try their fish fry after hearing many raves .
i have too much to lose .
so i get the bartender and explain the story .
she does nothing but tell him to apologize .
so he sticks his hand out and says sorry .
come to find out the owner was the male bartender .
1st time and as i say one and done .
this place was an ass backwards train wreck .
the steak was full of gristle and had no flavor .
me no never will i stop again .
yeah , long story short ... .
the food sucked ass .
my lobster was obviously frozen burned and way way way over cooked .
the lady at the front desk tells me i 'll owe $ _num_ .
the little asian dentist comes in and once again ( surprise ! )
so i saved $ _num_ just by not going to door creek .
absolutely ridiculous .
absolutely ridiculous .
this is a harsh review but these things matter .
do not allow your dogs to go to daycare here .
not cool .
no accommodations were offered .
i would n't recommend this hotel to anyone !
this place is beyond terrible !
but stupid expensive drinks and the bartenders do not give very good service .
and only then if there is nothing else going on .
this place is awful .
no hot single chicks here .
slow service for both the drinks and our food .
waitress never checked to see if i wanted another drink .
places like this should be using mystery shoppers to test and improve their service .
it was not good .
it was not bad .
cole slaw was horrible in a little cup .
when we were half done eating she tried to clear our plates .
i really have no desire to return ever again .
the others are n't so great .
and it was indeed mediocre .
my chicken sandwich was pretty basic california chicken .
it came smothered in some sort of spread .
my sandwich felt apart immediately .
ugh .
i did n't get sick from eating it , so that 's a plus .
so the three of us all ate mediocre chicken sandwiches and we survived .
people seem to like their pizza , so maybe go with that .
no way .
the worst place to watch sports in madison !
waited over _num_ 1/2 hours to receive our apps .
gross .
looked like a party on a budget .
was n't much blue cheese in it .
my girlfriend immediately felt sick and only ate one piece .
weak tap beer line up .
marginal service levels .
the only plus , not many people showed up and good sound .
ignored it for the movie while they continued being loud and rude throughout .
they did n't even go in and check .
horrible excuse for theater staff and keeping the bs out .
when the occasion calls for it i upgrade to a purse .
but this time it created a problem .
but you see i was wrong about what they were looking for .
i was not the only one standing there .
another patron complimented me on the points i made to tom , the manager .
the box office person did not even realize that a time was cancelled .
everything else started during the _num_ o'clock hour .
it was offensive to be suggested that i see some other movie .
tonight , they lost at least ten patrons ( that i could see ) .
just check it ?
ca n't come in at all with it ?
expensive for food that is mediocre .
lame .
wrong .
it 's just bad .
horrible , horrible service .
the second time , they lost me as a customer .
the food was okay , nothing special .
if i could give them zero stars , i would .
horrible .
i went there once and had a horrible waitress .
i ordered a small deep dish pizza and it was dripping in grease .
i do n't suggest going to this place at all .
i do n't suggest coming here for a good time .
i eventually just gave up trying to call them .
the restaurant was not busy at all .
walked in and had to wait for the hostess .
the manager came to apologize , offered us a free dessert .
oh yea , then we had to wait for the check !
lost another customer .
needless to say , we took our business elsewhere .
i am disappointed to say the least .
too many other fine restaurants in madison to give this one another try .
under new ownership , the place is now called metro ford of madison .
beyond the cheesy exterior , he was nice .
here 's where i 'm not happy .
after leaving the business office my salesman takes me over to my new ride .
so i wait an hour for the truck to be cleaned properly .
i want to know how to operate the towing package .
i do n't want to take a call from god knows who !
lousy service once they have your money .
horrible place !
bad service !
i gave them _num_ full business days to fix my car .
i called my insurance company to let them know they are bad for business !
they do n't even deserve a _num_ star !
they cheated me almost _num_ thousand dollar which is very huge amount for me .
i was cheated around _num_ $ .
please be very careful if you still want to visit this showroom .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i would never do business with anyone at this firm again .
it was hit or miss and its been hot !
he was in a hurry to get out too .
it cost me 1/4 of what i paid all comfort for nothing !
i stopped in without a reservation and luckily they had a room .
not ultra modern , but contemporary design .
noisy and annoying ?
the fault of courtyard ?
not really .
however , what happened that night , i could n't sleep through .
so not entirely their fault , but still was a very bad experience .
i love dogs and feel bad for all of them that are in there .
that being said , i think that they would be better off elsewhere .
i have lived in other places and no one runs a shelter like this .
i was like this makes no sense she is a wheelchair .
dog rooms not so bad .
no bueno !
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
blech !
this place was a huge disappointment .
the place was overpriced and left me with a not so fresh feeling .
we ordered the food over the phone and it was ready in _num_ minutes .
Negative
negatives : it is not cheap .
there was not very much included with our dinner .
i was really disappointed and felt a little cheated .
but the woman who runs the restaurant with her husband blew my mind .
`` hmm ... cheap .
at this point i shrugged and took out some cash .
then she just stared at me .
i realized she wanted me to give her money for having my card declined .
but she could n't tell me , because she did n't know .
the fees are reasonable and customers generally like using it .
i 'm a big fan of sushi and was not impressed by anything here .
the seaweed salad was fine and the hot sake was average .
the rolls left for more to be desired .
i left feeling hungry and disappointed .
i was very disappointed .
what a lazy job they were doing in there .
but i wish the sandwiches were a little bigger .
i guess i 'll try the french bread next time .
miller 's is n't bad -- but it 's nothing special either .
want a room with scary stains and torn carpeting ?
the breakfast buffet was pretty weak .
the room was fine but nothing fancy .
the _num_ people at the front desk ignored us when we first came in .
i was left feeling confused .
he has never had a problem like this .
we will not be staying there again .
this easily ranks among the worst .
after getting into the room i was n't much happier .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
this not a three and a half star place .
it sucks .
toilet is cracked .
staff are not nice .
crazy loud noise at _num_ am was ignored by staff .
unfortunately , the entire city of madison moves on the same day .
so , we had no other place to stay .
if you have a choice , i would not recommend this place .
-they only spent _num_ minutes on my car and it shows .
no appt possible for detailing on weekends !
could the rumors be true that they protect certain clientele from bad reviews ?
overall it was a terrible car wash .
they seem to loose sight of what it means to detail a car .
they wiped my interior with a wet cloth , end of story .
worse place to get your car washed .
they talked more than detailing .
while the rest of the world gets a skinny sandwich and crap service .
i suggest going down the road to university station and hit the subway there .
someone please teach the employees here how to better scrub the toilets .
i almost lost my appetite after using the women 's restroom .
i was wrong .
when i want to drink at a dive i want the lights dim .
the bartender was nice but the place was empty .
it is wrong , and i was wrong for eating it .
few times in my life have i been so wrong .
the workmanship was alright but the customer service was mediocre at best .
it took many visits to ensure the job was done correctly .
i would recommend you look elsewhere for better service .
this place is awful .
we both received terrible service .
and its only _num_ dollars .
do not come here , you will be greatly disappointed .
overpriced and poor quality .
totally disrespectful and horrible job !
stopped in for relaxing mani before my trip and walk out posting this !
that said , my concerns with them were on going from the get go .
it was bad .
crusty on the outside , yet dense and soft on the inside .
i would have happily given you five stars just for your plain bagel .
they had the consistency of cardboard and no flavor .
i would never order from this location again , they are very slow .
the pizza had no feta cheese at all .
... no more domino 's for me .
i spent $ _num_ for my nails to last _num_ days !
what kind of business does n't stand behind their work .
) .
when she did , she ordered me to wash my hands .
i would return only if i could guarantee an appointment with the adult employees .
i was treated horribly !
the lady used old acrylic and it made my nails yellow !
she was rude and i will never go here again !
on two separate occasions , i stumbled upon really expired food .
gross .
since i have been only to _num_ so far this is on average ground .
there is a discount _num_ dollar bin as well .
you can also select online coupons to load to your card from the website .
incredibly depressing store .
i do n't see how they failed to miss a burned out part .
they really are n't out to impress , only to fill your belly .
i kind of wish that the menu would be more clear .
this is the worst bbq resturant i 've ever are at .
i ca n't believe i 'm writing this .
tonight was an epic fail on customer service .
when it was our turn he handed phone to the person .
it was partially wrong so i corrected and she said ok and hung up .
when the food arrived it was totally wrong .
so disappointed .
i would describe this place as mediocre at best .
i wish there was a way to give zero stars .
my first ( and only time there ) was a horrible experience .
only thing left was the meat .
sad , sad , sad experience .
coleslaw : shredded cabbage with straight vinegar on it .
i 'm pretty sure there were no other ingredient .
mac & cheese : disgusting .
black dog is minutes away but did n't want to bother .
that was a huge mistake .
crappy fast food ?
but was n't a big fan of the sides .
price was not counted correctly .
come to find out he was a manager .
i was not impressed at all !
what pork i tasted that was n't smothered in beans was n't too bad .
not a place i will re visit .
they do n't watch the expiration dates on many products , so always check .
the aisles are too small .
never been out of there under _num_ minutes after 5pm .
so if you have a choice do not come to this post office .
zero stars .
no help at all .
not that hard to deliver mail .
i would give them _num_ stars if possible .
courteous service can only go so far .
i went to take some dry cleaning here and was disappointed .
the last time i ate there was the last time .
skip it and go to sam 's cafe .
so someone my girlfriend knew said that this was the place to try .
after the drive we were starving so we needed food .
had chicken and noodles my noodles where not done at all .
the place looked clean , service i had better too .
i guess twice was enough for me .
we had the beef steak , fried chicken , and ham and beans .
even the apple dumplings were just okay .
the bedding had burn holes from cigarettes and also had the awesome cigarette smell .
do n't stay here there are better places in urbana .
i would never stay here again .
the room itself was very basic , which i expected and did not mind .
very thin walls increased the noise .
we requested new sheets for _num_ rooms because of blood and other stains .
all were very dirty with stains from floor to ceiling .
absolutely ridiculous .
only stay here if you are _num_ .
the place is dirty dirty dirty .
the carpet in the hallway is very dirty .
so i have made them a lot of money staying there .
but the blankets are nasty full of burn marks .
kenny the manager is very inconsiderate and not reasonable .
the hallway floors were nasty & so was the room .
very very very dirty , maybe a local party motel for the university nearby .
the coffee is bad .
also , the coffee only comes in small cups .
jar of rocket fuel , but settled for _num_ oz .
i think steak 'n shake is just not my style .
every other part of the meal was a disaster .
my burger was missing everything but meat and cheese .
this place is sad .
never washing his hands and never wearing gloves .
this place is a total joke !
save your hard earned money and avoid this steak 'n shake at all cost .
server was good but the kitchen sucked .
_num_ min for a chicken melt and a chilli mac .
the waitress was rude .
kept looking down at us and service was slow .
this is a horrible steak and shake !
the floor is dirty and sticky and my food was cold .
i ordered the eggplant chicken special .
i was very excited after recently having some excellent garlic eggplant from green jade .
as it turns out , i celebrated a bit too soon .
the eggplant was n't thoroughly cooked , making it sort of bitter and tough .
also , they did n't use chinese eggplant , which was sort of confusing .
it was american ( globe ) eggplant .
that dish was not spicy in the least .
they were stale and not very good .
still , i do n't think i 'll be back .
i went there again today , ordered the szechuan chicken and was very dissapointed .
never gives total over the phone .
ick .
they hire kids that do n't care much about the customers .
while others walked out with their pizzas loaded .
a poor substitute for tex-mex food .
uninspired and bland food choices .
i 'd give it a zero if i could .
this place is weak as fuck .
the location of this restaurant needs to be updated .
the beef was utterly dry and flavorless .
i did not feel welcomed here at all .
our server seemed impatient and annoyed with us .
he asked us immediately after sitting down what we wanted to order .
he looked horrified but went away anyway .
my burritos were boring and tasteless .
nothing seems to stay there for long .
this is one place that really needs to go away !
it was awful !
gross man !
lately the sides have been awful .
the okra and casserole were cold .
it was the same casserole but now was steaming hot and tasteless .
that in my opinion is really poor customer service .
it 's hit or miss and i am getting tired of it .
no big deal there .
strike _num_ .
with two steaks sent back , i 'm not exactly getting the royal treatment .
my coke was empty .
i think this breaks a record for me .
never has it ever taken this many attempts to get it right .
the steak was kinda ... meh ... not great nor bad .
there was n't a good steak flavor as i 'd expect from a restaurant .
the baked potato was delivered piping hot .
all in all , i 'm quite a bit disappointed with this visit .
probably not soon .
i 'll stick with something i normally get like fried chicken or pot roast .
do not go to this restaurant if you are a person of color .
learn from my errors , find somewhere else for your small engine repair work .
i went on-line and bought the replacement parts for _num_ bucks .
anyway skip this place for service they clearly do n't want oil change business .
not really a `` farm '' person .
i had purchased tires here a year prior to my most recent visit .
never heard back even though i followed up twice .
do not bring your vehicle to farm & fleet .
ordered one thing online and they shipped a completely different product .
avoid at all cost !
still no chairs .
supposedly they are ordered .
still nothing from the store .
no call .
no replacement furniture .
not a kid friendly location .
then , i spent another few weeks waiting for a call back .
the service is awful and you will often receive things you did n't order .
the pizza was pretty bland , despite a hefty helping of oregano .
there is very little sauce , fairly dry cheese , and a chewy crust .
the small salad was n't their best .
the service sucked .
the waitress did n't give us refills and nothing was clean .
she gave us our check but never came back to take our money .
i will not be back because of the horrible service .
i could n't believe what i was hearing .
wo n't make this mistake again .
i like other much cheaper pizza than this .
the location is literally _num_ miles from the house .
should not take this long to replace an item .
going to just go to the store for refund of the sauce and bread .
within a month they have messed up _num_ of our pizzas .
our waitress was rude and did t want to fix the issue .
avoid this place at all costs !
i would suggest picking up your order instead of delivery .
there was an additional location listed for champaign which turns out to be closer .
the pizza was barely warmer than room temperature .
i 'm really not sure how this place has gotten such high ratings .
the complementary breakfast is not good .
i 've been staying here over a month due to my job .
this has been over a month of getting breakfast .
no luck with calling for any help in complaint .
ownership does n't seem to care .
will go elsewhere next time .
their hours stink .
are you freakin ' kidding me ?
you wo n't be doing it this sunday .
so one afternoon , stopped by to eat a chicken teriyaki sandwich .
this has been the worst haircut experience of my life .
spend a little bit more money and save yourself the trouble and disappointment .
this is the worst place and the worst stuff i have ever met .
never ever go this place again .
this might have been the worst hair cut i have ever had .
inches off of my hair .
i am very very very unhappy .
there were to my knowledge _num_ employees in the salon doing nothing .
i was wrong .
clearly they do n't want my business !
very disappointed and hurt that my business was not accepted here .
overpriced and never again especially for female haircuts .
she told me no .
completely incompetent staff .
_num_ classes are where learning goes to die .
the weather here is horrible .
unfortunately they did not maintain high standards .
but some should be avoided completely .
after my first order from this place i would n't dare order again .
i ca n't believe there are so many positive reviews of this place .
never ordering from this place again .
but i was n't in the mood for meat .
bland , boring , and worst of all , super greasy .
now that 's what i call mediocre !
i 'm not a snob when it comes to chinese food at all .
cons : decor was sort of confusing and borderline gross .
the biggest con , however ?
the egg roll was disappointing .
it used to be good .
but today the barista made me so mad !
it 's like a sunday evening and there 's seriously no one here .
it 's not like i took a long time deciding what i wanted .
really , the worst of the espresso locations on campus .
the coffee here is atrocious .
cup of flavorless grey water .
third strike , you 're out !
i 've given this place three opportunities to _num_ .
ick .
sick .
starbucks became starbucks for a reason .
i do n't know what to say .
it 's just milk , dude .
the drinks , like everything else there , are overpriced for their quality .
this place is as expensive as starbucks coffee .
the only difference is at espresso royal , you get a lower quality cup .
with the starbucks right down the street it is not worth going here .
the only day worth visiting is on wednesday because they have one dollar lattes .
terrible customer service .
rob you blind at every turn .
not at all from my experience .
_num_ ) i lost my keys to my apartment .
they refused , and charged me $ _num_ dollars !
one lady started working on her while i proceeded to wait another _num_ minutes .
there 's no organization and it is just ridiculous !
after using the tools they 've just returned tools to this dirty mug .
they do not clean their own furniture and floor .
disgusting .
this is very strange for me .
i went to get my nails and toes done and left so unhappy .
not a lot of nail salons open on sunday here .
the entire salon and nail stations were disgusting .
there was a layer of acrylic dust on everything .
the place was terrible .
however , i was able to find a few suits to try on .
she did but her parents did nothing and said nothing .
i only went in to grab a shirt very quickly .
it 's a piece of junk .
the only thing you can use this worthless coupon on is their junk .
the bulbs are n't hot , and the customer service was poor .
it was not worth fighting campus traffic to get there .
we rented a truck online and had our confirmation email and receipt with us .
not helpful .
needless to say , this business ranks among the most poorly run in town .
i ordered a _num_ ' truck with no extras for my move .
this place is awful !
the employees are either dumb or just do n't give a shit .
they 're unorganized and totally clueless .
i have never used a business so poorly run .
or maybe they 're all this bad .
terrible .
also , the boxes that i bought there fell apart .
this location is weird .
their customer service is terrible .
this is unacceptable .
this place needs at least two more employees , and better customer service .
it 's fine but such a hassle for a $ _num_ rental .
it ends up costing me around _num_ minutes .
he made no effort to reach a resolution .
terribly slow .
terrible service .
other locations do much better than this one , it 's a shame really .
did n't even get to try it .
that 's not what i got .
my time was absolutely wasted .
cheap drinks .
one of your few redeeming qualities is that you have bass on tap .
hate this bar .
the only good time to go is when it 's nearly empty .
i do n't get why people go here just for the wings .
i 've had bad times at brothers .
it gets too crowded to play darts .
guard your jacket unless you want a free drink spilled on it .
it seems to be totally random .
never wasting my time at brother 's again .
my ears hurt more than anywhere else i 've been .
_num_ ) never enough space .
disgusting .
_num_ ) hot as hell .
you 'll be sweating just standing there even in the middle of winter .
the fans on the ceiling are useless .
more like a sports bar and super crowded and not really relaxing .
have no place to stand or sit .
also , the dj 's are inept .
the buzz - only reason this is getting _num_ stars .
i would avoid this company at all costs !
please avoid this company at all costs .
on top of that these people are condescending assholes .
do not use these people , they are terrible .
i was disappointed with crispy tofu that is not as good as before .
my boyfriend was a little annoyed since he had gotten something completely different .
it was very salty and unpleasant .
i felt disgusted that i actually ate half since i was so hungry .
_num_ ) a combination of number _num_ and _num_ .
never again stay away from this place !
i 've never experienced this type of service before - or lack there of .
there was n't a lot of options , only about _num_ items .
both of which were disappointing !
the shrimp crepe only had two small pieces of shrimp .
around $ _num_ to share _num_ dishes .
but now it 's barely passable .
their fried rice is all gummy and their noodle soups are too salty .
it was a very disappointing .
in my opinion , that is way too long for an hour lunch break .
we walked in and it was very hectic .
_num_ minutes had gone by and nothing .
_num_ minutes .
about _num_ minutes later , our first dish came out .
slowly , our little dim sum dishes came out .
however , my last two visits were terrible .
they simply served it .
the first time i was not sure .
i ca n't imagine why this would happen .
i ordered the hot pot and it was n't even a hot pot .
there was no soup ( wtf ) !
the food is oily and lacks flavor .
overall , i feel like i really wasted my money here .
i would give zero star if i could .
this place is a total rip off .
the owner explained that the sweet soy sauce was an extra $ _num_ .
had i not asked she would never had told me .
i said belly , and a magical one dollar was added to my bill .
then i specially asked whether the rick comes with dishes or not .
at this point , i was beyond pissed by this dishonest act .
hell i will never ever return to this restaurant .
this is a horrible place .
even after they have already known you are healthy .
she is so bad that i get anxiety talking to her .
she makes mistakes , she shows her ego , and she does not care .
they do n't know how to bill correctly !
another issue i had is for another annual exam .
better yet , just find a different healthcare facility to go to !
for the last year and a half , my experience goes like this .
get cancelled and rescheduled 3-5 times .
avoid going here at any cost !
very rude and unhelpful staff when it comes to complaints !
just save yourself lots of follow-up problems with billing and go to another place !
i did n't even have the chance to describe all of my symptoms !
the vomit smell is even there at like 8am on tuesday mornings !
it deserves zero stars .
worst .
who are you people giving these stupid reviews ?
this place is a nightmare .
there is nothing redeeming about this place .
the only time i 'm ever here is during a bar crawl .
the drinks were worse and painfully weak .
i was horrified to see people in formal wear .
the tables probably had n't been cleaned in years .
drinks are totally average , albeit cheap .
do n't they clean the floors ?
that was the only reason it did n't get one star .
just walk by the place and be overwhelmed by the smell .
i 've been in the place once and it is gross .
i ca n't imagine going to this place at a peak time .
this bar stinks !
came here _num_ years after my graduation ... and not much has changed .
it still smelled like vomit , stale beer , and service sucked .
worst bar i 've been to , period .
went there to party , fun , but the establishment itself sucks .
regretted that in _num_ hours .
what an absolute dump .
one star is too much .
what a mistake .
bookstore , but lately i am so far from a fan .
i wish i could give _num_ stars .
after having read the reviews , i was expecting more .
the woman at the counter was friendly , but the food was disappointing .
there were flies all over the place .
the produce looked so sad and wilted .
it was `` _num_ five alarm hot sauce '' level .
i could barely eat it .
ate here for the second & last time a few days ago .
unfortunately this was not the case .
the chips are straight from a bag and the salsa was quite bland .
why would you put giant pieces of green onion in with the carne asada .
these were not pleasant and bitter tasting .
very thinly sliced meat that was very chewy .
the problem is that it was thinly sliced so it was quite over cooked .
the refried beans was a soupy mess , but the mexican rice was passable .
pro : none ... .
i 'm shocked that they have _num_ stars .
let me say , i strongly regret this decision .
slowest service i 've ever had .
waitress also did not know anything about menu items .
avoid !
i was pretty stupid when i was _num_ .
needless to say it was also too crowded , dark and dirty .
they said they were delivered so they could not give me my money back .
i wasted a trip .
very disappointing considering their job is flowers and the flowers they have are terrible .
ridiculous mean !
so maybe i am not the target audience .
the problem is that the meat is not very good .
it reminds me of the frozen gyro meat you can get at grocery stores .
disappointed .
the only thing i paid for was the convenience of eating on green st .
green street did n't feel the same without you since you burned down .
although the ambiance is much improved , my gyro lacked taste .
soft , tasteless pitas with bland meat and sauce .
the greek salad was n't anything special either .
the salad does n't have enough cheese !
there are daily specials which is posted on the sign outside .
this is where it falls short .
the fries that come with the combo is a very small portion .
additionally , they are quite stingy with the meat , i.e .
overall a little disappointing .
_num_ .
not a big fan .
also no .
i felt too nostalgic here to give this place one star .
this place is horrible .
the service is very rude .
it was a really weird experience .
well ... luna still falls seriously short for me .
we ordered the shrimp special , which was grilled and came with coconut risotto .
the final disaster was the fried gnocchi .
i am a big gnocchi snob , and these were so gross .
i hated it .
sorry luna , after two attempts now , i 'm not coming back .
but , ok , they were short on menus .
the menu shortage ( ?
oily salmon leftovers .
one of our _num_ orders came out wrong .
the waitress did n't charge us for the soup .
however , their new location is n't as great as the old one .
we ordered some coconut shrimp , and some ravioli with goat cheese and asparagus .
luna used to be my favorite restaurant when it was on campus .
i mean purple and bloody , too , not just slightly pink .
and the cooks could n't even cook it through the second time ?
they did n't apologize or act like they cared at all .
the same girl came over and was like , do you have a reservation ?
we ordered a salad , melting brie pot and lobster & crab stuffed prawns .
the potato totally overpowered the brie and you could barely taste it .
so i guess that was a bad selection .
they came out ( four of them ) , not stuffed at all .
however , the service is so-so .
way too expensive for crap like that .
the food was ok , a bit overpriced but not awful .
like several other reviews here have said , they are just not the same .
she brought the table of _num_ four slices of bread .
the dishes were extremely underwhelming , and the first _num_ or _num_ were cold .
there is no way these could count as tapas .
needless to say , very disappointing , not worth the hefty price tag .
but this is not a great restaurant ; it 's a lazy restaurant .
no way .
food was overpriced and low quality .
_num_ hours for lunch is too long .
then finally after another _num_ minutes , we were being seated .
however , this nightmare did not end then .
and , we were finally allowed to order after _num_ minutes of sitting !
neither the server , nor the host , was attentive and helpful .
the server had this terrible attitude toward us the whole time .
and the foods were not the best they could be consider the price .
was it because we were furious having to wait even with a reservation ?
pros : the beignets were tasty and so was the sandwich .
i have visited luna four times now and each time is worse than before .
the service is soooo slow .
no thank you .
there was so much salt on it , i could n't eat it .
this place is so overrated it 's not even funny .
first and second , i went with a group for brunch .
my second trip , our group had reservations and we still waited _num_ minutes !
third ( and i 'm afraid final ) visit was a disaster .
our food orders were not taken at the same time ; not even close .
of course that was all wrong and took another half hour .
it 's so cold , loud and crowded .
disgusting !
_num_ courses .
without exaggeration , the food was disgusting .
the salmon tasted like it was two weeks old .
terrible .
cheap quality .
i would n't be surprised if it came from some frozen bag at costco .
i swear on my life this is the worst steak i 've ever had .
and it was like _num_ % tough , inedible fat .
i could make a better steak when i was _num_ .
the lamb chops were so tough , we could n't even eat them .
and it was still awful .
it was impossible to chew .
this was just unacceptable .
i could n't find it from the actual review page !
then finally after another _num_ minutes , we were being seated .
however , this nightmare did not end then .
and , we were finally allowed to order after _num_ minutes of sitting !
neither the server , nor the host , was attentive and helpful .
the server had this terrible attitude toward us the whole time .
and the foods were not the best they could be consider the price .
was it because we were furious having to wait even with a reservation ?
they took down my review twice ... .
it was not offensive at all except stating the facts .
the staff stare like they have never seen a woman before .
disgusting .
threw out a $ _num_ plate of food after finding hair .
wait , no , not identical .
the main courses cost about $ _num_ more than on green street .
the food was okay and plentiful , but the wait service was horrible .
however , after the last outing i will not go back .
it was a very unwelcoming place .
)
; and a totally inept management of the tables .
sub-par indian food , which passes in town .
how is that there is no good indian food in champaign-urbana ?
the food here is generic and bland .
not worth the money .
i walked out with a severe case of food poisoning .
gross .
$ _num_ for grilled chicken and a few grilled onions is not a bargain .
no rice .
around 9pm , i called again .
i tried calling , and no one picks up .
then my hunger snapped me back to my senses .
the lack of silverware and napkins was a nice touch .
i ordered chicken curry , the meat was spoiled and made me throw out .
will not come here ever again .
the food is just average indian food , nothing special .
rice was stale , cold , and hard .
incredibly poor food quality .
does n't seem like they put any effort into their food or service .
i 've ordered takeout before during lunch hours and was always charge lunch price .
very disappointed by this experience .
i had the dinner at this place few months back and it was disappointing .
i had veg assorted appetizer , chicken tikka masala and naan .
veg appetizer was ok , rest was not good .
they were so oily and soggy .
i was hoping samosa will save the day but hell no : ( .
the filling was bland , the pastry was neither crispy nor flaky .
the only thing tasting good was tea , which was made by me .
that 's it , no more trying indian restaurants in champaign .
no one should pay $ _num_ for _num_ pages of paper .
i did n't like this place .
first , the service is slow .
gyros are below the average and chicken is too greasy !
so , this place is so overrated !
thumbs down !
unfortunately !
what i did n't expect was for my order to take _num_ .
but who can turn down amazing chicken strips ?
under those conditions , i say go for it .
the only thing that kept us coming back was their awesome chicken strips .
you 're not allowed to browse and he will frequently tell you so .
i was in this shop once when i was picking up my girlfriend .
i was just killing time and saw this shop .
i have n't been treated that bad in a store since i was _num_ .
your little model cars on the wall were filthy .
for fast food sandwiches , i vote subway .
then she hung up on me without as much as a goodbye .
not very fast .
been _num_ minutes .
disappointed .
rude .
the dogs there are all sad .
can we say gross ?
it 's not as if i had high expectations ... .
literally , i went orange eating it .
just bad .
hardly sanitary ) .
every time ( no joke ) they have messed up my order .
i would not recommend this restaurant .
any food would suffer from sitting for an hour .
this is the worst chinese food i have ever had in my entire life .
a total waste of money .
ate here a while ago and did n't really like the food .
read the bad reviews .
knew it was not going to be that great .
got this chinese fish dish that was just absolutely horrible .
fish fillet floating in grease with absolutely no taste .
avoid at all cost .
why go here when there are much better restaurants around .
i really love chinese food but this place was absolutely horrible .
but why the hell would i do that ?
in addition , it 's only steamed rice and not fried rice .
however , the food is practically tasteless .
this , i have to say is a major disappointed .
avoid at all cost .
i was trying to find a place to have dinner tonight .
the spring rolls were okay , i suppose , though really not that great .
the problem was really with the basil chicken : it was honestly quite gross .
first , why do they use ground chicken ?
that 's just wrong .
ground chicken is wrong .
and the dish was just not good .
i ate a little bit of it and was done .
for the next half hour i had a gross taste in my mouth .
lesson learned : even thai food is n't always a safe choice .
the latter ( basil thai ) is by far the worst .
ugh .
a curry dish with barely any veggies ?
no , potatoes do not count .
curry is hard to mess up because it has such strong flavor .
however , given a choice , why go and have bad food ?
however , there are better sit-down thai restaurants in town .
nothing but bad service here .
the car was not ready when i arrived .
he would n't help me out in anyway and was just a terrible employee .
bad customer service .
i do not recommend it !
by far the worst service i have ever had in my life .
i did n't even know that was possible .
oh god , where do i start ?
be warned , this company will absolutely nickel and dime you .
staff is rude , inconsiderate .
staff is not friendly .
i have lived in la , chicago , nyc for many years .
but that 's not the worst part .
why not appeal to god directly ?
i will not be returning to this location for anything .
why would i get a service that is n't recommended ?
their approach to customer service is bizarre .
they stopped the upsell after that .
then , i started having performance problems with my tires .
i know they can wear early , but that is really early .
that explains my poor performance !
but , jiffy lube lost me as a customer .
worse place in town !
when i complained the guy shrugged his shoulders and said sorry .
very very rude staff !
the food however , was underwhelming .
spicy tuna was terrible .
the taste was lacking and the rice seemed a bit stale .
do n't waste your time .
the price may be decent , but the food lacks the same feeling .
first of all this is not one of my favorite types of foods .
the portions are really small which really did n't bother me .
it was about a _num_ inch by _num_ inch square .
what really cracked me up was the vegetables .
( and i am not exaggerating , that was what she told us . )
the food was horrible .
and the service was the worst thing at this place .
ugh .
this is the kind of place that gives sushi a bad reputation .
menu presents typical appetizers individual cuts rolls bento boxes and dinners , again typical .
worst japanese food in town !
we were refused service and told they were getting ready to close .
i can not image turning away business in a poor economy .
it was strange and somewhat offensive .
the problem with this place is the service .
no kidding ?
not , apparently .
we actually had to leave , i had an appointment .
overpriced , mediocre sushi restaurant that only knows how to sell atmosphere and presentation .
this place does neither .
but they put onions on every aspect of my bento box .
my below average bento box cost a total of $ _num_ too .
the price is n't worth it for the quality or quantity .
on a saturday evening , we waited _num_ minutes without anyone taking our orders .
waited another _num_ minutes , still no one to take our order .
so we walked out .
not enough waiters , the chef has to come out to serve by himself .
bad management , ca n't hold a dinner service on a saturday night .
everyone in the restaurant was waiting for his or her food .
my friend and i went there and order ramen .
the service is very slow .
the ramen is so bad .
this place is a joke !
first time my wife and i came here the service was awful !
same awful service .
we could all smell trash while sitting there .
so sad !
horrible service !
tried to take my wife for a birthday dinner .
most of the frames were name brand super expensive .
so i go back to get it adjusted .
after i left , i noticed that there were scratch marks on the metal !
maybe because they did n't want to do business with me .
i spent m it was such bad luck that i went to the location .
i wish i never had known about the place .
it did n't have a lot of flavor .
i have been there twice and both times i have not been that impressed .
but the fried chicken was not that good .
it was really dry .
the fish is n't anything special either .
when i walked in it was not a welcoming atmosphere .
they acted like i was bothering them and i felt rushed to order .
maybe it 's because i am not a regular .
it was neither .
mac and cheese is awesome but small portions .
i love the okra and the collard greens .
however their customer service is the worst .
the food was just sitting on the counter .
i will not come back to this place ever again .
went here , was n't aware of what time they close .
so we went in and wasted _num_ min .
Negative
if i could give _num_ stars i would , or maybe even negative stars .
the wait is insane .
just rude .
would not recommend this restaurant !
the champaign olive garden has declined significantly within the last year .
fridays and your applebee 's .
well , it 's not like that anymore .
it was disgusting .
i guess the thing is that it did n't used to be this way .
but now it 's not .
the house salad is awful and so are all the soups .
she apologized and said no one had told her that we were there .
i ordered bruschetta and salad and my companions had soup and salad .
but the bruschetta was just awful .
she never refilled any of our drinks and just seemed sort of distracted .
no apology , nothing .
not complicated to pour some sauce on the noodles !
over _num_ hours for an average meal .
it 's always slow when we go , but that was just insane .
the service was the worst i have had in some time .
one bite in we realized the cheese had separated and it was barely warm .
very poor quality food .
the only bright side of this dinner was the pleasant waitress .
our pizza was mushy and undercooked .
i could n't eat it .
the description was nothing like the actual entree .
extremely poor service !
alas not so good .
somehow my two bowls of soup came out lukewarm which was quite disappointing .
unfortunately , not a good cut of beef as they were tough and chewy .
typical olive garden , standard menu , nothing special .
party of _num_ .
our cups sat empty for most of our meal .
we did n't have enough time for our app .
i have zero complaints about our food , just the service was awful .
good food but lacks a family friendly environment .
i did not like the sausage .
let me begin by saying that our waiter was very friendly !
i am usually extremely satisfied with champaign restaurants but this visit was pitiful .
i asked for my salad with no olives , it had olives .
i asked for meat sauce with my ravioli , i got red sauce .
i asked for a refill on my drink , never got one .
she came to our table maybe _num_ times total .
i am not sure why this restaurant gets so busy .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the garlic and wine sauce was really heavy and not appetizing .
_num_ .
_num_ .
salad dressing very sour .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
: ( i am thinking they do n't have good turnover .
the golden moon tea does n't taste like anything i bought from golden moon .
but if you love quality and freshness , avoid !
the teas i bought from the jar taste stale and bad .
overall , there are plenty of better places for chocolates .
the menu is basically two choices : steak or chicken .
was sadly disappointed .
sadly no other steak cut options .
i really do n't get some of the reviews of this place .
ok , you people need to get out of central illinois more ... .
just about the only thing you can order here is a ribeye .
but you ca n't get any other cut of meat .
the salad bar is terrible .
unless you want a _num_ ounce ribeye .
let me first describe the restaurant 's ambience .
when i was there the restaurant was very busy and extremely noisy .
the ribeye steak is low quality meat .
eating the steak is not a pleasant or satisfying experience .
coleslaw would be on par with that available in a chain supermarket deli .
overall , the salad bar is not worth ordering .
it just is not very good .
bread is a hot , fresh loaf , but mediocre nonetheless .
that is , prices are neither too high nor are they particularly good values .
service is adequate but unremarkable either way .
for me , this all is about _num_ 1/2 stars on yelp .
disappointed .
worst .
why oh why ca n't we rate zero stars ?
Neutral
knowing how bad the steak is , i ordered the shrimp .
_num_ times worse than the steak .
hell , even the courier cafe in urbana has a better salad bar !
disgusting .
not much flavor , and not a high quality meat .
and if that does n't work ask `` what restaurant is your favorite ? ''
first time out of maybe a hundred i did n't get a good recommendation .
the salad bar was the only redeeming quality .
_num_ bucks before the tip .
this is not that kind of place , although it thinks it is .
the menu offers three options : ribeye , chicken , or shrimp .
i do n't mean to trash this place too much though .
the ribeye said it was no problem .
you can get a mediocre steak for a lot less .
the steaks are ok , but thin for the price and always overcooked .
the shrimp is ok , too .
i am only halfway joking .
even with the full house we did not have a long wait .
i ordered a _num_ oz .
ribeye rare with sauted mushrooms and loaded baked potato .
so ordered the _num_ oz .
they were not bad , but they were not sauted .
steak was below average and service was lacking .
i try to avoid them as much as possible .
they could n't even offer anything else !
... ... ... .
once again , a terrible experience .
unfortunately we had a gift certificate .
i will happily spend that money elsewhere .
never even came out of his hole in the back .
i do not recommend renting from u group at all .
they were extremely rude when my roommate and i called them .
maintenance is terrible !
the leasing manager is terribly rude and the staff is clueless !
avoid !
avoid !
when i opened the door the stench was overpowering .
it smelled like the last tenant was someone with _num_ cats .
and that was nothing compared to the fact it was so so dirty .
i spent saturday night in a smelly apartment with no power .
horrible apartments and management .
first they gave trashy apartment without cleaning .
second they do not agree that it is dirty .
never rent their apartment !
they do not care tenants at all .
it 's suffering living in their apartment year round .
the worst .
just a bad experience all around .
we tried really hard to keep it away .
can you imagine how terrified i was at that moment ?
there are _num_ men in my living room and i was in bed .
this is rude !
i can not think of a reason for the wall to be painted again .
lastly , my friend come to visit me in summer .
and the parking lot is almost empty during the summer .
so my friend parked at an empty lot .
then the car get towed .
why do n't you leave a note for a visitor 's car ?
you 're new , confused , slightly nervous about everything .
in the middle of the shelf , plain for all to see ?
not ok.
not ok at all .
and i thought , `` what the hell am i gon na do now ?
and i officially hate carrie 's now .
also , carrie is not always the most friendly shop owner .
did ya look down the hallway , asshole ?
so that 's not why it gets _num_ stars .
maybe it was the overall lack of options .
the people were n't friendly or helpful .
but there are problems with other members there .
how insulting .
i shop the bulk bins because there is variety .
should n't be a surprise , really .
no thank you .
i think most things here our overpriced and sub-par quality .
do n't go here if you can avoid it .
the next day my radiator tank was completely empty .
Neutral
unreal negative experience .
items are overcharged and there is no return policy .
very dirty store with dust all over the shelves and items .
indifferent and unhelpful personnel does not know the inventory of the store .
this company is a complete fraud .
do n't give these people money .
i would give it zero stars if thats an option !
we were stranded at the bus stop for _num_ hours in the cold wind !
no apology .
no explanation .
no specific schedule for the next bus !
for dry cleaning they are extremely expensive .
they have lost our business for good .
well , no more .
on top of it all -- they are extremely expensive .
i used the fluff and fold service _num_ times .
the first time , i was missing some pants .
so that forced me to go there again .
do n't support this business please .
my husband brought in a suit and a $ _num_ coupon .
the fee for the suit was $ _num_ .
his charge should be $ _num_ , right ?
well , they charged him once for $ _num_ and again for $ _num_ !
however , now that it has happened twice , i do not trust them .
i drove down there with receipts .
it 's a shame it was the one closest to my apartment .
when i went to pick up my dry cleaning , the cover was gone .
needless to say , i wo n't be returning .
we used the laundromat and it is wicked nasty .
if i could give these movers a zero , i would .
so we used these folks -- it was a disaster from the beginning .
i 'll echo what another reviewer said : _num_ star is _num_ too many .
after two hours the movers never showed .
thirty minutes later no one shows and i call and cancel .
save yourself the worry and avoid like the plague .
she promised a quote the next day , which i never received .
your stuff will be _num_ weeks late , with broken and missing items .
if i could rate this company zero stars , i would .
very unhappy and unsatisfied customer .
the food was just okay , nothing to rave about .
as far as specialties go , i 'd say , the diner stack ?
i gave them another shot a few weeks later , this time for lunch .
not a fan .
however , no .
diner with overly hovering waitresses and bad orange juice .
but ick .
crispy yet soft , i could 've had platters of this thing .
maybe that 's snooty , but i just hate it .
they looked me in the eye but never acknowledged my presence .
unfortunately , champaign has a lack of diners and _num_ hour restaurants .
( and the quality delivered is mostly poor . )
too bad .
service _num_ stars , food _num_ stars , atmosphere _num_ stars .
so terrible .
i would have to say that the wait staff is top notch .
the sausage and eggs were good without complaint .
overall with the oil and salt , it was somewhat difficult to eat .
ordered a mega omelet with no ham , it comes back with ham .
the customer service was just that bad .
when i pointed it out to the waitress , she just shrugged .
so disappointed in the whole experience .
however , we were not asked if we wanted more .
wrong , not if they do n't ask you if you want more .
he also took my salad before i was done with .
he did n't bother to ask me if i was done with it .
they were so slow .
they were really salty and just ... well , not good .
we also split a burger , which was decent , but very very heavy .
i think i maybe had _num_ bites of it .
i refuse to go to tgi friday 's in champaign anymore .
however , truly bad service is inexcusable .
this is n't what bothers me .
at another restaurant i 'd be totally willing to forgive and forget .
i liked the fried green bean appetizer with wasabi ranch sauce quite a bit .
i wo n't be back .
disappointed .
normally things here are ok - nothing fantastic .
i got exactly _num_ tiny chunks of avocado and zero cilantro .
in addition , it was a hot mess .
the arrival of our food was the second disappointment of the night .
talk about bad presentation !
needless to say , he finished it but still went home hungry .
this is all on top of the ridiculous prices they charge .
almost $ _num_ for _num_ mozzarella sticks ?
$ _num_ for a small steak ?
bad values all around .
horrible , horrible , horrible .
the service was bad and the food was worse .
i love chain food but this place is awful .
i doubt i will ever go back to a tgi fridays at any location .
i ordered some sort of pasta alfredo with chicken .
the pasta was so overcooked it was mushy .
the chicken was so overcooked i could barely cut into it .
save yourself the time and money and avoid this place .
it was pretty trashy for the otherwise very nice atmosphere .
no thanks .
this place is an absolute joke .
it 's extremely overpriced ( $ _num_ for a solo ham and cheese crepe ?
and i asked for cheddar on top - what the hell ?
$ _num_ for shitty american shredded cheese ?
no thanks .
this is not the case here .
she then disappeared for the entire meal and came back only for the check .
thanks but no thanks .
i ordered a $ _num_ ham and cheese crepe .
once they took his empty soup bowl away , the wait began .
we probably did not get our food for another 20-30 minutes .
and again , there were _num_ other parties of _num_ in the restaurant .
no one even looked at us .
i do n't know why they could n't have used white flour .
the food is good but the customer service is awful .
not worth the hassle .
i took my children here while visiting my sister in champaign .
wrong .
it was nothing like it .
we could barely fill up _num_ minutes here .
the water interactive display had no water in it .
the sand exhibit was missing some sand .
i was wrong .
there were about _num_ people crammed into the main room , paying .
charlie and the chocolate factory was playing , but there was no volume .
i am not kidding .
these people are clueless .
we complained and were reluctantly given our money back .
what a sad , sad place .
to begin with , the place was dirty .
it looked like no one cared about it .
do n't be fooled .
avoid this place !
one word nasty !
i would n't recommend it .
dirty - everything is dirty and dusty .
plus - $ _num_ to get in ?
this was awful .
when the food showed up it was just as bland as the chips .
just unacceptable .
the food though , has much to be desired .
last night we went there and i got chicken tacos .
they were so horrible that i only took one bite .
they were that bad .
the chicken tasted like it was canned .
as the saying goes : i 've got _num_ problems .
getting the order wrong and forgetting a side ?
bad news .
worse news .
Neutral
unfortunately i should have followed the negative reviews .
the rice was drenched in grease .
it even smelled bad as the waiter put it in front of me .
omg out out a bag , just horrible .
too mad for them because , as i said , i love mexican food !
everything was drowned in a red sauce that tasted canned .
however , our server was a really nice guy .
not very authentic , and my rice was severely undercooked .
they used yellow cheese on my tacos .
much better choices for mexican food in champaign .
unless you buy your tickets several weeks in advance .
did i mention i 'm having a slow day at work ?
it should n't be a big deal to go to chicago .
it should n't use up all my money or my patience .
chicago is a major travel hub and the closest major city .
the fact that it is so difficult to get to hurts the university .
the delays have ranged from _num_ hour to _num_ hours .
totally bland .
the american fries were a soggy mess and also without flavor .
did these reviewers eat the same stuff as i did ?
it was soggy and relatively flavorless .
do n't know what i ordered here but it was dirt cheap .
probably less than $ _num_ .
you get what you pay for but the food is cheap quick and easy .
there 's an _num_ % chance that sam could be serving you .
i 'm definitely never going back .
no clue how this has _num_ stars .
french toast was hidden like a pancake .
we were completely disappointed and frustrated afterwards .
so we sat down and the service was just terrible .
he talked way too fast and barely gave us time to respond .
did n't like him at all .
* another problem we had here .
there seems to be only one cook .
they talk about that customer as if she was in the wrong .
another problem are the extremely small tables .
cheap .
but that is where it begins and ends .
but other than those two things , i see no positives about this place .
stood in there for twenty minutes before anyone noticed us .
four tables without people , all covered with plates and trash .
we were told it would be awhile because there were no tables .
incredibly rude , clearly do n't care for customers or loyalty .
will not be returning .
the food was just s bit too greasy and eggs were over cooked .
they serve the typical junk food and it is very crowded during the weekends .
they have a few specials too , so do check those out .
i was in champaign last week , on a wednesday evening .
murphy 's was the only place with their kitchen open after 10pm .
i ordered a mega bacon cheeseburger and fries .
service here was terrible .
all in all , a terrible meal .
either way , that was a bit annoying , so strike two .
really murphy 's ?
what i was served was a ridiculously gross , flavorless hockey puck .
so , thanks , but no thanks murphy 's .
folks , i highly advise you to pass this place up .
do you get the idea it was bad ?
skip it and save yourself a possible trip to the dentist .
_num_ stars for tradition , _num_ stars for food quality and _num_ for service .
the female bartender that took our lunch order had zero personality .
i 'm glad it was n't a problem .
i 'd recommend drinking here at night , but not eating .
what a shit hole !
it was almost _num_ in the afternoon and i sat at a pub table .
it smells like dick cheese in here mixed with vomit and under dried towels .
i do not understand how this bar continues to exist .
but _num_ just leaves me speechless .
my point is , they have _num_ drink craftsmanship .
food : food service is poor though the food is fairly good .
if i were working all night i 'd get hungry too .
eh , this place was alright .
next off , i had the burger .
the fries were mediocre at best .
the onions were overwhelming and there were too many potatoes and not enough mushrooms .
i also asked for my eggs to not be runny and they were .
in a skillet that can be gross .
i only gave them two stars because that is what i truly feel .
as i said , food was mediocre .
wo n't try it again .
it just seems every time i go , something is n't right .
so on saturday i ordered the la petit french toast .
these reminded me of pancakes at ihop : bland tasting black holes for syrup .
originally i would have given this place _num_ or _num_ stars .
the server seemed annoyed and did n't assist me with any other options .
i ended up with _num_ eggs and a bowl of plain oatmeal .
slow service would n't even refill my drink .
interior is dingy and the tables were sticky i would not recommend this place .
it was n't horrible but it was definitely forgettable .
greasy old restaurant carpeting dirty .
$ _num_ for spaghetti ?
then the restaurant filled up and the service was non-existent .
but frankly , next time , i 'll go to the olive garden .
all in all i do n't know what we will ever go back .
i am in hopes the owners eventually make me want to return .
that just is n't possible ! ''
um , why would that be , exactly ?
they were t exactly busy but , ok , whatever .
so then the bill comes .
then , i looked at the bill .
sadly , none of that is true now .
it 's closed !
it was disgusting .
needless to say , we warned the next people who attempted to sit there .
still no sign of my food .
by now it 's been ten minutes .
i flag down the next passing employee , who happens to be the manager .
i tell him to cancel my order and give me a refund .
the drive through wait was longer than i had expected but not the worst .
she said she was just checking to be sure they were there .
i prefer a crisp cold salad like most people .
however , the ring of onion on it is very hot .
overall the booth 's were simply sticky .
_num_ .
_num_ .
worst customer service ever !
the worst i never had a problem with this in the past .
if they had run out would n't just put a sign up ?
nope just to lazy to change it .
as well no napkins in dining room at all !
and i always get sad because it is so gross in there .
i got there late and there was no seating .
i would give this place zero stars if i could .
this place is totally overpriced , and they 're sloppy .
also , the massage chairs suck .
okay , so i went back to give this place a second chance .
total mistake .
needless to say , i definitely wo n't be coming here again .
they are rude and do a horrible job .
i 'm do n't giving this place a chance .
gross !
he cut my cuticles so low they started bleeding .
if i could give this less stars i would .
this place is completely shady and horrible .
would never recommend to anyone else .
zero stars !
worst pedicure of my life .
terrible service .
terrible pedicures .
somehow i find that their food is kinda bland .
so first things first , they do n't accept cash .
so i order one of the specials , which is tofu soup and fish .
so yeah , the food is okay , not too bad .
the owner was irritated as promised in other yelp reviews .
the boss trying to sell me something they want to sell , which sucks .
and the food is very low quality in all the korean restaurant .
never has a restaurant left more of an impression on me .
i have never felt worse after a meal or left more dissatisfied .
you could not pay me $ _num_ to eat the food i ordered again .
neither of us had eaten all day .
that 's _num_ cents an ounce .
the entire plate of nachos probably cost them $ _num_ .
apparently `` smothered '' burritos actually means fucking coated with nacho cheese .
you can tell i really hate this shit .
the beef in my tacos was ground fine .
not joking .
the beans were the texture of a watery soup .
the chicken taco was edible .
i was starving though .
i did n't touch the nacho cheese coated burritos .
you could tell the servers did not like working there .
our server did n't bring us the check .
also , the service was mediocre .
she was n't even bad , she just lacked a personality .
yuck , this place has really gone down hill .
the chips had no salt and the salsa tasted like ketchup .
it looked like baby food and did not hold together at all .
our server was attentive , i ca n't fault him .
we saw that on fridays they have a $ _num_ frozen strawberry margarita special .
they were n't even worth eating .
business is closed as of the end of november _num_ .
the bar portion also pretty bad .
it 's always hard to get the attention of the bartenders .
beer is n't great and it 's relatively expensive for what it is .
they also have a terrible patio in the back .
on top of that the food is n't really very good .
so it fails at being a bar and sports bar .
big mistake !
they came back from the bar after another 20+ minutes without drinks .
not to mention the utter lack of life on a friday night .
i want to punch that guy so bad .
i am so glad me and my friends do n't go here often .
the fries were cold and the service was less than desirable .
i do n't recommend anyone go to the champaign hooters .
food really , really bad .
i gave it _num_ [ $ ] just because it so overpriced .
this however was the worst food i have ever had at any location .
the chicken was so dry and cheese sauce was hard and tasted disgusting .
i just wanted a beer and the service was horrible .
maybe because it was monday night and the c team was working .
worst hooters ever !
walked out after sitting for _num_ minutes - no service .
waitress standing around .
empty tables all around .
not worth it .
we will not return to this place and never recommend to our friends .
maybe i 'll give it another try .
i 've never had such a horrible and disgusting excuse for fried rice .
there was nothing in it .
effing gross .
the chicken did not taste like general tso .
it was not spicy .
it was not flavorful .
dry , tough , stringy , chewy .
peking garden was a weird case for me though .
at the time , i would have almost gave it a _num_ star rating .
i was glad i did n't though .
the service was also bad this trip .
it was not fun especially since we both had to work later that day .
she informed me that it was carrots , onions , chicken and sauce .
it did n't even contain carrots or onions .
she replied , `` i do n't care ! ''
i wish i could rate _num_ stars .
rude !
the man yelled back and then hit him again .
no one should go to this restaurant .
something about the ambiance of the place puts me off though .
needless to say i was none too happy and gave up .
the sausage is still good , but everything else tasted like crap .
my daughter had the pancakes with link sausage .
the vegetable soup was ok but it had a lot of corn in it .
ordered a full order of biscuits & gravy , the meal came fairly quickly .
it was hot as well .
everything else ranges from okay to awful .
this place is the worst .
however , that does n't make up for the rude service .
terrible staff .
they are rude to their customers and act way more important than they are .
i explained to them that due to a condition i could not sit differently .
_num_ cats are ok in most places , no dogs .
washers and dryers in the complex sometimes work , usually do not .
also , outside and inside lights are quite frequently not working .
every single item on the list was checked to be cleaned .
that is outrageous and appalling .
this lasted at least _num_ months .
do not go there !
i am very disappointed in the pedicure i received today .
the whole experience was rushed , which made me feel very uncomfortable .
this lady ( the owner ) had an overall rough touch .
worst bar i 've ever been too .
pay $ _num_ dollars for cover and expect a complete waste of your money .
not even a hello or good morning !
this mall has really gone downhill in the past few years .
it seems as though no stores can survive there .
the food court is really nothing special .
i left the place and will not recommend it .
they do n't know their head from their ass .
the guy said they did n't sell anything like that .
_num_ people behind counter but i couldnt get waited on .
rude rude rude .
will never walk in store again .
the warranty will be valid , just need to contact customer service .
this required me to take a day off from work to receive the bed .
i feel like i am not a very valued customer .
i was not satisfied with my stay .
it had a cheap feel to it .
there was a time _num_ years ago when la quinta was a quality brand .
not anymore .
what really irritated me was the pricing .
a king bed is $ _num_ more than two beds .
better than most chain pizza , it 's ok .
its awful cardboard with some sauce and cheese on top .
i did not like the pizza .
the waitress seemed to be a little rude .
slow service and bad food .
the pizza is just ok .
the appetizers are frozen and low quality .
service is always slow and they constantly forget basic things like straws .
cheap and perfectly adequate .
the kind of place you order from because it 's close and cheap .
they have some , but very limited in type and variety .
anyway , plenty of other bars that would be happy to have my money .
no , i do not need your assistance .
no , i do not want to discuss my weekend plans with you .
no , i do n't care anything about you or your life .
but the more i went , the less they seemed to want me there .
i 've learned cutting curly hair dry is almost always a disaster .
avoid at all costs !
also , the salon was a sauna !
overall , it was a really horrible experience .
awful , amateur job .
_num_ of the last _num_ times i 've been the order has been wrong .
i did n't realize either time until i got to work .
i 'm guessing they ca n't leave after work stars and neither can i .
went there numerous times and my orders have been messed up .
i hate this mcdonalds .
i 'm not exaggerating .
i 'm dead serious .
the worst quality mcdonald i have been to .
the other side is missing .
terrible service and management .
this is a terrible place for anybody looking to enjoy themselves .
if having fun is not your thing , check out fat city .
the second time i went was a tuesday night .
the worst i 've experienced in champaign-urbana .
drinks took literally _num_ minutes .
the food sucks .
)
never heard or experienced any thing like that before .
worse cleaning i have ever had .
i showed up _num_ minutes before my 2:00 o'clock appointment as requested .
not `` chinese food '' .
just same things fried in same sauce .
i did not get them at panda express at the mall .
it was filthy and smelled so rotten i wanted to vomit .
they have seafood .
should n't that shit be in a cooler or something ?
what probably should have cost her $ _num_ cost her $ _num_ .
they only accept cash , probably because they make up prices as they go .
really do n't recommend to shop in this store .
lots of foods are expired and still on the shelf for sale .
that 's not the reason why i 'm giving far east _num_ stars .
i 'm not sure what is going on with that .
i would avoid the meat .
and i would avoid the produce .
too old .
too old .
check those expiration dates though .
you will often buy expired food and food without expiration date .
can not imagine the poor quality of some food .
they just put expired food at the most obvious place on the shelf .
not a happy girl here .
would not do again .
no biggie .
unbelievable .
her excuse was that my frames were to `` beat up '' .
i scheduled an appointment , then received a call the day before the appointment .
`` we ca n't take new contact appointments after 4pm . ''
`` we ca n't accept new contact appointments after 2pm . ''
this time i did not reschedule .
when i asked to speak with manager , she was not taking calls .
i ca n't stand this place ... .
forget it , that 's in another part of the store .
damn you toys r us !
we wasted all the time we had on that and got nothing else done .
dude , this pizza is gross .
i ca n't imagine why anyone would order from here .
too bad they would n't let me though .
something 's very wrong .
pizza is not anything to write home about , that is for sure .
why wo n't yelp let me give zero stars ?
the animal emergency clinic of champaign is a scam .
very minor stuff .
the original surgery itself was n't much more than that !
)
, but gave us back a dog that was covered in blood .
i brought my dog in who was very sick and not doing well .
humans do n't even get charged this much for simple iv therapy !
i do n't get it .
it 's not worth the visit .
now , super _num_ is ... a super _num_ .
i 'm so sorry , pops .
there is even a nicer super _num_ near lincoln avenue .
honestly , do n't stay here unless every other hotel is booked .
we waited too long to book and this was all we could find .
the sheets in the bed looked clean but they were very worn .
i just did n't want to touch anything in there .
we booked the room through priceline , only paid $ _num_ for room .
i do n't need fancy , i just need comfy .
it was so gross !
old , smelly , & creepy .
( of course my hubby would point out they had old tvs too . )
my hubby called to say he could n't stay there .
he went next door to la quinta for $ _num_ .
because i booked through priceline i was not allowed a refund .
this should tell you it is not ok to stay there !
room size and cleanliness were acceptable and so was was the continental breakfast .
the room smell made the stay uncomfortable .
in fact , it was awful .
i reluctantly accepted the response and scheduled my appointment .
they talked on the phone the next day and he was extremely rude .
they do n't care about anything except for your money .
and the second visit totally ruined my hair .
for sure will never ever go there again .
first , it 's very pricy .
it 's not worth the price .
after a few months , i gave a second try .
i went here to find out about wedding dress alterations .
i would not recommend .
she did n't know the warranty plans when i asked her .
even sold the wrong size ring to us after we tried it on .
i go here a lot because i live nearby .
also i wish the dim lighting and the weak espresso could be improved .
i guess i 'd try this place once more , just to be fair .
not really a fan .
$ _num_ for a pint of pasta salad ?
$ _num_ for a cup of yogurt with _num_ blueberries and some granola ?
i really would want to avoid this place because of the service .
every time i 've been here , they always get something wrong .
i just feel that the are n't very attentive .
ugh .
i dunno , new hire ?
for the listed reasons , the latte was given zero stars .
avoid until they get over themselves .
man was i disappointed by my experience here .
the woman said `` no i do n't need to run it again .
sadly .
however , it rang up as _num_ .
why should i bother shopping here ?
almost everything was well over $ _num_ per meal , even the staple stuff .
second problem : no leftovers .
first off , our waiter only understood about _num_ % of what we said .
he did n't understand and sent the manager over .
i cook thai food at home .
this was the must disgusting restaurant i have eaten at in years .
i was obviously disgusted and i told the waiter .
he ran away because he did n't want to deal with it .
i tried to get his attention but he was ignoring us !
also , the few bites of pad thai that i did have were awful .
not flavorful at all .
i will never be back .
very disappointed .
potato in the curry tasted like it was canned .
no authentic thai flavors .
bland and tasteless .
but eating there is just kind of depressing sometimes .
i wo n't be back .
this was the worst thai food i 've ever had !
they used canned mango for my mango and sticky rice dessert .
the chicken stays were microwaved .
this experience was very disappointing .
the older woman who started to serve me was not very nice at all .
warning check your credit cards and bill !
refused to refund fraud charges !
update : after _num_ months the credit card issue was resolved .
what 's worse ?
dont eat here unless you want a two month ordeal for fraud charges .
avoid this dirty horrible establishment at all costs !
the conversation with the owner was unbelievable , laughable at best .
she demanded to know what else we ate .
lived in _num_ e white st , champaign for half a year .
anyway , never resident in _num_ e white !
however , i am a very clean tenant and did all my cleaning .
if you are thinking of renting here ... do n't do it !
the apartments are not in good shape considering that they are fairly new .
it is sad how continually they are allowed to take advantage of their tenants .
the construction is getting ridiculous at this point .
this is not right .
it 's not fair .
i want my rent back .
this is ridiculous .
that 's just not right .
today is april _num_ , _num_ .
the apartment is a mess .
they do n't care about their tenants .
they , i quote , are `` dogs '' .
everything was ok after move in although the furnishings were dated and quite worn .
this unit is by far the worse unit you can possibly get yourself into .
the apartment itself was disgusting ' !
i fell sick the first week .
ca n't wait to move out of this company .
by far the worst place i ever loved at in my life .
they do not care at all about you .
i really do n't get what the big deal is with this place .
this place is over rated .
given all this , the $ _num_ entrees on the specials menu were surprising .
not so .
to top it off , service was poor .
you have been warned .
so , went here on a busy saturday night .
for burgers that cost around $ _num_ , i would expect a lot more .
it 's nothing special , neither good nor bad .
i tried it twice , it underwhelmed on both occasions .
the service was n't good .
poor beer , wine and food selection ( as in no selection ) .
tortilla chips come standard and it 's extra for fries ?
no pink in sight .
she may as well have said `` you 're not welcome here .
frankly , i 'm not sure when we will go back .
not so much .
im gon na sum this up quickly .
and i smell like a resturant !
wo n't go back nor will i suggest anyone go there .
horrible , maybe burgers are good , but i do not like being ignored .
the hostess is terribly rude and nasty .
the seating is horrible .
the last time i was there the food was good but really slow .
terrible customer service .
we walked in and asked for a table for two .
wait time .
something to drink ( even after ordering drinks it took over _num_ minutes ) .
nothing particularly good to say about the food .
it was fine , i guess , but why is it so expensive ?
location : kinda lousy , service : kinda lousy , food : kinda meh .
why bother ?
after our lunch both of us felt really bad .
after our lunch both of us felt really bad .
never said a word never put down her phone .
worst service ever .
the worker over there is rude !
this place has the worst service ever .
worst place ever !
too expensive for what it is .
the ham was just awful and there was way too much cheese .
no bike rack , so brought bike in .
did not allow it and could not offer an alternative location .
usually go in car , but no more .
unlike the poster below i did n't find them particularly polite or apologetic .
unfortunately i also think that language is a barrier .
excessive grease is used .
also , avoid goin on the thursday nights .
they have a stupid live band .
however , as time went on , the food quality slowly started to slip .
no bread , no water , no hello , nothing .
however , too little , too late .
nothing of that is left , the memories barely .
of course , we expected a small piece of freshly cooked tuna .
my stomach did n't thank me .
bottom line : avoid like the plague .
bad .
you could n't pay me to go back .
i miss the old downtown champaign location .
my friend and i had the saffron risotto and it was horrible .
it was n't creamy , in fact , it was soupy and bland .
the shrimp was overcooked and tough .
worse , i could n't even taste a hint of saffron .
needless to say we were not impressed .
the pasta was of an unappetizing soft texture and the dish was overly greasy .
the prosciutto tasted more like salted pork .
their only redeeming feature was the crab cake appetizer .
the meal started with bread , olive oil , and cheese for the dipping .
for my appetizer , i chose the sausage in crust .
the small side of greens was nicely dressed but rather limp .
the latter was fine , the former was nothing special .
slowest service i 've ever had in my life .
the hostess was the one who helped us .
took _num_ minutes to get our food after we ordered .
spent _num_ hours in the place ... was n't even crowded .
we asked for a discount and what did we get ... _num_ % .
we saved _num_ dollars after spending _num_ hours of our time there .
the food is a pale ghost of its former self .
the pasta is often over cooked .
the sauces which used to be very special have become indifferent .
worst service i have ever received at a subway .
this is the worst subway in champaign-urbana !
it was not spicy and i had pepper jack cheese on it .
i will avoid this subway until they get this problem resolved .
night at _num_ pm to pick up a sandwich .
the place was empty .
the nice guy behind the counter told me they were out of tuna salad .
the whole attitude was bizarre .
well , it 's the next day and it looks like garbage .
there is no way that i can go to work with this .
avoid this dude at all costs .
the bar is dark and a little dusty .
the drinks are worth trying but it is not great .
so , i ca n't study or do research while in there .
not cool .
i miss this place .
not that that is a bad thing for college .
not worth it .
honestly i would never go back to this bar .
however , the place is pretty nasty .
even when you do get served , it appears everything is really expensive .
$ _num_ for a bottle of miller lite ?
loud , but good music ?
full of disrespectful and dirty kids .
and there is no way to get out of line either .
avoid !
oh , except this party also charges $ _num_ cover .
snobby and pretentious .
drinks are very weak .
too loud to hear anything .
not a fan , at all .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i effing hate this place .
all around sloppy .
extremely poor staff .
racist behavior .
i agree , quite likely the worst subway on the planet .
the employees do not care _num_ % about you , or your order .
it 's old technology and it needs to die .
but its too expensive .
one good thing is that the drinks are ridiculously cheap .
shots are $ _num_ , pitchers can be as low as $ _num_ .
the employees were incredibly rude and were just standing in the ladies room .
their food was typical and not memorable and the beer is only okay .
given the choice , i would choose other bars over joe 's .
no thank you .
the waitress , i know not her name , was incredibly rude and inattentive .
hello , rude waitress .
nobody tipped , and the food was lukewarm by the time she served us .
what a horrible waitress .
she really should be fired .
service was horrible from the start .
second biggest problem is that nothing comes out at the same time .
only _num_ waters came out , before the best _num_ .
also , between each visit from our waitress , there is a long wait .
only thing worth anything was their perfect onion rings .
it 's also unfortunate that their _num_ bud light draft special was broken .
if you really want to try this place come for half off burgers .
i 'm thoroughly disappointed .
needless to say we wo n't be back anytime soon .
one of the worst bars on campus .
like there are much worse things going on at this campus than this .
if your not _num_ do n't even bother showing up .
that sucks .
it can be good , it can be bad .
never attempt to order food for delivery from here .
it will take well over an hour and be ice cold and mushy .
there is much better sober food .
meh .
worse yet they keep very inconsistent hours when students are away .
horrible food , only slightly more mexican than taco bell .
also pretty much identical to chipotle , which might be slightly better .
not worth the price .
also the lines at lunchtime can be ridiculous , which is sad .
on top of that , their hours are all over the place .
never any lines to worry about here !
horrible .
and my lettuce was rotten , wilted and brown .
makes me wonder whether the meat is beyond its expiration date too .
an empty restaurant like qdoba speaks for itself .
i waited _num_ minutes and no one ever showed up to open the shop .
no phone call either .
wo n't be trying this place again .
scam artists , plain and simple .
this place is just alright .
she has a technique where the shots do not hurt too bad .
like many other reviewers , i have suffered some bad experiences at champaign dental .
i will avoid them all as well .
do n't trust this place .
i am glad i checked with another dentist first !
do not go to champaign dental !
it 's terrible .
convinced me i needed a cap , i did n't .
my first visit i went for normal x-ray and cleaning covered by insurance .
she proceeds to tell me that today 's visit is $ _num_ .
_num_ weeks later i 'm back to get the filling replaced .
she of course proceeds to charge me as if that phone called never happened .
i do n't even know where to begin .
probably at least _num_ years ago .
no braces needed .
no cavities .
stay away from these money hungry thieves !
going to have records transferred elsewhere .
stay away from these money hungry thieves !
going to have records transferred elsewhere .
she made this clear _num_ times .
a desperate excuse ) .
horrible customer service and do not care about their patients .
i wish i can give zero star !
i should have read the reviews here before i went there for _num_ times .
rainbow garden is basically all talk and no walk .
go to peking garden instead .
i ate it because i was hungry .
there was hardly any flavor .
like really gross .
the other dish had no flavor really .
the crab rangoon were good though a little too cream cheesy .
probably not .
the service is rude here .
in short : food is decent but service is horrible .
it went smooth enough though , and my order came fast , within minutes .
i probably could have done better at home .
so disappointed .
the biggest problem is their service .
that was extremely rude and i was quite offended by it .
food was greasy as hell .
how do you mess up a fried rice ?
i ate it with my chopsticks .
this is a review for their sunday night trivia .
_num_ max per team ; you pick your team name .
there are breaks for bathroom etc .
it was bad .
it was really just pico de gallo with more cucumbers .
not a soup but more of a raw salsa with large chunks .
i hated this place .
i 'm still out $ _num_ to them , three days later .
i paid $ _num_ for two bottles of pbr at this point .
so , i 'm not too pleased with the place .
later my cleared bank statement says the jerk gave himself a $ _num_ tip !
that is not ok !
i 'm not .
and it 's loud .
it 's not though .
now i avoid it like that plague .
what the hell ?
some weird management decisions at this place .
my margarita tasted like orange juice ... no hint of a margarita : ( .
horrible experience !
not an honest business .
will not be returning .
bartender was super rude .
not kidding .
waitress could not tell us anything about the beers on tap .
she said she was n't a beer drinker .
hubby gave up and ordered scotch .
it was watery pico de gallo .
gross .
i can understand having a bad day , but that woman is just terrible .
the store itself is not the worst but it seems a little dirty .
in my opinion , make the trip to green onion instead .
the lady working this place is very ignorant and rude !
there 's nothing good in here .
go to other asian stores cause this one will waste your time .
the most gross place i 've ever stayed .
some of these were new & never before worn .
the van will not take you anywhere .
rooms not ready , manager rude and did not offer any sort of concession .
disappointing service .
the common areas were really filthy .
room layout dumb .
bathroom was _num_ x _num_ tops .
large room space just laid out terribly .
door is in the middle of the entry wall so very inefficient layout .
finish line , you stink .
to which ... i said , `` no .
it was like i was invisible , y'all .
i walked over .
worst shopping experience ever .
i was waiting someone to help me with some pick-up stuff .
the associates saw me waiting but just walking towards the other way .
seems like i am not the only one .
the store just sucks .
it was a saturday night , when the bar is super crowded .
anyway , you order your food to the bartenders .
i do n't like the idea .
the greek one was a disaster .
it was supposed to have sausage , but i could n't taste any .
a juicy pizza is not my favorite .
but it went to terrible after yesterday .
i went with two friends to have some drinks and pizza .
the dude listened to us and in short said , `` too bad !
terrible service !
not worth it one bit !
murphy 's pub , the blind pig , and others .
there is no personality .
i 'm not entirely sure why , as this makes an awkward eating experience .
these things had enough salt to turn lake michigan into a salt lake .
they were awful .
i would not go back at all .
shared fries , fried potstickers , pizza and chicken tenders .
either that or i was starving - probably the latter .
the server was a bit pushy and had an attitude .
she was out her damn mind yelling at us like she was crazy !
the way this woman acted was completely rude and unprofessional .
wish i could give this place _num_ stars .
yeah , it 's that bad .
i will not be coming back !
i have dietary restrictions and i need to be picky .
the salmon only cost $ _num_ and it was a fairly big portion .
the servers were nice but the atmosphere was too load .
i do n't know why i bothered trying a second time .
so my main complaint about the lunch dining experience is sanitation .
wash your hands if you still decide to go .
okay , that 's not a big deal .
i guess i 'm just not used to this feel .
will not return or recommend anyone else visits this establishment .
the food was average , nothing like what the other reviews here say .
we visited due to the outstanding yelp reviews , but were extremely disappointed .
if you like pizza bites , well heck , then dig in .
not only that , but food takes forever to come out .
just awful .
but of course , this also sounds like a pretty horrible idea .
i get home and they had charged me _num_ dollars .
epic fail on their part , last time i go to that dive .
but the pizza is much too small for the price .
just not cool .
lousy service !
difficult to do when there are no tables available .
hard to get service .
ordered a house salad w/ no cucumbers & no croutons .
salad # _num_ came out with no onions .
trying to flag down my server was difficult .
pizza came , it was ok , but crust was tough .
this place charges a fee of $ _num_ to do basically nothing .
they lost my plates in the mail .
the time it takes for them to process the paper work is ridiculous .
avoid !
looks like i 'll need to pick up a lawyer .
this place is ridiculous .
however it was such a disappointment .
i want to cry because my hair was so ugly !
not worth it .
horrible heating system .
actually i do not even want to give one start for this place .
such a bad place and such bad management .
have lived in apartment in so many states and they are the worst .
this place was a bit of a disappointment for me .
i was so incredibly disappointed .
their mashed potatoes were very much like the kind you make from a box .
i ca n't help but feel this restaurant has fooled many .
i suppose the entire visit was lackluster .
i do n't see what all the fuss is about .
i lived in chicago for many years so maybe i 'm spoiled .
i waited for _num_ minutes even though i had a reservation .
all in all , not the greatest .
you 've been warned .
the atmosphere is great , but the food is too buttery and overpriced .
prix fixe dinner for two with the cheapest bottle of wine on the menu .
we left hungry , and shaking our heads .
table of _num_ , we all ordered tasting menu with wine pairings .
water was slow to be refilled .
table of _num_ , we all ordered tasting menu with wine pairings .
water was slow to be refilled .
however , i was really disappointed with the our dinner .
my steak was n't very tender or all that flavorful .
my recommendation is avoid because there is way too much attitude here .
it was a very unpleasant dinner .
a good restaurant is not just about food , but also about ambience .
the soup was also extremely salty .
the portions on the other hand ... ridiculous .
did n't knock my socks off .
we walked bye and the place was empty .
two tables total seated eating .
after _num_ people and much talking they sat us .
service was extremely slow .
not sure what they consider booked .
not worth the money .
also , i found the couscous bland .
best part was the hummus , which i was wishing they served more of .
goat cheese potato pancakes were crisp , but lacked seasoning .
i am not impressed with this place .
sure , we walk past several empty tables and sit at the empty bar .
it took quite awhile for just the drinks to get delivered .
when the food arrived , it was alright .
it was okay food , just not as tasty as i 've had elsewhere .
sure , why not .
my friend said the cake tasted like deli meat to her .
it tasted out right burnt to me .
she was sincere , it was just annoying .
i was n't impressed with the food , and somewhat unhappy with the service .
i do n't know if i would recommend this place .
completely flat .
it 's really not good .
bartender _num_ : what is going on here .
me : this tastes like corn syrup .
have you tried it .
it 's not like we can serve it to someone else .
it would be different if there was something wrong with it .
but sure enough , _num_ minutes later all our food arrives at once .
that 's a shame .
oh radio maria , how i wish we could be in love .
you have half of your restaurant empty and those are all reserved ?
ok , i 'll bite .
sure , i do n't mind that this one has food spilled on it .
the sangria here is awful .
the food is greasy and not in a good way .
the only thing good was the goat cheese .
but it is goat cheese .
how can you mess that up ?
but , i think the tapas side is just terrible .
the biggest issue was that we were served the spanish tortilla omelet refrigerator cold .
not grilled then put in the fridge over the weekend !
not me !
my problem is i remember how much better it once was .
the staff always act like you 're wasting their time .
my first disappointment was in the size of the menu .
awful place .
the potatoes and chorizo came in an extremely small portions and where bland .
overall i left that place with $ _num_ less and still hungry .
not worth the money and the food was a complete disappointment .
the only reason this place is getting two stars is because of their drinks .
pity to see an old favorite fall this far .
my husband and i recently ate at radio maria for dinner .
on a friday afternoon , i was one of six sitting at the bar .
i have tried radio maria on visits to cu .
lunch on one trip was nothing short of inedible .
dinner one night was nice but over priced .
the food seems uninspired and the quality of ingredients is average .
i am giving this restaurant _num_ stars .
i do n't want anyone else wasting their money at this establishment .
the food we ordered which was on a nearby table , was also covered .
worse yet , the manager only refunded us the cost of one cheese plate .
the deep fried house potatoes were delish .
however , the service we got was unacceptable .
fill our water glasses ) , etc .
the restaurant is also extremely noisy .
it was very tough and he said it was inedible .
the food was awful .
you could smell and taste the garlic in everything .
the service was incredibly slow .
after the wait i was expecting greatness but this restaurant did not deliver .
eggs were over salted and the presentation was not appealing .
it was stiff and hard to chew .
this is unbelievable .
will definitely not be recommending this establishment to anyone .
we ordered _num_ tapas to split between us .
had brunch here and was recommended lobster eggs benedict .
i also tried their caprese omelet and it was too garlicky .
i would n't go there for their brunch .
just got up and walked out on mother 's day .
reservation does n't mean you are getting a seat !
does she not know what the word reservation mean ?
i 've eaten here on average of around eight times a year since _num_ .
some of the menu dishes are downright bad by any standard .
a vanilla cream sauce does n't complement goat cheese , for example .
it is n't interesting .
it 's just kind of awful .
the worse store ever in costumer service !
crystal is the worse !
it is usually pretty empty , lunch or dinner time .
the falafel ended up a little dry and the little leave wraps were sour .
maybe i should try the shwarma instead .
the quality of the food is inconsistent .
the guy who works there seems very stressed and angry .
rest of food being mediocre .
just not worth going !
menu on yelp states lentil soup is made with olive oil .
there will be no soup for me here !
i would n't get it again .
overall , i was disappointed having spent almost $ .
this place was way worse than what i expected .
we ended up paying $ _num_ for _num_ people without any drinks .
i 'm never coming back to this place .
overpriced for a small portion and bland .
my mistake .
there was also a cigarette burn in my blanket .
the manager just charged me for one day , but it was horrible !
low price was the main attraction .
place was noisy , and needs complete renovation .
manager was sarcastic , toward any complaints .
there was no refrigerator , microwave , or breakfast .
do n't even bother .
the rate may be cheap but it 's still too much .
there was even a bug smashed and stuck on the wall .
i ca n't believe housekeeping would even consider this clean .
_num_ stars for being gross .
like sketchy gross .
not worth the value .
front desk staff is friendly but otherwise this place is a complete bust .
dirty room , rude staff , overpriced .
sleep in the park ; it 's cleaner .
that 's coming from a _num_ yr old , and we all agreed .
also , garbage was overflowing in the breakfast area .
tv was old - not a flat screen .
the hotel is filthy and not taken care of .
the staff and management is even worse .
worst decision you could make !
and do n't forget rude staff , that was the cherry on top !
sleep in your car , you 'll have a better experience .
my mom and i stayed here for _num_ nights .
Negative
if i could rate this as a negative _num_ star i would .
we stayed only one night here .
we would not visit here again .
i checked in , walked down to my room , and let myself in .
this was an improvement .
i go down , and yes , it 's better looking .
there 's no toilet seat !
it 's broken off and thrown under the sink .
this room is fine , he says .
i go down to the room , and it passes my quick inspection .
twenty minutes later , i realize the room is no warmer .
i check the heating unit and it 's blowing cold air .
this place is a hell hole .
one star only because zero stars is not an option .
this hotel is dirty and smells bad .
management is friendly but everything needs cleaned .
the pool , the hallways , the bathrooms .
did n't dare even try the free breakfast .
do n't use this company .
also technician accidentally dropped a bunch of chemicals in our yard in a pile .
a lot of chemicals in one pile results in dead grass .
never ever use this company .
worse , communication with this company is a nightmare .
someone at the company is making the application record up or cooking the book .
)
selection a bit limited and noisy when busy .
wait , restaurant ... cook my own food ?
the prices are absolutely ridiculous .
the salad bar was very poor .
very limited selection , and the food looked old and wilted .
still , our waitress was never around .
not a good sign for the quality of food to say the least .
all and all , i wo n't be going back here .
cheap meat , crap salad bar , just awful .
very sad .
we were sadly very disappointed .
the steak itself was nothing special and for a fillet it was pretty fatty .
the place is outdated and dirty .
the food was awful .
the steaks had no flavor and were chewy .
i would not recommend .
i can make a better steak at home for half the price .
waste of time .
there were _num_ in our party .
it was an ok experience .
i guess i am not in a huge hurry to go back .
the disappointing aspect was that the steaks were so bland .
the baked potato was actually really good yet the salad bar was nothing special .
the place seemed okay but was dirty and the lighting was terrible imho .
probably would n't go back .
service , worse every visit .
additionally , the topping options got the baked potato was lacking .
steak was under cook .
wait for _num_ minutes .
and never see my sever again .
i give _num_ star cuz chef bring steak back to me .
if not , i wo n't give any thing .
just driving through the area and had to stop for the night .
the decor made me think it would be much more affordable than it was .
i mean , vinyl tablecloths at a steakhouse ?
no steak for me .
i ate 1/2 of the serving and left the rest .
they were gummy and flavorless .
the salad bar was unremarkable , but not bad .
in my mind a reservation at _num_ means you get seated around _num_ .
why not seat people at those tables ?
it was just super chaotic and unprofessional .
no you did n't .
we should 've just gone there to begin with .
i had not been here for several years .
way too expensive for what you get .
my meal was $ _num_ for a fillet they cook .
the meat was fine the salad bar was empty there had been _num_ buses .
$ _num_ for half a glass of wine .
their salesperson is too pushy and followed up around .
carpet is too expensive compared to other places .
it 's normally really dirty in there too.
where in this list do you see peanuts ?
actually , i guess that is what i 'm saying .
shit never went down like that in california .
overpriced and bland .
if i closed my eyes i would n't be able to tell them apart .
the only flavor that seems to be good here is the chocolate .
otherwise , save your money and your time and just go somewhere else .
it did not live up to all the fuss .
they guy that took our order clearly had no clue what he was doing .
even then it took forever for our order to be made .
on the other hand , i ended up literally drinking it .
i have nothing against this custard place .
however , in my humble fat opinion , custard sucks .
it is just not that good of a dairy dessert .
anyway , not my thing .
absurd wait time .
no business this inefficient should be around .
the service is so slow it 's ridiculous .
it 's an okay product but the service is unbearable .
the owners could n't care less that there far better ways to do things .
hire _num_ more people .
one person , takes orders and money , another makes the order .
the time would be cut b _num_ % .
it takes way to long to get through the line .
long wait for ok ice cream .
if i had to imagine the most depressing place it is here .
we did not have a good experience there .
i have received poor service from this kfc location many times .
ranging from no napkins at the drive-thru ( a big pet peeve of mine !
gross ! )
ridiculous they are that slow .
the fries had a stale chemical taste .
terrible .
amazingly , worse than i expected .
worst .
i hate chain restaurants .
every time i 've been here , i 've been unsatisfied .
my last experience here was my worst .
waited in the drive thru for _num_ minutes as the only car .
if it were only me , i would have laughed and drove away .
certainly not convenient , cheap , or tasty .
i do n't believe any positive reviews came from actual customers .
worst kfc experience ever !
instead of two meals they only had one .
i gave my order again two more times , each time slowly .
this place is really bad !
and you forgot the lettuce and the tomatoes are tasteless .
terrible terrible employees , worst customer service i 've received in a while .
slow service .
meanwhile my sandwich is just sitting there on the counter .
next time i should go to jimmy johns .
very poor customer service here , especially displayed by store manager angela .
i 'm the customer standing here ready to make a purchase .
the pizza was n't horrible , but the deal was awful .
low rating is for price vs. quality , and value .
way too greasy , and it was definitely stale , old grease .
ended up throwing half the pizza out because it just tasted so bad .
cheese only was edible , but anything we had with toppings was bad .
worst customer service ever !
the manager jason is very rude and does n't take ownership for his mistakes .
this one i on the worst list .
but service is lacking big time .
not a single smile or hello when we walked in the door .
i would give them a zero if i could .
the manager hung up on me when i was trying to report an issue .
worst service ever .
what a way to make it right , wrong !
u could tell the guy who answered the phone was pissed off .
no thanks !
worst manager experience ever !
would n't give us our total for delivery .
duh the pizza was great but this manager should n't work with the public .
when i received my ready to pick up prompt , i drove over .
only pizza was ready .
i arrived home and the pizza was still wrong .
needless to say our dinner was ruined .
th fish was over cooked .
only eat here if you are stuck in this building and pressed for time .
horrible .
lots of angry people were getting out of their cars to investigate .
ridiculous .
unprofessional rude staff .
did n't even go hang around the under _num_ section downstairs .
just kidding , i would never do that .
do n't waste your night there !
$ _num_ cover , no hats , and they steal your id .
how is this garbage still in business ?
i bit my tongue .
this place is a joke .
call me crazy but is n't there anywhere in phoenix to dance .
the staff was so rude !
1st door guy said we could come in for free anytime fri night .
the place was ghetto and empty .
sorry sky lounge , you suck .
expired and bad .
same thing .
terrible service .
do n't get beer here .
_num_ star is more than this place deserves .
the staff was horrible .
i would never go back to this place again .
today is monday and i am still sick .
i would give zero stars if it were an option .
if i could give this place zero stars , i would .
that 's got to be the most annoying shit ever !
both times the place was dead .
omg , i 'm sooooo sad .
i 'm such an individual i need to look like everyone else ... .
absolutely horrible place !
these guys deserve better than that .
every time i have been , the bar has been understaffed .
it 's almost as if this is a bare bones establishment .
and certainly not $ _num_ for a ten minute inspection .
not a great way to build a relationship .
and these guys totally failed .
hours it takes to swap them out ?
still not good enough .
i know a little something about cars .
my uncle has been a mechanic for over _num_ years .
i took my car to virginia auto service for a very specific issue .
they called me with a totally different problem the cost to fix was outrageous .
i repeated what i needed and they told me no , no , no .
chuck 's speed shop did my block work @ $ _num_ .
i had already changed the fuel filter .
i 'm not sure how much these guys know about anything .
their shop rate is $ _num_ .
chuck 's speed shop did my block work @ $ _num_ .
i had already changed the fuel filter .
i 'm not sure how much these guys know about anything .
their shop rate is $ _num_ .
i was not impressed once .
no spice .
no life .
no business from me .
recently went back with a party of _num_ for a bday celebration .
it was only downhill from there .
_num_ min to get drink orders , another _num_ to get the drinks .
another _num_ min later he took our food orders .
_num_ min later they started coming out , sort of .
do n't think i 'll go back to dine in - ever .
bad choice .
that said , i must admit that the fried banana dessert was delicious !
the waitress could have been quite a bit more attentive .
you ca n't take care of takeout and dining customers ?
customer service at it 's worst !
service was the worst i have ever experienced .
i have n't and will not go back .
the lady on the phone said it was not an issue .
the hostess said it would be _num_ minutes for a table .
literally two seconds later , there was a four person table cleared .
the place was busy and noisy .
the menu was limited and average priced for most items .
the hubby had the bbq chicken with coconut rice .
so sadly we will not be returning .
very mediocre .
after no response , i went in ordered food .
food was delivered _num_ minutes later .
then adding insult to injury the food was bland when it arrived .
not worth the time or money solid _num_ stars .
mediocre thai food .
nothing bad but nothing special .
it was mostly broth with few veggies .
the green papaya salad was bland needing more lime juice .
disappointing experience .
the cheesy _num_ 's radio station did n't help .
as soon as she entered she was met by a thai staff member .
what is up with crappy customer service in this town ?
his response , `` ohhh sorry !
i could n't believe it .
i got charged $ _num_ for a dish we could n't even eat .
totally lame .
a manager did n't even come over to try to smooth this issue out .
i left nothing for the tip considering they were ok to rip me off .
i wo n't be back .
my wife and i were very excited to try this place based on reviews .
the staff was very nice , but a little slow it seemed .
my wife told me that her seafood panang was relatively bland .
no offer to refund the meal was offered .
very disappointing .
a few other issues with service but minor compared to routine food poisoning .
the manager refunded my entire tip in cash .
have n't been back and will likely never return .
unfortunately the service was absolutely appalling .
she took even longer to collect the bill and run our card .
extremely disappointed with my experience and i will not be coming back .
there were only three couples inside including us .
the service was unacceptable .
from the moment my friend and i entered the restaurant the experience was bad .
it took a long time for us to get water or our drinks .
impossible .
eventually our entrees came , i ordered soup , it was n't good .
it was almost impossible to manage .
then our check came , he overcharged us .
the restaurant was not busy , it was typical for a wednesday night .
there is no excuse for their wait times or rudeness .
really disappointed - place is not as good as it used to be .
the hostess was nowhere to be seen .
ten minutes pass .
no sign of the hostess .
other people have arrived and walked out as well .
maybe they 'd get one of the still empty tables .
that girl probably just cost the restaurant thousands in future business .
when the dish came out , i was so disappointed .
$ _num_ extra for two shrimps !
we were told it would be about _num_ mins .
do n't expect customer service !
if you ca n't handle the heat , then get out of the kitchen !
i could n't believe what i was hearing !
we left the restaurant and i will never return .
big fat f for this place .
the flavors and preparation is just not authentic .
disgrace .
needless to say , this was very disappointing .
two stars for service and cleanliness alone , none for food .
the food was fine but the service was atrocious .
we flagged down another employee who got the waiter .
really , where were all the servers ?
it was also disappointing to me that the bill was not clear .
they would do well to make the customer feel a little more welcoming .
the basil chicken was not much better .
watery sauce and minimal flavoring .
so , this place was my absolute favorite thai restaurant in phoenix until today .
she did n't even eat it !
we waited _num_ minutes for our food .
the wait staff was great but the management was sloppy and hands off .
it was n't busy at all , but our server was not very attentive .
a large group would not use any of these open tables .
instead my time was wasted .
i could see the owner busy cooking in the kitchen .
i would suggest she spend a little more time on the front .
why are n't you tasting the food that your cooks are putting out ?
pad thai was terrible ... very salty , not sweet at all .
i could n't believe my eyes .
two stars today for a very poor meal last night .
its not that great .
the chicken pad thai is pretty decent , but i have had better .
my second trip here was not great at all .
it was a piss poor excuse and they were n't that apologetic .
sadly .
will not be going back .
it seems like every time we come here there 's a line .
you decide which is more important .
for me , there are plenty of better thai places in the area .
but the service is so bad that it hardly makes up for it .
so we walk in , it 's not very busy .
she looked at me like i said something foreign and refused and said no .
she did n't answer , gave me a dirty look and we walked out .
i 've never experienced anything like that .
absolute horrendous customer service .
in _num_ degree heat , we were refused .
even more , i am disappointed that the staff behavior was so appalling .
the food is terrible .
pad thai is mediocre at best .
the peanut sauce is more like gravy then sauce , thick and gritty .
over all it was a poor experience .
two waitresses ignored us , one cleaning a table that was obviously not needed .
she said she would get a hostess .
terrible service !
cold .
terrible service !
waited _num_ min for a cold dinner .
poor table service !
we went on a saturday night and there were plenty of tables available .
ca n't complain about the chicken pad thai because it was great .
i ordered chicken pad thai .
it was mediocre and the service was bad .
when i asked her for chopsticks , she just walked away .
only because i ca n't give them _num_ stars .
they really need to get it together .
supposedly they do not take reservations , but they were unable to seat us .
i left barely eating the dish .
not worth taking anything home .
went there with a group i 'm in .
gross !
disappointing to say the least !
poorly handled from start to finish .
too bad , because i 've heard good things about this place .
Negative
i 'm disappointed .
the rice was n't fresh .
but over all i 'll most likely not go here again .
service was terrible !
we drove _num_ hours from sedona to eat here .
total of _num_ people together .
our disappointment is in how the wait staff was directed to assist the customer .
poor service .
waitress was rude and avoided my inquire of service .
i had to wait _num_ minutes to get food .
i wo n't be back .
my husband got the worst haircut ever today from jackie .
very misleading and deceptive .
oh well take my business elsewhere .
not worth driving _num_ minutes for this type of treatment .
first of all , this is horrible advice .
there were two things that really bothered me about my appointment .
i will not go back here again .
i 'm very disappointed .
i am _num_ years old .
i do not recommend central phoenix !
my experience was terrible .
her reply , `` yup , i do n't know what to tell you .
unbelievable .
never , ever have i been so appalled .
i rescheduled but after this i plan to never go back .
thank you for your reply to this _num_ months later .
so glad this nightmare is behind me .
keep in mind , this was the 1st time i had met her .
just know that your patients surely do miss you .
the buffet was smaller than most but that was n't a big deal .
the problem was the dry and hard food .
the beds were comfortable .
they have a pool , a jacuzzi , and a workout room .
the staff is n't so great .
it was a roof over our heads .
it is not a great hotel .
on top of that the pull out bed was uncomfortable as hell !
stupid short bed .
it 's been robbed on _num_ different occasions while i was shopping there .
( he would n't run his store safeway card for me ! )
their change machine was down for well over a week !
`` hello , did you find everything you are looking for today ? ''
`` oh , sorry too here that . ''
`` no , just seeing if you need assistance . ''
the cashier 's are often super slow and not very friendly .
seems like half the time i go there they do n't have it .
it was really rude and unprofessional .
another thing , the starbucks thing is ridiculous .
did we really need another one ?
it pains me to say , this safeway is horrible .
does n't corporate come by every once and a while ?
every time i go , they 're out of something .
i '' m talking basics .
bread , milk , soda .
it is atrocious .
not anymore .
i just do n't ever recall that a sandwich required silverware .
the time prior , i went and they were out of tomatoes .
walk over to the produce and pick up a tomato !
`` no !
but sadly , it 's the closest store to my downtown office .
this safeway is ghetto ... for arizona .
none of the employees are helpful nor friendly .
the products are all grossly overpriced .
this is a terrible location .
very random and sketchy .
the huge problem here , is everything else .
it makes for an unsafe situation for everyone .
it really seems like this store just does n't give a shit .
at each opportunity to impress , the complete opposite happens .
the last time was my last time ever walking into either safeway store .
i do n't know how they get away with selling moldy fruits and vegetables .
can i give this _num_ stars ?
i am so disappointed in this safeway and will not return .
i hate this safeway .
there are never enough cashiers .
i could n't believe it .
nothing worse than you 'd find in the sf bay area .
quit being so stuck up .
hands down worst safeway in phx !
this is the worst staffed safeway in the valley .
it 's that bad .
_num_ ) what carts you ask ?
yes , only two , despite there being _num_ or _num_ total checkout lanes .
oh , and there may or may not be trash on the floor .
on top of it all customer service was rude .
bad experience all around !
_num_ out of _num_ times , i am overcharged .
on my last _num_ visits it was for over $ _num_ .
unfortunately , this safeway is a few blocks from my house .
we all have bad days .
as i looked up , i noticed the _num_ items or less sign .
i apologized and was only met with more attitude .
there were _num_ .
what the hell is that smell inside the store ?
this probably the worst grocery store i 've ever been to .
the way he responded gave me a sour feeling about the customer service .
but it seems to be quite busy .
checking out sucks so much .
got overcharged , after a few minutes got so mad i left .
keep the $ _num_ , y'all need it more than me !
pathetic at best .
Neutral
the third negative was that most of the food was not good at all .
not good .
they brought out corn and flour tortillas with the fajitas .
overall , food was bad .
did i mention they did n't give us silverware ?
went here for dinner with a group of _num_ .
too extreme for me .
not too bad , not great either .
sorry sam 's but this will be my first and last time .
as it turned our , i should have listened to my stomach .
ca n't beat that ... except maybe with a couple of rounds of patron .
not as good as i had hoped .
strange menu : pasta , but no burritos .
had the chicken quesadilla , and did n't care much for it .
the only good thing was the chips ... not going back .
minus : way too salty .
everything except the salad had far more salt than necessary or even reasonable .
without cilantro and he still said no .
it was really a terrible experience .
nasty .
my stomach hurts .
absolutely the worst service i 've ever seen .
they had no flavor , and the tortillas were hard .
poor form .
very disappointing .
poor service , we actually had to get our menus ourselves .
not a good experience - go somewhere else .
the food is mediocre .
five minutes later my waitress returns asking me what i ordered .
... ... ... .
this place is a headache .
it looks like something i could have created using visual basic in high school .
_num_ stars only because of the margaritas .
positives :
because the food came out so late we had to get it boxed up .
not one , but two roaches crawling on the table .
and the energy is not good , very off !
would n't recommend eating here !
the service was slow waitress did not know the menu or the ingredients .
how very disappointing .
but that is not going to be enough to win back the meal .
ate there last night for one reason , the fabulous location .
i think our server was just too busy with three other relatively big tables .
she was helpful and asked if she could get us anything else .
just too many other good places in the area to eat .
staff was rude and obnoxious .
also , they close very early no matter what their hours say .
most likely will not be back .
group decision , not a personal preference to return .
first thing , both nights , the service was extremely slow .
i had the chicken fajitas night _num_ .
the chicken was really dry and had an abundance of unnecessary seasoning on it .
drinks were week , and service at the bar was terrible .
seriously , not worth your time .
not happy at all and definitely not coming back .
even to get our waters took a long time .
i was definitely not impressed at all .
aside for my plate taking _num_ minutes to get served , it was cold .
that first round was really weak , by the way .
chicken ?
wo n't be back .
the food was mainly cold and the steak fajitas were rubbery .
ummm ... in a word , no !
taste was lackluster .
if there was i could n't taste it .
no cheddar cheese , no guacamole , no beans .
bill was $ _num_ , which i thought was fair .
long wait with super rude host .
terrible service - period .
i 'm not the server ; i 'm the paying patron .
they closed early and are not reliable .
never going back .
we were a group of _num_ for dinner our poor waiter had no help .
the food was terrible !
i treated my mom and aunt to lunch .
the wings were ok , pretty greasy & nothing spectacular .
not very busy on a monday night .
a table of _num_ hungry guys did n't finish either appetizer .
sadly , canyon cafe just does n't cut it .
my coworker got the ahi tuna southwestern salad and he rated it 4/5 stars .
the crust was tasty but i hardly ate any of the cake itself .
i probably wo n't be back .
we even had a hard time getting our check so we could leave .
mediocre food .
mediocre service .
food was great , sw cobb salad is amazing but the service was horrible .
$ _num_ salad , i can get that somewhere else with much better service .
we were not greeting with a warm welcome .
the hostess was very rude to me and the others in my party .
we waited another _num_ minutes for those .
the teeter house is a trip , like no other .
it took _num_ hour for everybody to get their food .
and the room temperature needed some adjustment for a phoenix summer day .
not my cup of tea !
no plates at first , the tea was nothing to write home about .
the scones a bit dry and the jam , maybe walmart strawberry .
the worst was the dessert .
everything manages to have a bitter taste that i just can not explain .
still the place is usually crowded .
what 's worse is they 're usually rude about it .
lastly , they do n't honor coupons the correct way .
but has a problem with someone buying someone food when they are hungry .
shame shame !
now it will be another _num_ years before through a drive through again .
please check your order before you leave the driver through window .
you may well find they have charged you for warmed over garbage .
this place does so-so to the max .
over-priced , small portions , mediocre service .
this one might be among the worst i have seen .
it 's okay .
oh for the love of god this place is boring .
and there seems to be interactive things for kids too !
i like a lot of museums in phoenix .
the place was insanely overcrowded for the small space .
it did n't begin at 5:30 like we were informed .
the margaritas were too strong to enjoy .
so you ate and that was it .
i was expecting more , so i was disappointed .
extremely disappointed in this museum .
let 's start with positives ...
- concessions , a dumpy little espresso kiosk ?
i have a feeling , that these folks , are volunteers .
i did n't know they were n't the same as the other seats .
these seats are very uncomfortable !
the ladies bathroom is pretty and clean but was designed terrible .
however , i was terribly disappointed with the seating .
this , to me , was not necessary .
ridiculous .
it 's cheap , it 's fast , the name is familiar ?
i once went _num_ years without eating at a taco bell .
why did i try it again ?
the set up is terrible .
avoid like the plague .
- the place was total sausage fest .
like _num_ dudes to one girl .
- worst fish and chips imaginable .
- hot wings , surprisingly , we 're okay .
- philly cheesesteak sandwich - ick .
- cole slaw , more like sugar slaw .
vote elsewhere .
$ _num_ just is n't worth it though .
i assumed she was going to get silverware .
but then i did n't see her again until she brought the hamburger .
there were so many things wrong at this time .
especially seeing that i have _num_ children under the age of _num_ .
there was nothing on it .
she just brought over the hamburger on one plate with no extras .
at this point i was so annoyed and tired and wanted to leave .
i did n't even want to bother complaining and waiting to get more food .
after a long day , i just wanted to leave .
but i would never come back again .
my meal was not put in the system .
i 'm not really fond of writing sub par reviews .
probably not .
it 's not like they were busy .
we just left and went to hard rock cafe .
the atmosphere is not casual and the place is not very inviting .
the hostess was not friendly and neither was the staff inside .
ive never had even mediocre service there .
everyone looked like they were working hard to make everyone happy .
the food was gross .
drinks are cheap .
here 's the downfall .
food did n't look appetizing .
would n't be surprised .
i would stay away from there drink specials .
it may be cheap but thats because there 's no alcohol !
with the shot it came out to $ _num_ .
they ordered another drink special in hopes it would be better .
fail .
sad to say but they returned it .
ridiculous expensive drink prices ... $ _num_ for a double tall vodka soda .
needless to say i was so disappointed .
wow , what a disappointment !
i was not impressed with this place .
like i said , i expected more out of this place and left disappointed .
good place to watch a game but the food is terrible .
that did not sit well with me .
another issues i had with this place was the dj .
he came over and introduced himself as the dj from chicago .
he was by far the worst dj i have ever heard .
lastly , the drinks were watered down .
very mediocre food when surrounded by a lot of great options .
it 's not .
my chicken sandwich was dry and uninspired .
the one thing that stood out was the chunky bleu cheese dressing .
otherwise , do n't see myself coming back .
lame . ''
and ... my vodka soda tasted like water .
ordered a caesar salad with grilled shrimp and a side of avocado .
the service was attentive , but not overbearing .
stopped in for a bite to eat before catching a game at chase stadium .
very disappointed .
the service was terrible .
worst experience as a mom ever !
he apologized for the error and waited on us the rest of the visit .
we would not go back .
overpriced tasteless food with a poor beer selection .
the service was ok too , but it was n't busy at all .
boy was i wrong !
i ordered the chicken sandwich with sprouts and avocado .
nothing more , nothing less .
tried some chips and salsa too .
no need to return ever again .
not on my list for a quick return .
sitting outside is nice but the speakers are annoying .
worst experience ever !
just how long does it take to cook _num_ burgers ?
after _num_ more minutes , we decided to leave .
the server came to me `` why did n't you wait _num_ more minutes ?
pathetic and unprofessional .
huge disappointment !
ordered _num_ burgers medium .
they came out extremely well done & the buns were hard & dry .
they did n't even send a manager over .
$ _num_ for an inedible meal .
we will not be back .
it was good but overcooked by two levels .
too expensive for the quality but they charge a lot due to location .
i may not be back .
nachos are chips with taco bell meat and obvious nacho cheese from a pump .
the beer selection is weak at best .
noisy and the atmosphere is more dive bar than lounge .
will avoid in the future .
worst service i 've ever had ( literally ) .
spent $ _num_ at the bar and it never got any better .
just an overall terrible experience .
the milk was bad !
there was no doubt it was well beyond its expiration date .
it was everything i could do not to get sick .
like where they serve it from should change my perspective .
the manager brought out our food and never addressed the rotten milk .
it was awful .
the beef was rubbery and had an off flavor .
the au jus was flavorless .
it was good but nothing worth going crazy over .
my biggest complaint with this restaurant was the service .
when we arrived , we told the hostess that there _num_ of us .
it just rubbed me the wrong way .
not much flavor and a dry bun .
the reason for the low rating vs average was because of _num_ things .
that is just gross .
they brought them to me very quickly .
i ordered the brownie to-go for desert ... what a waste of money .
server took almost _num_ minutes to come to table then blamed it on hostess .
who does n't have slaw with a reuben .
also , no kosher pickle .
in fact , no pickle .
went in on a very slow wednesday night .
the place was fully staffed , though , no one wanted to acknowledge us .
the experience itself was awful !
however , the cocktails are served with little or no pour .
she did n't check on refills .
the menu is kinda bad , they need more of a selection !
the roll they use for the burgers are awful !
called to make sure they could change my watch battery .
there was nothing going on inside .
friendly ... yea but my watch still does n't work .
this is why the mall gets all the business .
that the cab is still _num_ miles away !
is there a way to give zero stars ?
okay , that 's annoying but hardly the beginning of it .
i live about _num_ miles from the airport .
when i got to my apt , i called the company to complain .
the first person i spoke to was very understanding and apologetic for my experience .
absolutely one of the worst cab companies imaginable .
i will go out of my way to never use them again .
i called another cab company immediately afterwards and had absolutely no problem with them .
never calling yellow cab again .
_num_ minutes ago was told _num_ minutes .
dispatch informed someone would arrive .
i stated that was not acceptable as i had a flight to catch .
this is the worst cab service i ever experienced .
after waiting for a few minutes , i lady picked up .
i wish the company can find out who this lady was .
the site gave me a confirmation number .
the operator said she could n't get the cabs to answer them .
i would not recommend this company .
the problem seems to be from the supervisor down .
they will not take care of you if you call them with a complaint .
you do not get to speak to a manager .
they refuse to come to the phone .
can i give these guys zero stars ?
the driver ripped me off !
why would we need to see indian school road two times ?
it sure wo n't be yellow cab .
the worst customer service i have experienced in my life .
driver was very rude .
he was very angry that i did not know the direction .
he was very rude .
this is the worst cab company in whole world .
way too many fucking issues .
i said no because im already late enough because of your company .
he doesnt fucking understand i dont have time .
my recommendation is to dump this company and find other cab service companies .
Positive
i would give them a negative star if possible .
yellow cab taxi is rip off !
i have zero bad things to say about any of the drivers .
they made me feel like an idiot and that is terrible customer service .
i 'm very disappointed with the customer service at yellow cab .
worst experience ever !
i would n't recommend them to , my worst enemy .
horrible .
he refused for us to pay with a credit card .
i got out of the car to get my bags .
i will never use yellow cab again .
very poor customer service .
the operator said it was _num_ mins .
beyond frustrating !
i get downstairs in _num_ minutes .
the security guard at the front door tells me the cab just left .
i wait for another _num_ minutes .
it 's now past my original reservation time .
no apologies for the confusion , no explanation .
rates to the airport are a different rate than `` street rates '' .
i tell him i 'm not paying double the quoted rate .
he refuses to switch it .
what a train wreck .
called to ask for an additional van , were told _num_ minutes .
waited for that , called back , and a van was not available still !
avoid yellow cab like the plague .
you guys wonder why everyone is switching to uber ?
it was a mistake .
i was craving pizza .
i do not recommend .
the food is ok , nothing special but not bad .
i tried the asian , garlic buffalo and sam adams bbq .
it was all down hill from there though .
skip it !
after my last visit ( my 4th to this location ) , i quit .
perhaps i just had a bad room .
but i can name a few bad ones !
rooms and bathrooms are small .
not much privacy !
happened about once every _num_ seconds .
no control over ac : i know it 's phoenix , but come on .
overall opinion : not worth the money .
for a few bucks more i could have stayed at the hyatt or something .
will probably not be staying here again the next time i 'm in town .
not so rad .
management was horrible .
the valet did n't have a name tag .
no hot water in the morning .
gross .
sorry hotel san carlos .
while you are a charming little old hotel , you 're not for me .
so , do n't stay here if you have options .
the bar was okay but the comedy show was horrible .
on the other hand , the valet attendant exceeded my expectations .
he was very personable and helpful .
i was not pleased to hear this .
that 's just my fault .
hated it !
maybe snap your fingers too .
unfortunately , when that day arrived i was severely disappointed .
that 's the problem .
it 's just old and crappy , not historic and charming .
the king bed we upgraded to was just two small beds pushed together .
want a late checkout , no problem ... oh , wait , problem .
the night person and the morning person seem to be on different pages .
( yes , that is a legit excuse . )
( for me , not the hotel staff . )
no security at all , just a young girl behind the front desk .
the worst part is the `` manager '' .
this hotel was awful .
_num_ .
no hot water ( are you kidding ?
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
no coffee onsite , the closest was starbucks down a few blocks .
_num_ .
_num_ .
this is not worth your money or time , trust me !
small room facing the main street ( quiet though ) .
do not stay here .
no ac - this is phoenix !
the only positive was the roof deck with the pool .
next time i would stay at a nearby hotel from a national chain .
they hold an extra $ _num_ on your card in case of room damage .
it was saturday night and the dance floor was empty .
there was a somewhat weird vibe about the place but nothing really standing out .
i will probably avoid going here again , including the club .
if there was a zero star it would be more appropriate .
made a reservation through hotels.com for $ _num_ for one night stay .
finally the host comes out with the worst attitude ever .
she also wo n't call me back .
entire lack of professionalism and courtesy .
gross , just gross .
the bathroom we had was so small i was worried about getting stuck !
my mother 's room had no hair dryer or working outlet in the bathroom .
it was none less disappointing and not worth the price .
i stayed at this hotel for a conference and it was terrible !
this hotel is horrible !
i paid _num_ for one night and regret it !
i 've stayed at motel _num_ that are way better than this !
people at front desk are not friendly , borderline rude .
i really was n't impressed and i would n't stay there again .
nothing like waiting until the last minute to clean it up !
ok , now the bad part .
that 's how thin the walls are btw .
_num_ stars .
unfortunately , we were fairly disappointed .
however , we wo n't be going again .
i could n't leave fast enough - a completely disappointing experience .
the hotel also claimed to have room service and cable .
gross old hotel - not charming in any way .
the decor of the rooms is n't just dated it is downright tired .
the furniture was chipped and the walls were dingy .
at home i 'm used to a cramped _num_ year old bathroom .
when i called to correct the billing the manager was incredibly rude and unhelpful .
on top of this the front desk was rude when questioned about the billing .
again , poor management and customer service .
the hotel san carlos does not do that .
we are not talking shabby chic .
there is no customer service here .
i booked it because it was cheap .
and kinda gross .
horrible .
at least it does n't try to be what it 's not .
the price was not worth the product .
very few outlets so tough to charge up computers and phones .
none in the bathroom !
so i had to blow my hair dry in the other room .
the bathroom had a huge sink but zero counter space .
no counter in the bathroom .
the tv volume was not working and the picture was terrible .
as others have posted , the walls are quite thin .
the valet drives up in his personal car .
unfortunately , this is the worst hotel that i 've ever stayed in .
the walls are thin .
for $ _num_ per night , they should be ashamed .
there is no room service .
internet is very spotty and makes working incredibly frustrating .
not impressed .
the hotel room was not particularly clean and it was really out of date .
Neutral
the room was _num_ a night .
the pool was ice cold .
why would it even be off ?
they had water bottles in the room for _num_ a bottle .
you should not have to pay that but you had no other option .
she should only charge me like a $ _num_ .
she would not give us a discount .
very rude !
she took _num_ off for valet .
way too expensive for what you get and not worth it !
single worst experience i 've ever had at a hotel .
and suggested i spend more money to have another girl wax these areas .
worst pedicure ever .
absolutely horrible experience .
do not get jessica .
but i did n't need anything else done .
i 've never been treated that way at an aveda salon .
because of her rudeness i left and did not do my hair there .
what a waste of time !
horrible experience @ this ihop .
holy bad service !
forgot order like _num_ times .
i 've been here before but this last time i went sucked .
wo n't make that mistake again .
worst service ever !
this place does not even deserve one star .
poor , slow service .
and the manager just blew off the mistakes .
i would n't bother .
that is not natural .
i have been going to this ihop every month for _num_ years .
our group is anywhere from _num_ to _num_ .
over the past year , service has gone down hill .
`` the kept sitting people at the tables that only could accommodate large groups .
we found a new home and they will get _num_ stars on my review .
the benefit of coming here is that its open _num_ hrs .
nothing else around the area was open at 5:30 am .
and being slow .
when we sat down , we waited another _num_ min for our food .
why would soup take _num_ minutes ?
my daughter made me come but next time i 'll put my foot down .
no more ihop for me .
never going there and telling my friend avoid this location !
the service here , is sooo bad !
they were packed so i could understand a little delay , but come on !
if i could leave less than one star i would .
this place was very unclean .
no more .
poor service and dirty pretty much sums up this experience .
no lemon .
i wish i never came here !
but this place is horrible .
she was not glad to see us first of all .
our waitress came over after a good _num_ to _num_ minute wait .
it took _num_ minutes to get our order out .
waitresses bad talking customers and the manager yelling at them to pick up orders .
i feel the manager had no control .
i was really angry at this time .
the sour dough change must have really been an issue .
i eat my half sandwich , two grapes and two slices of oranges .
i could wait to leave .
not the best tip either .
do n't go here , drive to another ihop .
the worst ever !
we pull up to the parking lot which looks empty .
we go in , there are about _num_ tables of seated customers .
there is _num_ couple waiting to be seated ahead of us .
we wait about _num_ minutes to be seated .
there were only _num_ of us and plenty of _num_ person tables avail .
another 15-20 minutes goes by .
we wait and wait and wait for about _num_ minutes .
i do n't know who 's order we got but it was n't ours .
we attempted to eat some of it but it tasted horrible .
no flavor just plain bland cold rubbery eggs and bacon .
terrible .
went here this morning not really craving breakfast .
he tells me they are out of ranch dressing .
and they proceeds to say `` they '' are doing them bad this week .
my french toast was poorly made and soggy .
i feel like this is a disgrace to all breakfast restaurant .
it did not reach my satisfaction .
she also did not give us the check so we were waiting for hours .
the waitress said `` no '' .
she was not happy .
the waitress did n't even bother to bring me the check !
management needs to either train their staff better or be replaced themselves .
ridiculous !
i 've waited over _num_ min for a single order .
does it really take _num_ minutes to make some french toast ?
management and service is very poor .
ignorant servers .
literally , everybody 's order was messed up .
asked for manager and no manager ever came .
this place is ridiculous .
the chips , carne asada , and carnitas were all sub-par .
the rice was pretty good , however , as was the guacamole .
not so .
we went at lunch and the waiting area was packed !
i still judge a place by it 's beans and these were nasty .
my coworker ordered the chile relleno and chicken enchilada lunch special .
she did n't like her food either .
my husband and i got the shredded beef tacos and enchiladas .
the rice and beans were nothing special .
the main dishes arrived and they were a major disappointment !
the tacos were oily and bland .
the beans and rice were not much better .
nothing special or authentic here .
i do n't get it .
you can decide for yourself which to pick .
as for the food ... it 's horribly average .
i do n't want cheddar cheese on my mexican food .
i do n't want jack in the box style tacos .
i do n't need beans and rice on the same plate .
if not , i suggest you skip it .
sadly , i was not impressed .
the salsa was mediocre , and my chimi was soggy and tasteless .
the beans were tasteless as well .
will not be going back .
if i can give it zero star , i would .
there are _num_ of us in the group going there for a birthday lunch .
we complained the salsa was too hot and asked if she has something else .
she said there is nothing less spicy than that .
the food was n't good either .
the beans and the rice were just not good .
greasy tacos , the only thing good was the spicy salsa .
do n't understand what restaurant the other reviewers went to .
i used to frequent this restaurant until what happened to me on april 3rd .
i am totally shocked that people like this restaurant .
the chicken was good but the bagged lettuce was terrible .
the salsa was n't salsa at all just hot sauce .
the guacamole tasted watered down and tasteless .
the cafeteria type setting was also sub-par .
_num_ words ... greasy mess !
that i know of , there were no mistakes and nothing was forgotten .
unfortunately , i do n't know his name !
it 's not free refills fyi !
they start you off with chips and salsa .
mediocre .
nothing worth dying for .
the chicken taco and enchilada were ok.
my tostada was soggy .
the wait for our party was _num_ hour and some minutes .
like , i might throw up everything i ate .
ok i 'm done .
dishonest !
are you kidding me ?
maria told me what the price was and it almost doubled upon pick up .
after a good wait , we find out breakfast ends at 11am .
the place was clean , loud and lacked ambience and charm .
all of which i could live with , had the food been outstanding .
if you know me , you know i can eat .
there was no soul in this food .
my husband 's combo was as generic as they come .
every time i have gone there the service has been horrible .
poor service !
the chips and salsa were just okay .
the chips were a little stale and over salted .
i orders the tacos which i did not know were fried .
they were super greasy and the beef was very dry .
i feel like this was just a fluke experience .
not authentic in the least .
very disappointed in the quality of the food .
not to mention they offer hard tacos .
the wait is n't worth it unless you do n't know mexican food .
really disappointing customer service experience .
the answer was `` there 's nothing i can do about that . ''
not a good answer - not great customer service .
she did n't even say she would see if she could do anything .
by the way i have never written a review like this before .
had this for lunch one day before work - bad move .
the meal i got , though , was a disappointment .
this is where that salsa we discussed earlier comes in .
i ca n't comment on the beans , because i do n't eat them !
not good .
my other co-worker did not fare nearly as well .
wrong .
gross .
disappointing .
i was given a small bag of tortilla chips , and those were passable .
including a large fountain drink , i paid $ _num_ .
stopped by during a brief trip to the area .
took two bites and asked for our money back .
complained to staff and was offered something else which i declined but no refund .
meat tasted very bitter and left bad taste in my mouth .
it was truly horrible tasting .
go taco bell its better .
the chips were noticeably stale , but the salsa was good .
the carne asada tacos were gross .
the meat tasted spoiled , the texture was weird and it was greasy .
i was very hungry but could only stomach two bites .
the beans were runny and tasted bad .
i will not be back here again .
stopped at this place on the way to phx airport .
if i could give this place zero stars i would .
their meat was overcooked and flavorless .
even their tortillas were bad !
it should be illegal to sell food this bad !
gross .
i threw it away after _num_ bites .
even the tortilla was n't cooked all the way .
it was horrible and i wo n't ever be back .
if i could give this place no stars , i would .
i ordered _num_ chicken tacos and _num_ steak taco .
never once did i hear my number be called .
it was busy in there so i continued to wait .
after about _num_ min of waiting , i decided to go to the counter .
the lady then informed me that someone else took my food !
are you freaking kidding me ?
i only get half an hour for my lunch so i was furious !
there was no apologies from anyone .
i did n't even want the food by then .
by that point i was already over my _num_ minute lunch break .
i 'm sure it 's like every other taco shop on mcdowell .
the chips were very basic , and the salsa bored me .
are they hard shell or soft shell ?
why did they put lettuce and cheese on them ?
the shells were ok , but the meat was a poor attempt .
the shredded beef was mushy , no flavor .
chicken texture was ok , but no flavor .
mushy as hell , no flavor at all ... .
only chicken , carne asada or fish .
the meat was just okay nothing stands out .
do n't waste your time here .
there are way too many other options close by that are awesome .
sadly , the meat was really bad .
no taste and the pieces were way too big and full of stringy gristle .
chicken `` works '' giant burrito .
lots of beans but not enough chicken .
thus place is going down hill .
on top of that , the chicken did n't taste so good .
all the old employees have left and the prices have been raised .
the chicken is also tasteless and not grilled anymore .
on this visit i choose the grilled chicken and steak tacos .
however , i did not care for the chicken taco .
the chicken was somewhat dry and lacked flavor .
chicken tacos were not very good .
beef taco was ok.
veggie burrito was ok.
gigantic burrito was not very good .
probably wo n't be back again .
so sad !
ive been coming here for _num_ years and used to love this place .
my _num_ star review is now _num_ .
prices have gone up $ _num_ and portions sizes are going down .
they lost a long time loyal customer today .
unfortunately , i find the chicken pieces not too fresh and unbearable to eat .
this is probably one of the better places phoenix has to offer .
it is dry and flavorless .
sauce is flat and lacks flavor .
i ca n't believe this place gets so many good reviews .
we ordered california rolls , and found them small , dry and not flavorful .
much like grocery store packaged sushi .
the edamame was the worst i have ever had .
really , avoid these !
the crab puffs were nice though .
wanted a light lunch , so ordered a veggie rice bowl .
i chose to have the teriyaki chicken bowl as a replacement .
Neutral
and , i also hate leaving negative reviews .
that being said , i only tried the chicken teriyaki bowl .
the teriyaki sauce was so watered down it turned my rice into soup .
i was very disappointed with the quality of the chicken teriyaki bowl .
this was horrible !
not worth your time at all !
it just is n't good , not even close to good .
does anyone know a good pizza delivery place downtown phoenix ?
avoid the teriyaki chicken !
it 's really , really bad .
well , i did not know they would use arizona sand as the breading .
the chicken was so over cooked and bland that it dried my mouth .
the saving grace for blue fin are the portions and price point .
this is by far the worst record store i 've ever been in .
unless all you have is a tape player .
so i went to a late lunch with the moms this weekend .
and a crap salad . )
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i do n't want to listen to that crap ever .
_num_ .
the service is overall bad .
i did n't get the extra buffalo sauce i asked for .
my cup was empty most of the meal .
this place desperately wants to upscale .
they also do n't have facial tattoos .
but of course they were doughy and meh .
wings are skimpy and over-cooked to a tough , stringy texture .
when we arrived , we ordered a beer , and a soda .
i flagged one of the bartenders down .
me : `` excuse me ? ''
i tell him no , because i have left my card in the past .
you do n't treat me like shit and still get a tip .
yes , i am cut off .
i have had maybe three beers , and a shot , in _num_ hours .
horrible bar service ... all draft beers are out on a saturday !
not worth the stop .
the fish was bland .
the menu promised spicy sauce ... again bland .
i gave up on it after the first few bites .
it was n't worth the work and mess .
these sandwiches and two drinks cost us over $ _num_ .
however , the italian nachos were just plain disgusting .
for my meal , i ordered the bourbon steak flat bread wrap .
not just the worst service , but no service at all !
and this only after my girlfriend went to the bar and explain our situation .
i really wanted to like this place .
we ordered a sandwich that was piled high with turkey .
never mind , after _num_ minutes you 'll eat anything .
beer was overpriced at $ _num_ for a glass .
wo n't be back .
such a terrible experience .
the most pathetic looking chicken nacho came out first .
she ate hers i sent mine back .
my new burger came _num_ minutes later and was super greasy .
they screwed up my bill and took forever to fix .
you will be waiting forever for your food and it will be cold .
maybe you should get your facts straight before posting a reply .
there was no demanding there .
pass the word do n't go to this establishment .
she acted quickly , within _num_ minutes our food began to arrive .
they have _num_ items on the menu , most of which are fried .
_num_ minutes later , i finally got served .
granted , she was a bitch , but a bitch with a valid point .
are you kidding me ?
served the guests next to us and still did n't greet my group .
cant see it staying open too long .
actually , why do i care ?
the food is n't good enough , and the experience is n't good enough .
are you kidding me ?
the food ai n't that good .
the worst part ?
why do you make people wait outside when you are empty ?
one time i went there and only two tables were occupied .
they told us there would be a _num_ - _num_ minute wait .
i asked why there is a wait as nearly all the tables were open .
so there are n't enough waiters to handle three tables instead of two ?
despite the place being empty the mean lady told us to wait outside .
i said no thanks .
fate is my worst dining experience in arizona so far .
i wish i could say the same about fate .
unfortunately , that was n't so .
not good .
to put it simply , he thought it sucked .
ordered a chicken thing that was marginal .
and a beef ( leather ) thing with noodles .
the steamed rice was a `` _num_ '' for me .
this was no `` flo 's '' or `` changs '' .
the service did n't suck , but close .
i if you are in the neighborhood , you 've got ta stop by .
less flavorful and not as authentic .
the concept of making people wait even when the restaurant is empty is ridiculous .
i want to like fate but i just do n't .
they cater to my vegan cravings so how bad can it be ?
holy mother of chicken , christmas and rice .
the ambiance is cool but it does n't justify it .
sadly , fate falls apart in its execution .
he is barely a line cook .
wrong .
the food is horrible .
i really enjoy the atmosphere however the food is worse than a microwave dinner .
the food came finally and it was all crap we didnt even order !
`` she is on thin ice with the owner who is right there .
boo : it 's eight hundred degrees outside , and you know what ?
boo : no substitutions .
no sauce on the side .
i do not give a rat 's ass .
if i want a side of sauce , who the hell cares ?
i like it very very very thick , which fate 's was .
the tofu was good , though , crispy and not gooey .
sucked out loud , especially after we got our entrees .
the same server never came by twice .
no thank you .
this place is n't all that it 's hyped up to be .
i 've had better from , i 'm embarrassed to admit - pei wei .
i had the beef pad thai which was watery and bland .
it was just awful !
nothing special and the portion sizes leave much to be desired .
not so this last time .
the food was awful .
after having eaten here seven or more times , i wo n't be back .
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked ?
we walk and we walk and nothing .
may be this is some breakfast joint and i 'll get me some grits .
the sauce was soupy .
the noodles were not pad thai noodles .
it was n't bad and had a nice kick to it .
but there 's no way that 's pad thai .
this used to be on my very short list of `` favorite '' restaurants .
i am sad to see this place die out .
i really want to like this place .
unfortunately the service is terrible .
the food so , not so great .
)
they also have steaks and chicken dishes , but why bother ?
i am mexican ... and i know mexican food .
food here is greasy and old .
you ca n't get a bartender like her anywhere !
just wish the food was better !
can one give less that _num_ star ?
that fuzzy stuff is probably 10+ years of dust .
promptly served _num_ glasses of ice water and a menu .
chose bacon & eggs for $ _num_ .
overall , just o.k .
if they did the average rating would n't be _num_ stars .
so i really can not comment on how great it was .
but like sing high , the downtown nostalgia restaurants are extremely scary .
just avoid this ... it 's not good .
the salsa was tasty , but i would hardly add a star to it .
i could n't blame my add on it .
there was more staff standing around than patrons .
the seafood inside of the burrito was not really seafood at all .
the only saving grace on this boring tasteless plate was the refried beans .
soft and cheesy , the beans saved the day .
the bill was less than $ _num_ bucks .
they had some chips and salsa in the bar , but neither was good .
seriously the food is really bad .
how can a mexican restaurant get mexican food so wrong ?
should my beans be orange ?
i was served promptly and and my food came out quickly .
service was slow .
they did n't even offer sangria .
it 's hard to do mexican this bad , but they pulled it off .
i am from chicago where authentic mexican restaurants are abundant .
the rice & beans that came with were no better .
terrible service .
sat inside for ten minutes with no service .
moved outside and sat _num_ minutes with no service .
waiter was aware he had customers , just did n't care !
service was not good , they forgot about us after our dinner was served .
chips tasted stale .
no bueno on the green corn tamales and the service was terrible for lunch .
none of the veggies had been dressed or seasoned .
it 's really not that hard .
when i did eat there , the food really was n't that great .
usually a bite or two is good , then it just gets really gross .
the potato salad was the only thing that i actually thought was okay .
several _num_ or _num_ people groups at _num_ people tables .
strike one - wait staff should shepherd small groups to small tables .
our waitress finds us after a _num_ minute wait and takes our beer order .
another review said that the waitress had been on for _num_ hours .
i 'm not sure what everybody raves about .
i took it to go , which may have been my first problem .
ick !
ick # _num_ !
when all is said and done , yes , i 'm full .
the chicken was ok , a little dry , but edible .
the giant horse scared me !
i thought it was a real stuffed horse at first glance .
it was disgusting .
i 'm just not a fan of cold sausage .
i had a pita sandwich and it was just under $ _num_ .
walking in we were greeted by terrible music .
_num_ min later he says they are out of that to .
the server must have been embarrassed i would have been .
about _num_ minutes after we ordered we received our food .
the menu looks like it was written by a kid in the first grade .
also , it was written on one piece of white paper .
there were no descriptions of any of the food .
a bit slow .
they did n't know what was in the items .
the food was not good .
it was terrible .
the chicken was boiled and had no seasoning .
it was the worst shawarma i have ever had .
however , the potato salad was tasty .
for the price of the food , everything should have tasted better .
unless you go during happy hour , the prices do n't seem worth it .
ugh .
he was terrible .
and it was so loud we could barely hear each other .
sadly , it just wore us out .
one of the bowls they brought us was dirty too .
this is the worst chinese restaurant i have ever been to .
_num_ .
too expensive for a hole in the wall .
i ordered two entrees , fried rice , egg rolls and two beverages .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i did n't even have a single bite .
it was $ _num_ .
_num_ .
that killed my appetite .
also the place looked like a dump .
the ceiling looked like it had water damage .
the whole place was trashy looking .
i would give this _num_ stars if it were just her .
but her office staff gets _num_ stars .
bottom line do n't pee in the cup .
at & t is the worst wireless service i 've ever had .
this may be a record ; they lasted less than _num_ hrs for me !
giant mistake .
so i called customer service back , and they were closed .
i 'm going back to verizon and im never leaving again !
the phoenix light rail is a huge disappointment .
for me , paradise bakery is a poor man 's panera .
paradise bakery is disappointing in a few ways .
second , the caesar salad is horrible .
also the croutons are not very tasty either .
third , they completely use too much dressing on their salads .
bad food , worse service .
the waitress was hot , though .
it really should be _num_ stars .
the worst part is i can never eat another tamale again , ever .
but it was like pulling teeth to get more .
the chips and salsa are great , but everything else is pretty bland .
i am a fan of tamales and i would definitely not order it again .
the chicken was so dry and chewy .
i really do n't have much to say about this place .
i did n't hate it , but did n't love it .
and for the tortillas , there was none in the soup .
eh ... .
i was disgusted .
nothing too fancy or exciting .
went to the movie early saturday evening , but ate beforehand .
i know i would have gotten tastier food for the money .
i told the waitress and she said , `` oh , ok '' .
why did n't i check yelp first ?
i got this chicken parmesan type dish , only made mexican style .
anyways , i think the ideas here are good , just need better execution .
food was ok , but nothing i would go back for .
so this first experience started off with a huge cockroach in the bathroom .
almost could n't even sit down to go .
( yuck ) ok on to the rest .
the chips and salsa were good with a little bit of spice .
the only flavor at this restaurant was in the salsa .
it was so bland .
i was starving and could n't even finish it .
i 've definitely had better drinks and i 've definitely had worse .
the tortilla soup was really bad .
it tasted like a mix of chili powder and salt .
the chicken fajitas were actually ok , but not great .
overall , there are much better choices .
horrible and fake !
this is by far the worst mexican food that i have ever experienced .
salsa , canned , fake and simply unacceptable .
this is the point where i should have ran for the exit .
the rice , meh , but edible .
the asada or `` steak '' at this mexican restaurant , a saucy mess .
i 'll spare you all the rest of this mess of a meal .
one of the most disgusting restaurants i 've ever eaten at .
the place was bad news from the very beginning .
you could n't pay me to go back to this restaurant .
somewhat slow service and the food was only so-so .
so fake .
waitress did n't even ask how my food was .
because she knew it sucked .
for lunch _num_ taco with rice and beans $ _num_ .
regular menu _num_ tacos , rice and beans $ _num_ ?
nasty margarita and awful service .
came in on a thursday night before a movie and it was not good .
i 'm not sure , but no one wanted to help us .
the house margarita was so gross , could n't drink it .
i had the tortilla soup and the grilled chicken tacos .
not truly flavorful , nothing truly distinct .
probably not .
i walked _num_ feet to this place .
the worst disappointment was my main course - i ordered the red beef tamales .
these are the worst tamales that i remember eating .
and i am an awful cook !
she was prompt at with refilling our ice tea , but not hovering .
a mexican restaurant without con queso is crazy !
rice is too bland and the beans are ok .
but it 's not there yet .
i ordered the chicken deep fried tacos .
i really was n't impressed .
no flavor .
the tortilla was n't crispy enough .
not a good meat to veggie to tortilla ratio .
the food was not good .
once again , it was a chewy , mediocre seasoned piece of meat .
i 'm not a fan of mexican restaurants that have crappy salsa and chips .
sorry , it 's just a standard by which i live by .
the salsa was _num_ % water which is a bummer .
then we had a hard time finding our waiter .
the first time , i had a horribly rude waitress and slow service .
the food was mediocre .
the staff is ehh and not that friendly or fast .
felt that this was very generic .
i wo n't be going back .
the chips were very watery .
the server was courteous which is always a must for me .
as i 'm writing i 'm tasting the guacamole .
very bland !
the shrimp tacos are mediocre at best .
do n't eat here when it 's busy .
however , the service was really slow and poor overall .
do n't know how they kept it from falling through the grill .
today it was horrible .
this was the worst mexican restaurant i have ever .
the grilled shrimp that my wife ordered were tasteless and not grilled .
she threw up later that night .
who can mess up a burrito .
even taco bell can do a better job .
and the worst service ever .
do n't waste your time .
will not be going again .
do not do business with this company .
i would give the cabinets _num_ stars .
cons : poor customer service .
called after _num_ weeks , no call back ; called again .
waited another _num_ weeks without a call .
no calls .
i told them how disappointed i was in the lack of customer service .
... i was pissed !
what is it with everything closing sooo damn early in phoenix !
( ... i am from la ) .
avoid at all costs .
when you order something , you should n't get another .
i hate chicken and i got it anyway .
i did n't know until i got back to my conference .
anyway , it was n't even that good .
and it made me sick .
i do n't totally blame baja though .
baja unfortunately just fell out of my butt hours later .
fatty meat low quality with inflated prices .
... just go there instead .
their supposedly best hot wings are n't even close to being the best .
i 'm pissed .
also , why does it have to be _num_ degrees ?
i had to eat a cheese stick with each bite just to stomach it .
your tater tots were good and my blue moon was reasonably priced .
stay away from this hooters .
bad food , bad service .
not hot at all ) .
the wings are tiny and completely overcooked .
i do not recommend these at all .
friend # _num_ ordered the boneless wings , which are a joke .
however , friend # _num_ received the same thing this time .
i do not recommend these at all .
friend # _num_ ordered a dozen hot wings .
i do not recommend these at all .
overall , the worst restaurant in phoenix , i think .
oh , ps , they have never brought out our correct bill .
overpriced food with shady looking waitresses .
i thought i would try out this location , big mistake .
first parking is a nightmare .
i felt completely ignored for _num_ minutes , will never come back .
not the best hooters but definitely not the worst .
i love hooters wings , i wo n't be back to this hooters .
brittany , you are a terrible waitress .
my buddy goes , `` umm , can we get some service ?
i asked for ranch and never got it .
brittany came back and only asked to refill my friend 's drink .
she did n't take our order so of course she did n't know .
no one asked us this .
btw , those big tables were long gone by then .
it was actually pretty empty by then .
this is the very worst service that i have ever had .
my wings were n't even that great .
we were ok with that but it was not busy at all .
i left this location with a bad experience and hungry .
gross .
stopped here for a late night snack .
shortly , i was brought over _num_ sliders that were the size of meatballs .
yes , they brought me _num_ pieces of overcooked meat on buns .
my sandwich came with some curly fries that were horrible .
if it was n't for that , they would n't have gotten any .
umm ... it was clean .
wish i could select zero stars !
possibly the worse service ever .
i did n't even get to eat them at the restaurant .
worst of all no one apologized for the delay or for anything .
possibly the worse service ever .
should of been a zero star rating .
they have tables but really low seats and some tables with high stools .
never going to any hooters again .
_num_ ) flat ass everywhere .
i had it elsewhere in multiple states from hooters .
the food came out and the fish on appearance looked fried .
the lady stated that it was breaded and grilled .
did n't like the service or lack there of or the food .
not a service friendly place .
the absolute worst service i 've ever had in my life !
1st and only time i 've ever let a hooters place hungry .
i 'm extremely disappointed .
i 'm seriously feeling like i 've been cheated .
this was really disappointing .
this was n't okay .
a few of us local regular co-workers tried to eat at hooters for lunch .
bad management !
no one at front desk to sit us .
finally try to get a waitress .
they have crappy wings anyway .
Negative
if i could give it a negative _num_ i would .
we were starving and thirsty for a cold drink .
four confused people look over to a pretty empty bar area .
nothing was special .
would have been _num_ stars if not for our hostess experience .
walked in to have some quick appetizers before a movie .
we sat down no waitress came to ask for our drinks or introduce herself .
horrible customer service !
but she must have confused us for someone else .
have n't been back since , and never will go .
there has n't been a time where i have had a bad experience here .
cold , dull fries that had an old taste to them .
super soggy and just absolutely terrible .
it was as if they just battered them up with canned sauce .
no flavor , and not the amazing wings i usually get there .
Neutral
i read the negative reviews thinking this is not true .
honestly , i am extremely disappointed .
Negative
the negative reviews did n't lie .
all i have to say was food was very crappy !
wings are super hard and have no meat .
bad service , worse food .
i would not recommend this place .
do not get fish and chips , over fried on old oil .
i went to hooters after a meeting with some friends .
the chicken was awful on the salad .
i put my salad in the trash .
a short walk from the convention center .
they were n't too busy , so we were quickly seated outside .
food was pretty bad .
the chicken itself was mcdonald 's quality .
i know one typically does n't go to hooters for the food .
this place sucks .
there are so many empty tables .
the staff is really overwhelmed for no reason .
hostess said they are understaffed , not really my problem .
poor management is hooters problem and they need to fix it .
worst hooters i have ever been to and not consistent with the brand .
service was very slow , but the food though was good .
showed up with _num_ girlfriends for the last ufc fights .
walked in and sat at the table our friend was waiting .
will never go back to this hooters .
will not return anytime soon , was hoping to have a good day .
the manager juan was and idiot and said he was not seating anybody .
the waitress said any other manager would not do this .
need i say more juan was rude and seated people behind us .
why would anyone pay money for food like this ?
overcooked pasta , check .
look people , al dente and toss the alfredo on the noodle .
not my deal , though .
avoid at all costs .
i was amazed how much the food sucked at this place.
apparently the kitchen manager was on vacation and no one placed the supply order .
so not cool .
i remember when going to the spaghetti company was something to look forward to .
the salad was mostly dismal .
there are times when i wish i could go back .
unfortunately phoenix is slowly but surely returning to its roots .
surely it is not at the old spaghetti factory .
both times service has been horrible .
beyond the lousy service , the food is not good .
i really do n't like tomatoes in caesar salad .
second , our waiter brought it out with the other salads .
lastly the wine selection is pathetic .
for generic italian food , go to the olive garden .
i 'm not sure exactly what happened , but the food went way downhill !
the chicken parm that i got was pathetic to say the least .
once she showed up , it was n't completely horrible .
i used to have really fond memories of this place as a kid .
other than service , the food is doing little to impress me .
this gave me time to look around again for the first time .
ok so this is not fine dining i know that , i accept this .
what in gods name does that mean i have no idea ?
nor do i know why a cheese lover would love this dish .
clam chowder was the soup and salty was its name .
bruce looked over and said ; man that looks dry is it missing something ?
i am not sure what the fuss is about this place .
this added garlic , mushrooms and bacon .
the portions were smaller than i remembered .
rather than send it back i kept the salad .
i like to be checked on occasionally , but too much is annoying .
i did n't know my spaghetti came with sausage .
overall - $ _num_ for a hopefully soon forgettable dining experience .
probably the worst italian food i 've ever had !
how do you mess up italian food that bad ?
i 'll begin with the food .
the salad was _num_ and then entree was full price .
i did n't press the issue , paid the bill and off we go .
they were not busy at all for a saturday night .
the staff were friendly enough , but a little too casual .
the restaurant has lost its class .
it was very bland and way over priced for the portions served .
it was my 2nd time there and it was n't anything like i remembered .
all i ordered was the soup and salad lunch special .
just about everyone else was dissatisfied with their meals .
quality and service is terrible here .
there is way many better italian food restaurants in the valley .
this is a pretty lame review actually .
not sure .
fine , two reasons to hate it .
a joke of a salad .
the lasagna was loaded with meat and just enough ricotta to balance .
the color on everything that we were served was off and pale .
my pasta dish was spaghetti with a white clam sauce .
while the prices are good it 's not worth a less than average meal .
husband was equally disappointed with his chicken marsala .
chances of going back are slim to none .
our server was prompt and our drinks came quickly .
i had spaghetti with meat sauce and my wife and son had chicken parmesan .
we all felt the spaghetti was tasteless and the chicken was rubbery .
all in all a very disappointing meal .
the prices here a similar to most italian chain restaurants .
sorry but i actually have one of these restaurants in my town .
originally i wanted to give them _num_ stars but the food quality was bad .
i could n't justify an average rating for way below average italian .
my entree was really disappointing .
horrible service .
not as good as an olive garden .
again , horrible service !
i do not recommend .
disgusting !
the food was worse than fast food .
pasta was overcooked .
broccoli tasted old , like really old .
a place like this does n't deserve to take your money .
there was absolutely no effort put in the food or service .
having been there before , my friend knew she wanted the lasagna .
all entrees come with bread , soup or salad , and tea or coffee .
our waiter delivered the soup and salad , but forgot the dressing .
sadly , even their bread was n't all that flavorful .
`` , then i remembered he does n't work with chains .
i have been twice and both times both of our entrees were cold .
it was possibly the worst pasta dish i have ever had .
the chicken was so dry i could not eat it .
it tasted like it was either boiled , reheated or a little of both .
well it was _num_ dollar ... .
what a rip off .
first i ordered a diet coke that was watered down .
cheap .
flavorless and not worth the cost .
mine came back a mess .
the spaghetti was hard , not smooth tasting like they should be .
the marinara sauce on everything we ordered was bland .
the italian sausage i was afraid to even bite into .
when i did , it was cold and spit it right out .
either way no excuse to serve what they served .
i would have preferred burger king food over this place .
she was very overwhelmed with _num_ tables and i am unsure why .
my family of _num_ went for dinner on a saturday night .
the hostess staff was rude and had to get the manager involved .
food did not come out hot at all .
the food was also average nothing special about it .
i would not recommend this place and will not be coming back .
under _num_ is the max .
if this place were any faster , they would have drive through .
the guest are broke , or old .
they 're here for a cheap feeding .
your not gon na get 4-5 star food for what your paying for .
and - you should tip according to how much you ate .
horrible experience !
service was ok , nothing special .
the bread tasted weird and the actual food was just nasty .
crap from a can .
the drinks tasted like sewer water and the manager didnt care one bit .
the walls and ceiling were moldy and the service sucked .
the restaurant is less than half full ... we are quickly seated .
but not an appetizing smell .
it took _num_ minutes for our server to even greet the group .
several minutes later our server arrives with our salads , soups and drinks .
one of the worst dining experiences i 've ever had .
we ordered the lasagna with marinara sauce and manicotti with meat sauce .
the noodles were cooked perfectly and that 's where the praise stops .
it was only me and i felt like they did n't care .
the salad was soggy too .
needless to say i was invited for a group dinner and graciously obliged .
ugh .
people were standing by our entrance waiting for their table , poor design .
the waiter was n't very friendly , his service was very poor .
he would disappear for 10-15 between each action .
_num_ minutes till drink delivery .
drinks are delivered he disappeared again for another 10-15 minutes .
the food is mediocre at best , i can make it at home .
i got the chicken parmigiana with fettuccine alfredo .
the portion of food in comparison to the price , is small .
the food portions need to be increased by _num_ % .
took about _num_ minutes to get our drinks because our waiter was also bartender .
garlic bread and complementary bread were pretty good .
very hard to eat more than a couple bites .
chicken in my pasta was definitely frozen and looked like rubber .
i 'm glad i tried it but i wo n't come back .
do n't go here expecting a nice quiet lunch or dinner .
_num_ min wait on a tuesday with empty restaurant .
`` unfortunately we 're low on servers . ''
what this place lacks in quality , should be made up for in ease .
he came back and stated that they told him another _num_ minutes .
with that i thanked him for his time grabbed my family and walked out .
i met several friends for a birthday here , saturday night .
my check for _num_ was about $ _num_ including the added gratuity .
i probably wo n't go back to find out .
our server , michael was awesome .
no apology , no `` drinks are on us '' nothing .
totally lost my appetite !
uh really there is literally not one other patron in the place .
still no water .
still no water .
we then walked out and will not ever go there again .
went here to meet a friend for lunch .
did not like the food at all .
their pasta was very dry ( yes even with the sauce ) .
flavor was very disappointing .
so , i was sorely disappointed with the phoenix branch .
the food horrible i should have made my own .
food just was not that good .
my guy got the meatballs and spaghetti both dishes where nasty as hell .
this was our first and last experience at the old spaghetti factory .
our food was as miserable as the service .
it was the perfect unappetizing , terrible end to a generally terrible experience .
just gross .
not one person , not one , stopped to say anything !
_num_ thumbs down !
all in all very disappointed and we will not be back .
the only thing worse than the service is the food .
pure garbage .
wrong !
too bad , they missed the last time i 'll ever eat there .
my waitress was extremely rude and did n't know anything about the menu .
i could n't even get my water refilled .
he takes my card says sorry and charges me for everything .
do n't waste your time or you money going here .
the only good thing was the decor .
we made a reservation at 7pm ; did n't get helped until 8pm .
the hostess was terrible at her job .
now it just tastes so commercial not at all like it used too .
i 'm going to miss it the way it was .
why must you continually want to patronize boring chain restaurants .
lousy customer service .
if they say a _num_ minute wait .
talked to the hostess and they do n't care .
that makes no sense and is a very poor pricing model .
sad and pitiful really .
this was probably the single worst place we 've eaten .
do n't waste your time or money .
just left here , will not be back .
artichoke dip was all oil , no cheese .
when your meal for _num_ is _num_ dollars , i expect some etiquette .
no toilet paper .
the food was flavorless tasted liked the generic lasagna that you buy at walmart .
not good .
i went on a wednesday , during lunch , when school was in session .
they also had no coleslaw which is served on many sandwiches .
i paid $ _num_ for a bad sandwich and a drink .
i will not be going back .
my sandwich was n't terrible , just ok .
definately not worth $ _num_ !
i 've been there for breakfast and lunch and it 's ok .
i could n't eat it , it was not flavorful just a burning heat .
sandwiches are ok , nothing to really jump and down about .
terrible sandwich .
stale bread , dry sandwich , no flavor .
cashier was grumpy with a bad attitude .
food was once again , not terrible , but not what i ordered .
he got angry and slammed away when i asked him who he was .
i want tom 's to be better ... but it is n't .
wrong !
the worst part ?
they put a piece of individually wrapped cheese between two dry pieces of toast !
i went , that 's it , i 'm done .
the chicken was quite dry , it came with wild rice ( wtf ? )
f ?
that screams out `` filler '' .
there was pico de gallo which was n't too bad .
despite my beer being empty .
tonight was the last time .
and we did , it was tom 's restaurant and tavern .
it was a special event menu , which i really hate .
there were about _num_ vegetarian options , few of which seemed appetizing .
i was also really disappointed by the menu .
the food is great but the side salad was a disappointment .
finally the food came out and it was mediocre at best .
it tasted like cardboard and the roll it was on was hard .
it was served dry with tomato and lettuce if you wanted it .
however , the food and service are lacking .
i wish this place were better !
however , both were terrible .
my friends burger was also lackluster and flavorless .
for the price i would expect better food ... much better food .
honestly , they should get rid of the tables and add more beer taps .
quit the food , up the drinks .
the french dip was the worst of the _num_ .
the cuban pork was mediocre at best .
the blt - only okay at best .
the staff was very attentive , hostess was cheerful and welcomed us warmly .
$ _num_ for _num_ lunches and one soda - not worth it .
just like the rest of downtown phoenix , this place was dead .
the food was okay , but nothing to write to my yelp friends about .
and just a handful of stale chips .
# _num_ who puts jalapeno in spinach artichoke dip ?
it was so gross ... we sent it back .
then the worst ... the cheeseburger .
it was over cooked to the point of a leather consistency .
also , it was so bland .
she sucked .
needless to say we wo n't be visiting ever again .
keep in mind this is a bbq joint - with no bbq .
the service was horrible .
wilted to the point where i did n't want to touch it .
service was horrible .
we arrived shortly after opening on january _num_ , _num_ .
my wife is not a picky eater so this was to take note of .
what are the chances both our lunches were a fluke .
needless to say we were sorely disappointed after dropping $ _num_ .
this was the worst run bar i have ever been in my life .
bartenders did n't know what they were doing and were inefficient as hell .
it was super bowl weekend and they were understaffed so i get it .
but the whole situation was handled poorly .
really sets a bad example for phx events .
disappointed and wo n't be back .
i was sooo excited to find your place .
wtf kind of crap is that ?
i was not impressed with my meal .
i ca n't speak of the cobbler though .
the burger was dry and did n't have a great taste .
i received a only a handful of fries and my soda was mostly ice .
i went to get my refill and was charged $ _num_ !
maybe i 'll just skip the food and go to the cobbler next time .
the hours of operation seem just random for one .
how about not having sport peppers and serving it a stale crappy bun ?
i 'm just saying , it was a bit insulting .
they turned out to be a huge disappointment and we will not return .
stupid is as stupid does i guess .
so ... ... get your car washed at your own risk .
terrible car wash !
avoid at all cost !
worst car wash ever .
i get the same bs everytime i go .
i 'm not happy , and i 'm not going back either .
not sure i 'll be going back .
went to los olivos for the first time today to get my car washed .
-i paid for the complete works , but the vacuuming job was really shoddy .
i am going to have to vacuum it again myself later .
my very first review - my dark blue car ruined on the exterior .
rick was the gentleman from los olivos who accompanied me .
not acceptable .
this place has really gone down over the years .
i 'm only giving one star because i have too .
first time i purchased the $ _num_ basic wash .
however , when i got my car back i was not impressed at all .
my jeep was beyond dirty on the outside .
not so much on the inside but it could use a clean .
i was very disappointed in the work they did .
my seats were not vacuumed .
half of dash is wiped down the other half is not .
they gave me vanilla .
just little details that add to the horrible work they do .
i could have saved myself some money and time if i did do that .
i will never go to this place again .
do not go here .
first off , i asked them for a exterior detail .
i 'm not sure why i even tried giving this business another shot .
what a waste of time .
what the hell kind of business are you running ?
this is n't breaking bad , stop trying to do shady work .
do not , i repeat , do not visit this establishment .
this is ridiculous !
slow .
... slow .
so slow .
_num_ min and counting , i wo n't be returning i value my time .
not a day later and it was all over the side of the truck .
i will never go here nor would i refer anyone to go here .
literally slowest car wash ever both times i 've been here .
do not , i repeat , do not visit this establishment .
ridiculous wait times !
unfortunately i will not be back .
Negative
if i could do negative stars i would .
this is a place you should not go if you want a clean car .
what the hell kind of business are you running ?
thanks for taking my money and not cleaning my car .
they locked my keys in my car and left me to figure it out .
they were also hostile and blamed me for it .
they were so rude .
this is where i started kicking myself for not washing my own car .
my car ended up behind _num_ other cars .
no big deal i thought .
wrong .
a waste of _num_ dollars .
not even close .
my car sat outside and dried for _num_ minutes .
took them almost an hour to wash my car .
i was not told that .
she then told me there was a sign saying that .
there was n't .
yes , seriously - _num_ minutes !
the car wash itself is ok .
since the wait time is significant , i wish there were better seating options .
the second time i complained enough that they ran the car through again .
this used to be my favorite place .
i am so done ... the quality of work is horrible .
do you have an hour to wait for a $ _num_ car wash ?
the slowest , mediocre car wash in phoenix .
this is a $ _num_ car wash , at best .
slowest car wash ever .
this place definitely lacks good customer service and organization .
if i could give this place zero stars i would .
first off i have been coming here for a couple years .
my problem now ?
it did n't seem to be a problem the past couple years .
not me .
they will never see a dime from me ever .
they better miss me with that bullshit .
plus the ticket lady was very unprofessional .
but the outside had tons of water spots and was n't done very well .
why are they such jerks ?
total attitude from the time i walked in to paying the bill .
bread was cold and stale .
pastrami was nothing special .
do n't bother .
quality was okay and food is kind of bland .
just finished my first trip to the downtown deli .
for a lunch total of _num_ dollars for a sandwich fries and a drink .
so , so sad !
so no comment on the structure or service .
it is not horrible , but also not quite good either .
very uninspired in all foods i have tasted .
my only down note is on the service .
i seriously do n't know how this place rates a three star average .
just like many other reviewers , i really wanted to like this place .
this place is just ok in my book .
i went back and tried it again .
my fruit cup was sour , my sandwich was stale and just blah tasting .
we stopped in for lunch last week .
and my husband selected the greek chicken marinara .
thanks , but no thanks .
i 'm just glad we did n't pay $ _num_ for each slice !
it is a void .
the sandwiches were dry and not very good .
the food is just bad .
my chicken sandwich was dry .
i do n't know how this place stays in business .
the menu is so limited .
would you like chicken or chicken ?
chicken in a pita ?
chicken on some lettuce ?
chicken rolled in a tortilla ?
and the pita chips are bland !
and the potato salad has something in it that is way too tangy .
do n't get me wrong , i like feta ... but on everything ?
pretty colors and shiny things however do n't impress my palate .
instead , their food is bland .
the coupon gave me pretty much any menu item with a drink purchase .
i could have made it better for $ _num_ at home .
i really have no idea how they managed to make their food so bland .
i had the greek pita and there was nothing greek about it .
but ... i will visit _num_ more times for a total of _num_ .
_num_ strikes and you 're out is fair , right ?
and if you scratch the dressing , it 'll be healthy .
oh , and they did n't burn my sandwich alright .
it looked like it would be great !
flavors were good , nothing special .
( still i 'm strangely addicted to it ) .
you can go to paradise or subway for a whole lot less .
also , the restaurant is just dirty .
so gross !
my intention is not to get free stuff .
that being said , here is my update .
then he asks for my address so he can send me a gift certificate .
unnecessary , i tell him , but nice touch .
now , _num_ weeks later , nothing .
i was pretty excited to try this place .
i was disappointed .
my cole slaw was super soggy and loaded with mayo .
i asked for no mustard on my club pita and it had mustard .
the pita was hard around the edges .
it could have been just a rare bad day .
not bad , but not the best .
i 'm glad i took the workers suggestions because the pasta salad was amazing !
which is too bad because i love that they support local so much .
i ordered the steak kabobs with roasted vegetables and potatoes .
the vegetables were old , and the potatoes were soggy and flavorless .
the chicken tasted great , the greek salad it was served on was flavorful .
i am being kind with the _num_ star rating .
almost $ _num_ for a few cut up pieces of sub par fruit .
too much money for what was a terrible terrible terrible meal .
floor was a mess as were tables .
no real plates or silverware ... it was really kind of lame .
the branch was empty with the exception of a few employees .
horrible customer response .
i asked for a milkshake , not once but twice .
i got _num_ cups of ice cream .
slow service out of food when ordering had to pick other foods for lunch .
i would not recommend it to anyone .
i would n't recommend this place .
the met apartments are not energy efficient !
the fact is , these apartments are _num_ years old and need upgrades terribly !
this is the most understaffed subway in phx .
the problem with that is that i am usually trying to catch a movie .
it was not very busy .
worst subway in the history of the world .
their sandwiches really are n't all that healthy .
i did n't feel the holy spirit there at all .
good reasons to never listen to this terrible station again .
i wouldnt call this a salsa club .
it looked ok , i liked the outside patio ?
but i left outta there wanting to go to a real latin club .
i more than likely will not go back .
_num_ .
_num_ .
now maybe 3-4 .
if that station is not playing great music try _num_ .
now i can not stand to listen to it .
it 's sad how few options actually presented themselves .
so , we were led back to hard rock cafe .
we did n't feel like parking again .
but service unfortunately has been a regular issue .
the problem came when she had to leave to move her car .
that 's _num_ extra minutes with a toddler who was getting tired .
but unfortunately - i ca n't .
the food is average and the drinks are n't anything out of the ordinary .
a hard rock scottsdale would be way cooler .
we had overpriced salads and hamburgers that were large and filling and tasted decent .
while the service is usually ok , the food has always been mediocre .
today was the worst , though .
i did n't mind my overpriced drink that visit .
i do n't really know why .
the phoenix one is one of the worst i 've been to .
never great , never bad .
the shop is way too small and the merchandise is pretty lame .
turned around , went back in , and told the hostess .
buy a beer , walk around and see some dead guys ' guitars .
in fact , we should already be closed . ''
as a bartender , i 'd have insisted that it be so .
and there were about _num_ other people in there at the bar , too .
maybe it 's the corporate management bs that was in the way .
either way , they need to get it together on the hospitality tip .
last night 's dinner was no different .
as it turns out , service was what it usually is , slow .
meanwhile glasses sat empty on the table .
nothing special .
most of us had burgers and they were all just basic burgers .
i had the california burger and it was a big sloppy mess .
the fries were bland .
i went to the phoenix hard rock cafe for lunch on a friday .
and nothing i had was good .
for $ _num_ i got the worst plate of nachos i have ever had !
did not come completely mixed and barely pink .
i had a few bites of the sundae and it was even awful !
the entry is nothing eye catching or grand as it was then .
lame !
it is small and boring inside .
save your money and find somewhere else to dine .
seriously not worth the _num_ min wait and messy restroom either !
_num_ people walk in on a friday night .
seriously , i think she thought she was done for the night .
this hard rock is really nothing special .
overpriced and mediocre food at best .
who does n't want a hard rock cafe phoenix shirt ?
limited beer selection .
mediocre food .
not worth the wait .
it just felt kind of depressing .
ca n't remember the last time i was at a hard rock cafe .
he clearly could n't care less .
- the burger was dry , like it was previously frozen .
- the veggies on the side to put on the burger were n't crisp .
i usually like lettuce on my burger , but not their wilted lettuce .
- the music videos they play are awful .
while i 'm not a music expert , my guest is .
the mac n ' cheese was nothing special .
the service was beyond poor .
the food sucks .
when we got there , the table had not even been set up .
$ _num_ burgers that do n't look interesting ?
meat was a step above over cooked .
my fries tasted like it was fried in really old oil .
the manager was not willing to listen either .
a very bad experience .
terrible service on a saturday night !
oh and the food was bad all around .
_num_ stars for just the food .
i asked for a root beer and a burger with no onions .
for _num_ minutes .
horribly cooked burger .
bad layout of the main floor .
go to arrogant butcher .
the drinks were decent ... but nothing to make me stay there .
i will not ever step foot in the establishment again .
this is the absolute worst service that i have ever experienced .
at this rate , i 'm surprised they even have customers .
when she brought out our to go boxes , she did n't bring enough .
get your act together , hard rock !
we return to see the food taken away .
they cooked us a less then worthy steak to replace it .
i was completed disappointed .
our server was mediocre .
so weird they would n't allow .
a little annoying considered the $ _num_ price .
i got sick from the ribs ... no one was happy with their meal .
we all received _num_ cookies .
if it were possible i would have given this place a _num_ star rating .
everything from the service to the food was terrible .
worst experience ever .
slow .
bar tender is on speed and sucks .
everything else was a poor experience .
party of _num_ , one of their entrees was forgotten .
also , this place is way too small .
very crowded , making for an uncomfortable experience .
this place is ridiculous !
i have family visiting from out of town .
we did n't argue just ordered our food and quickly left .
she was rude , curt and generally unfriendly .
will not be returning .
and the manager was so rude to everyone .
the staff is rude and all standing around talking .
we got there at _num_ and was told an hour wait which was fine .
the only thing i could think is they were hoping shift changes ?
we got there at _num_ and was told an hour wait which was fine .
the only thing i could think is they were hoping shift changes ?
if you just need to fill your gut with something ... why not ?
i have tried the pizza several times and find it rather bland .
this is the short bus of all mcdonald 's .
four , and this is the worst .
are you freaking kidding me ?
this is fast food not your local coffee shop .
oh , wait .
unfortunately , out of _num_ visits they have only had the bagged ice once .
then i get someone who is rude and say 's yes .
the hash browns are gross .
it was a terrible experience in every possible way .
got ta remember not to return here ever !
bad service .
also i spotted a few homeless guys just outside sitting .
not only that , the place is n't all that neat .
however the bright spot is this smoking hot young mexican woman named kim .
do n't even bother coming here .
but unfortunately that did not happen .
why the hell are they getting paid $ _num_ an hour ?
total waste of time .
worst mcdonald 's i 've ever been to .
i 've tried multiple times and they just never have it .
they also quite frequently mess up our orders .
staff does n't seem to care .
rude !
i wish it were better because i live around the corner .
sonic down the street from now on .
just does n't scream exciting to me .
phoenix downtown is boring overall .
very nice facility , easy to get around .
i have never experienced a weeks worth of useless personnel .
( do n't eat at tortillas . )
although they advertise take out , there is no take out menu .
the atmosphere is stale and the service adequate .
my stomach was upset by the small amount i sampled .
i will not visit jordan 's again .
stay away from this place period , especially if you 're a veteran .
note : i will update my review if i need to go back .
eight business days later , i call back like wtf ?
so i said i need another doctor then .
my father was just to weak and sick to leave the home .
we ordered the full sized breakfast burritos with cheddar and black forest bacon .
$ _num_ for the burritos and _num_ bottled waters .
friendly service and clean but boring , bland ambiance .
nothing like the location at town and country .
try the breakfast club across the street .
been trying for _num_ mins on and off to order a delivery .
i get voice mail and nothing else .
i know prices go up , but that is ridiculous .
during a busy lunch rush you would imagine that sandwiches could be made quickly .
waiting 15-20 minutes is ridiculous .
plus $ _num_ for a half sandwich ?
very disappointed and will not be back .
no thanks .
disgusting .
i paid almost $ _num_ for my steak sandwich .
it did n't take that long to cook .
when i got my sandwich , it was a skinny little thing .
nothing compares to it !
but if your craving one , do n't come here .
business hours posted said they closed at 4pm on saturday 's .
the whole thing is incredibly bland and flavorless .
i 've been there _num_ times and it has n't failed yet .
i got the chicken tenders and they were awful .
they tasted like the chicken patties you get in a school lunch .
the french fries were soggy .
looked dead so did n't even try .
the arizona center is to phoenix as the galleria is to scottsdale .
there a a few restaurants still open , but barely .
never seen any of them even close to half full .
the lady at the phoenix visitors center highly suggested we check this place out .
needed a quick bite across the street after i landed at the sheraton .
in short , some interesting stores and restaurants all just thrown together .
this place was sooo empty !
the restaurants here are mediocre and somewhat boring .
everything else is sit down with waiter service .
too quote a famous movie `` iceberg ahead !
lame !
it 's pretty dead , with lots of empty shops .
lame !
wo n't be wasting our time here again .
no more , no more !
this is just sad .
absolutely wasted potential .
i blame the ridiculous payment required parking structure .
that 's a shame .
rude .
terrible , terrible service .
sloppy work - uneven filing , polish uneven .
impersonal and rude service .
will not go back .
the manager makes my nail technician leave me and do linda williams job .
i had to wait _num_ minutes until i got attention again .
because of the delay , i did not get good treatment .
the manager did n't even offer to comp my service .
i was so disappointed in this nail salon .
but it was not .
the lady doing my manicure was nice , at least she smiled .
do n't talk to me like i 'm twelve .
i am not one to write bad reviews .
then the finished product was crappy .
i would n't recommend this place to anyone .
this is the first time yelp reviews have let me down .
three days later the shellac cracked and began to peel .
i called the salon and they asked i return and have the shellac redone .
i did and the following day the shellac was cracking and peeling .
this was a waste of money and especially time !
i went to this place because it was close and the reviews were good .
update : after going here for over two years , i am done .
they do n't care for good customers .
disgusting !
at one point she actually yelled at me for having my hand too stiff .
and when i say yelled i mean yelled .
it was freaking horrible .
but she did not .
do not go to this place !
if i could give zero stars i would .
the ambiance is horrible .
very depressing .
i did n't like that because if it spilled my clothes would be ruined .
um i could do that at home if i wanted to do it myself .
i 'm here because i want someone else to do it .
at this point i was really annoyed .
the pedicure was painful .
the polish job looked like a _num_ year old did it .
no drying lamps .
horrible .
gross .
waited _num_ min and nothing .
customer service was poor and they were rude .
horrible customer service !
rose shot my fill straight to hell and did not pass go .
my acrylic after she finished was uneven and not even fully covering my nail .
i would n't even give _num_ star if i could .
this place is awful .
well , i should say the lady who did my nails is awful .
but the lady who did mine was just awful .
wrong .
she was rude .
and the old gel polish she did n't even get off all the way .
i do not recommend this place .
this was a horrible experience !
she was extremely rude .
next the salon is dirty and i felt super uncomfortable .
not relaxing at all .
then she charged me half of what i would normally pay for gel nails .
horrible , horrible experience .
there is a reason this salon was empty .
the shop was dirty but i was short on time so i sat down .
i wish that i would have looked at reviews first .
i would have never gone into their shop .
not good experience .
went in for a pedicure and was disappointed .
they did n't clean the utensils before using them on the next person .
and rushed through my pedicure and did n't do a good job .
i wo n't be back .
i do n't recommend .
worst nail place i 've ever been to .
rude dirty and the worst manicure pedicure i 've ever gotten .
they look horrible !
i would say that the sushi is mediocre at best .
on top of that , the prices are far too high .
you might as well buy some pre-made sushi from the grocery store .
the rolls are way too over priced .
_num_ dollars for a philly ?
the most i 'd pay for a philly here is _num_ .
i had take out yesterday and this place was just nearby my hotel .
it was _num_ bucks but for the quality , it should be 10-15 bucks .
you would probably need the drinks to mask the poor quality of the food .
the teriyaki chicken was ok , sauce too sweet and too much of it .
i should mention here that when we walked in it smelled fishy as well .
not a good sign for a sushi place .
it was ok nothing special and a bit overpriced for what you get .
i am not new to sushi .
i would never go back to this place .
the service was horrible .
the experience was very off .
i would n't return for sit down service but maybe take out .
but alas , two weeks after going here they are closed down .
_num_ visits in the last month .
both visits were n't good .
i 'm just not a fan period .
not impressed .
i ca n't recommend this place and would n't go back .
was excited to try it but it was a complete let down .
sushi rolls were terrible !
totally wasting money .
i tried this place for lunch because it 's located right across my work .
oh my lord , it was a disaster .
_num_ star for saying `` thank you .
i ordered the tempura dinner and was very disappointed .
received a salad that had old iceberg ( brown edges ) and no dressing .
had to ask for dressing , the cook apologized saying he forgot .
ok so we 're sitting here as i type this review .
the ordering process stinks , the staff seems totally clueless .
holy gross !
i have n't been to a place this awful in a while .
the customer service is awful just to start .
i paid but will never go back and never recommend .
i order sushi and the taste was n't fresh .
it really need more improvement comparing to my last experience .
very rude service .
poor choices of sides ( e.g .
i will never go in this restaurant again .
you can get better new york food elsewhere without the new york attitude .
i passed on the potato chips and drink , so he lost $ _num_ .
i paid with a credit card , so i obviously had money .
the salad was actually decent , but the sandwich was bad .
very little meat and cheese and way too much shredded lettuce .
even while taking my money he was being sarcastic and rude .
how she puts up with him ... i have no idea !
i can guarantee i will never spend my money here again .
oh i do n't know what the big deal is .
it was probably back in _num_ the first and only time i ate there .
i could n't even finish my bbq pork sandwich , i was that disappointed .
sorry , honey bears .
bland .
for shame !
ok , i 'll admit , phoenix has terrible bbq .
but this ai n't no relative rating , and phoenix needs some better bbq .
if you like a sorry excuse for bbq , this is it .
when you walk in , there is no aroma of bbq , just meat .
sides are completely forgettable .
i gave honey bears _num_ stars because the prices are good .
i ca n't give the sandwich a passing grade .
and for _num_ bucks , i want better .
if they get that right , i 'll throw another star at them .
the pork was very dry and obviously old as were the sides .
price was ok but who cares if your meal tastes bad .
people who enjoy good bbq should avoid this place .
sorry , honey bear 's , but i 'm not feeling you .
i just can not understand why this place is so highly rated .
but even that can not be true .
just not impressed at all .
i went honey bear 's with my wife to use a groupon .
the pork was dry with no smokey flavor .
the chicken was drenched in sauce hiding the flavor .
the sides of beans and corn were nothing special as well .
this place is still as bad as it was when i first reviewed it .
i got the ribs and two nasty side items that came with it .
( _num_ stars ) .
there were several on the day i was in ... ick !
overpriced and nothing special of this bbq chicken sandwich .
the one central is not good .
food was good but service was less than stellar .
about _num_ minutes went by and no food .
woman was out of it and did n't go pick up the food .
not impressed .
now , this was n't some big styrofoam container .
there was n't anything that screamed `` have seconds ! ''
overall , it was a _num_ because nothing blew me away .
despite the overall fair reviews i was pretty disappointed with this place .
)
but the big problem were the ribs .
but to be soggy , wet , fatty and without any real smoky flavor ?
come on , for what i spent what a terrible value !
also the men 's room was n't too clean either .
sorry but after _num_ strikes you 're out , will never go back .
maybe i 've flown too high .
i tried the mac and cheese as well as the cole slaw .
the pork was tough and had no smoke flavor whatsoever .
the cole slaw was ok , just bland .
it was n't even worth getting my money back .
the links had no taste except were very spicy .
the food sucks .
wow , we were not just disappointed , we were disgusted .
not a fan of this location .
ordered the pork sandwich and the bread was stale .
this place has dry .
and drowning it in their boring sauce does not help things .
very sad pulled pork sandwich .
my husband and i decided to try a new place tonight .
i could n't even pick it up , the bun was so soggy .
the bbq sauce was lacking in consistency and flavor .
the cheese in the mac was a bit thin .
there are better places to spend my money .
old and dirty room , and not good home flavor .
boy was i disappointed and embarrassed .
then , to top it all off , we were overcharged .
our original order came to _num_ the groupon was for _num_ .
waited _num_ hr for a beef sandwich .
all trash cans were full and stacked with plates .
sauce container was empty with plastic forks at the bottom that had fallen in .
the food was sloppy and they had a bunch of teenagers running the business .
i got my money refunded and walked out that was my final visit .
went to central ave location .
wo n't go back , waste of money , tables were dirty too .
the bbq is n't that amazing especially compared to other places in the valley .
seemed about average so naturally i prepared myself to not be impressed .
i see some obvious pride lost in the owners and employees alike .
i never like to see a business fail .
i had the bbq chicken sandwich and it was moist but not seasoned .
the cashier ruined my experience and management needs to check her attitude !
well _num_ goes by , ok i want a refund .
there would be a zero star here if i had the option .
never again honey bears will i treat you to my hard earned money .
dam i am mad .
this is just very bad bbq and poor service .
i have given it several chances and nothing has changed .
will not be going back .
my wife may go back but i never will !
no more .
not that crowded .
noticed most other customers were waiting too .
another _num_ minutes before # _num_ came out .
the cashier was dismissive - no explanation , no apology , nothing .
_num_ ( _num_ ! )
i usually stick to only good reviews but this weekend was the last straw .
this trip did n't make sense and they did n't really seem to care .
not really in a rush to go back ever at this point .
this was my first time to this place and probably the last !
well not here .
so the rude cashier looks over and says what .
go away we do n't want your money !
i 've tried their other food and its terrible .
the fried chicken and catfish had absolutely no flavor .
the bread is cold and soggy .
anything else and you 'll be really disappointed .
the sandwich was awful .
i ate the sandwich with a fork instead .
it came with _num_ sides an with tax was about $ _num_ .
the fries were ok so thats all he ate .
i liked the bbq sauce but the chicken was super dry .
the counter help was extremely rude .
this place has really lost it 's touch .
other than that i wo n't be back .
went there with my girlfriend for what i thought would be good bbq .
so it 's okay to serve bad food too ?
all he said was oh okay and walked away .
never would i think about going back and spend my money there again .
remember i did not place the order .
is n't it a given they would have my order written down ?
the worker was not rude but he was indifferent .
i just ca n't deal with bad service .
the drinks are watered down .
i knew from the previous _num_ times that i probably would not enjoy it .
hell even i came back knowing i would n't like it .
they also ran out of plates .
ridiculous .
i had _num_ bbq beef sandwiches because they were out of the pulled pork .
boiled meat covered in bbq sauce is not bbq .
i 'm really torn between _num_ and _num_ stars .
other than the employees , there were no other patrons .
my ribs were tough and the sauce seemed watered down .
overall , the food was not so good .
tolerable but not satisfying at all .
do n't get me wrong .
i did n't mind too much on how it looked .
probably have to roll up in a tank now , just to be safe .
unfortunately , we wo n't be back .
crappy bun .
a few pieces of pork tasted like paper had gotten into meat .
the mac and cheese was crap , and so not worth _num_ .
had i gotten there too early to be served yesterday 's reheated chicken ?
maybe built in _num_ and never remodeled .
the bun was a simply white bread roll , nothing special .
_num_ star for a successful pulled brisket sandwich .
i just was n't impressed .
every sandwich was on a ( fairly soggy ) standard grocery store hamburger bun .
it is n't so expensive that i would mind .
horrible customer service at this location .
it 's like they hate other black people .
angry looks and never a reply to a thank you .
customer service is always creepy .
i would warn african people and ppl of african decent not to eat here .
they do not cater to their own folks .
watery pulled pork , slaw had no flavor , and just yuck all around .
for over $ _num_ you expect something more than a soggy grocery store bun .
the cheap bun does n't support the sauce .
did the yelp check in coupon for $ _num_ off .
i guess i should 've read the reviews first .
a coworker and i went here for lunch about a week ago .
the fish had no flavor at all and it was way too crispy .
then i was told it would take another _num_ minutes .
it took over _num_ minutes before i got my food .
i threw half of it away .
big mistake .
moreover , they served me the very last serving of brisket .
the meat itself smelled horrible .
literally a faint odor of dog food .
the service was , umm , strange .
not friendly or unfriendly .
just uncomfortable .
we had eaten honey bears ribs frequently 10-15 years ago .
had n't been in such a long time .
the meat was flavorless .
the bottom bun was practically liquid .
really unpleasant .
my husband did n't want to eat his pork .
so disappointing ( and expensive ) .
i got the brisket , took _num_ bites and could n't stomach anymore .
worst bbq i every experience .
hot dogs .
i was traveling from los angeles , hoping for a good meal .
this place is garbage .
paid $ _num_ for a _num_ cent size cheeseburger from mcdonalds .
the meat was bland , tasteless .
i 'm not a big guy and the sandwich was gone in _num_ bites .
not filling at all .
tacky tables with bus stop ads in them .
bland food .
bbq sauce is nothing to write home about .
i 'm extremely disappointed that i wasted my money here .
not a fan .
i think the meats are boiled and not smoked .
everything was loose and chewy and over cooked to a mush .
do n't eat here .
we paid _num_ for lunch for two ; so not worth it .
the meat had no flavor whatsoever not even salt .
the only thing that was n't so bad were the fries .
i gave it one star because of the fries .
sub-par pulled pork sandwich .
no real bbq ( smokey ) taste .
the bun was pretty cheap and mushy after being soaked through .
bbq sauce was nothing special .
i wo n't be back .
prices are too high for standard fare .
it was terrible !
they did n't even have chicken available when we ate there .
( i realized this when i saw the bill next day ) .
forget it .
not worth it .
if i had stuck with that i might have had a very different experience .
the pumpkin bread pudding was good , but not worth making a trip for .
speaking of service , let 's not .
we got there at _num_ pm , the place was completely empty .
the beer was papago orange blossom ( which is glorious ! )
, and then screw over your customers , absolutely ridiculous .
you lost a long time customer and fan .
several of us went today for easter brunch - big disappointment .
the restaurant was not that busy - took _num_ minutes between courses being served .
the server never should have brought that plate to the table .
another friend had the bananas foster french toast - even the bananas were bland .
horrible customer service !
strangely rude and condescending .
it ruined our experience and vibe of the place .
poor service , poor choices .
disappointing to say the least .
we left confused by the entire experience .
when the plate came they were not on it .
this time a waste of time and money .
lights kept going out , iced tea never got refilled .
but this last time , it was not good at all .
not to mention that it was so loud we could n't hear each other .
all around disappointing .
( nothing like the wine we wanted that we 've had before ) .
worse , the food started to change in unpleasant ways .
just not worth the money .
the risotto it was served with was terrible .
it was hard and just not appealing .
the filet mignon was cooked well but not seasoned at all .
there 's just too many other options now to continue to be underwhelmed .
i wo n't be back .
yes , i do believe every restaurant deserves a second chance .
was not impressed at all .
the short rib was alright , nothing special at all .
the polenta was too thick and a bit cold .
they seem to be trying too hard to be something they are not .
will not be back .
and then never returned to take my order .
nothing special .
i was just at a wine dinner tonight .
$ _num_ for four courses and four wines .
went here for easter brunch .
paid way too much for a meal that left me feeling hungry .
it was like eating outside , except we were indoors .
my biggest complaint is that the food is n't that great .
it is _num_ star food with _num_ star prices .
there is no beer on tap and service takes a long time .
the atmosphere is not bad , pretty much expected for a wine bar .
the situation at the door just was n't handled very well .
that is not a caesar salad .
that is not bruschetta .
my companions ordered shared salad and flatbread which arrived without sharing plates .
i was embarrassed to have taken my visiting relative there .
i 'm rating this of my initial experience with this place and my disappointment .
the prickly pear margarita was very small .
az restaurant week inspired me to try a new place .
but our guy , uh ... not so much .
it appeared the az restaurant week menu was our only option for dinner .
i was disappointed in all our selections .
neither dish had much flavor .
overall , i was disappointed .
not my idea of a cool wine bar at all .
atmosphere was blah .
it had not ambiance no style , nothing going for it .
it was not cool to even be in there .
otherwise the place was not even worth wasting space in my brain to remember .
with that said - the port tasting was a disaster !
go not go there for tastings !
the pours were so uneven they ran out of port for several people !
obviously these people know nothing about wine pairings .
do not go to this restaurant !
my best tip is writing a review and simply not going back .
nothing worse than eating and freezing at the same time !
unfortunately , they are out of business .
looks like they closed their doors only a few days ago .
too bad .
sadly i 've never really had good food or drinks here .
they were cool for a week but that week has long passed .
in fact , its just pretty generic .
i find nothing appealing about this place .
but nothing to get myself worked up about .
or worse .
the bread and bacon were practically dripping in grease .
the food is bland .
the big unit -- bland .
nothing pops at this restaurant when it comes to the food .
that 's one disappointing appetizer .
the corn beef on my sandwich was tough .
it was dead inside .
it was the worst margarita i 've ever had .
surprisingly small size portion cut very thin .
the service was suck though .
not worth the drive from nor phx .
good food - but horrible service .
when we were , we ordered beer and wine .
our waiter dropped off my boyfriend 's beer .
it was not the one he ordered .
so , he ordered another beer .
when my food arrived , it had lettuce and tomato on it .
but , had i been that would have been an issue .
the only good thing about our experience .
there was two different color credit cards , not sure how this even happened .
we were very very very unhappy with our visit .
needless to say , good food - the worst service i have ever experienced .
dry fish , cheddar cheese and lemon ?
this place i had mixed feeling about .
all of my dish was served at a room temperature .
i went here with my friend for lunch .
it was n't organized at all .
then my friend ordered a beer on tap and that did n't work .
so she just ordered a bottle which was $ _num_ .
i was very disappointed and will not return here .
if you like crappy service and frozen , reheated food then go for it .
first thing the hours and parking situation are terrible .
finally had our chance and we were disappointed .
it was bad , i was expecting nathan 's !
as far as the toppings a+ , the baguette roll a+ .
our service was not any better .
our waitress noticed we had n't received anything yet and went to go check .
a little too late .
the food was nothing special but not the worst i 've had .
but , the food , that is another story .
drinks only ok !
_num_ words describes this place : tourist trap .
unless you are looking for drinks , save your money .
hot dog was flavorless and chilli was bland .
anyway , along comes the food .
the _num_ year old said `` what the heck is that ?
he did n't like it much and i do n't really blame him .
ah well , _num_ dollar sandwich down the drain .
the fries were just like burger king fries ... not so yummy .
each side is a dollar , by t he way .
way too salty .
we could n't even hear each other talking .
such a disappointment .
you can buy apparel , cups and more at the counter .
very loud .
the restrooms are not clean .
i know they 're busy but they 're neglected just like the tables .
service is bad .
after a while it gets annoying .
she said that she would have to charge us for another one .
it took us forever to get the next one and it was cold !
i was really disappointed at my experience here .
the big disappointment , though , was the food .
i got the bbq sampler thing and my husband got nachos .
now the not do good ... .
welcome to alice 's overpriced tourist trap nightmare !
food is expensive and totally tasteless .
the fish fry and fish tacos were the worst .
seriously , $ _num_ for _num_ skimpy , dry pieces of fried fish ?
the fries where some of the worst i have had !
dont fall for the trap like me !
this place sucks .
do n't go there unless you are very patient .
wednesday was _num_ % off their salads and meatloaf .
my salad was disgusting , to be frank .
not worth it .
go for a beer but not a meal .
well all i can tell you is shame on you .
firstly the food was horrible .
are you freaking kidding me.
what the hell kind of response is that ?
i would never ever let my restaurant get to that point .
it 's really not a bad place to watch a game .
with a few changes it could be a _num_ star joint .
horrible experience .
gross !
i ordered a turkey sandwich .
just awful .
do n't waste your time or money !
why bother ... ... the food is mediocre at best .
non attentive staff , very rude bartender .
left before getting waited on !
yucky i did n't think the food was very tasteful and it was overpriced .
the place was packed too .
you do n't have any bottles back there ?
- the restrooms are like gas station restrooms .
they could n't handle the crowd of people at the party .
- service is slow .
overall , not a good experience .
horrible !
avoid at all costs , unless you are a die hard alice cooper fan .
and if you are there as a fan do n't eat the food .
service is slow & totally apathetic .
it has a huge outdoor patio area , plus balcony , plus indoor seating .
unfortunately there were no grilled veggies in it !
it was filled about _num_ % with lettuce and raw , red onion .
too bad .
the food was nothing more than mediocre for the price .
place is pretty cool as far as decoration but the food was awful .
worst barbecue ever .
had the food been terrible , i would have gone zero .
that makes it really simple for everyone .
for a football event i went to , they were offering breakfast .
as for drinks , they really are just overpriced .
i know they have rent , i get it .
horrible pricing decision .
i would 've had an extra beer but this turned me off immediately .
nothing else to say , just too expensive for what you are getting !
atmosphere is ok , it could be so much better .
well , it sat on our table for _num_ hours after being finished .
so , service was bad .
i have made suggestions for other locations , and those suggestions stand .
wrong .
complete and total let down .
alice cooper , you should be ashamed .
there was basically zero wait staff .
there was no wait service - at all .
it is a shame the rest of the competition is being held there .
the kids deserve so much better .
the food was dry and the employees horrible !
the club sandwich was dry and lacked flavor .
she ignored us and talked over my husband to other people .
my buffalo chicken wrap was minus the buffalo !
my wrap was n't even hot .
had an order of _num_ chicken wings with the sauce on the side .
way too much batter on the wings .
however , the roll was extremely dry ( stale ? )
typical selection of beers and drinks .
i choose the fries and the nightmare chili .
it was an extremely disappointing dining experience .
i ate them and it filled my stomach .
the check was $ _num_ , and matt got no tip .
first time i actually checked in on yelp .
this is just a noisy sports bar .
but otherwise , meh , i 've experienced better .
went here while in phx on business with a friend who lives locally .
no such luck .
nothing seemed like real bbq just over cooked and tasteless .
they only give a small cup of bbq sauce for your meal .
huge disappointment !
what a waste of money !
second of all , the food was absolutely not worth the money .
we ordered their signature hot dog , the hamburger sliders and cheese fries .
it was disgusting .
needless to say , we will never return !
service is n't the best plus you have to pay $ _num_ to park .
very greasy and food tastes like it was not fresh and prepared and frozen .
bbq meat tasted old .
been there plenty of times before .
all visits alright , not exceptional though .
minutes passed , some people escorted her to the bathroom , brought her back .
obviously , i had lost my appetite .
what a shitty experience , i will never go there again .
it had a nice atmosphere , but the food left much to be desired .
when we sat down we waited _num_ minutes before waiter came by .
this time was worse then before .
we got _num_ slices of brisket and _num_ slices of turkey .
we sent it back and the food runner got pissed and gave us attitude .
but he did n't do anything until we complained .
so disappointed !
staying in tempe but made the short trip into phoenix specifically to go here .
mike , the bartender , waited on me .
not very friendly .
being a vegetarian , there are n't many choices for me on the menu .
nothing really stood out with my meal .
everything was pretty mediocre .
wo n't be back when visiting again .
it was n't happy hour and my draft bud light was $ _num_ .
i give this place _num_ star only because i like alice cooper .
rude , slow and unorganized hostess staff .
waited _num_ hrs and never served .
what a complete waste of time .
i have been here before and never have i experienced bad service .
no wait time , seated us fast .
waiter screwed up on my drink order but did correct it the 2nd time .
waited another _num_ minutes for her simple cheese crisp to come out .
sent the pulled pork back was cold when brought out .
so rude !
what did i miss to receive the crap service .
will i be back ... no !
the decor and wait staff are interesting and service was average .
i ordered a salad with grilled chicken .
i could have received a better salad at mcdonald 's .
the lettuce was wilted and looked straight out of a bag .
half the chicken was cold and half was warm .
bbq beans from a can , served in tiny plastic cups .
i did n't even get my food order !
so i had to wait another _num_ min !
looking around i feel sad for he people who eat this bbq .
in alice cooper i do not trust .
the waitress and/or kitchen got our order wrong .
really not anything special .
so it 's an ok place & glad i went .
i got no time for tears it 's just another touristy restaurant .
not much else to say about this place .
my thought was actually it does , because i was paying for them .
finally got a table and the waitress was awful .
food was cold , over priced for what we got .
wo n't be back .
the food was not good .
i really would n't recommend this place .
maybe get a beer but not the food .
love ac 's music but the food at his restaurant was awful .
the rest of the meats were serve cold .
if i 'm buying a premium drink it should be served in a glass .
only to be completely let down .
there was no merchandise to purchase , no glasses , no shirts , etc .
it was burnt and embarrassing to receive .
a little ghetto in areas .
the waitress was not attentive to our drinks .
unfortunately my experience was less than par .
very disappointing experience .
i had their green chili burrito , no flavor , do n't order it .
my husband and i shared the big unit and `` meh '' .
it 's not terribly flavorful , and the toppings are blah .
we came , we saw , we wo n't be back .
waste of time .
beer was n't cold .
now , it 's run down , dirty and the food tastes old .
looks like i went to the wrong place .
it was edible , but not enjoyable .
this place is not even mediocre .
actually i take that partially back , the chips and salsa were good .
i could n't even pick up a slice without it completely falling apart .
this one little thing would improve this place immensely .
quick and easy , not good and cheap .
talk about bad mexican food .
wo n't be going back .
after the game we stopped again , same thing .
pretty terrible all around .
food tasteless , salsa weak , margs weak and watery .
atmosphere very loud , ( game night ) and still only about half full .
only redeeming quality was patron shots .
would n't go back .
but tonight two really disappointing things happened .
we were told ) and only _num_ small bowls of chips for _num_ people .
very sad to think it was taken .
smell is horrible !
i was buying so i told him to get what ever he wanted .
service was first rate - amy is a rock star .
i would not order the two taco lunch again .
ok thats fine except there is nowhere to sit and the view is lame .
everything else is what you would expect from an older covered basketball stadium .
sorry phoenix this `` ai n't '' it .
ok i am biased .
i could hardly tell it was music let alone actually hear anything .
the sound was so bad that i feel they ripped me off .
had a terrible time .
however , the sound was ridiculously loud to the point of hurting your ears .
the security experience was horrible & piss poor to say the least .
first off the doors to the show did n't open until _num_ pm .
the lines were incredibly long .
it took _num_ minutes or longer to get into the building .
it could have been a very ugly scene outside .
absolutely ridiculous !
we had just walked from our car to the venue .
are you kidding me ?
they took them away and were rude and sarcastic the whole time .
a _num_ ounce water bottle .
i would make a fortune , i 'm sure .
not in phoenix .
very disappointed !
there were hardly any concessions to choose from for food and drinks .
for $ _num_ i could n't believe it .
worst ever .
cops and security have attitudes and are rude despite family event .
really ?
this is one of the worst run places i have ever been to .
_num_ lbs .
`` guest experience '' i will never ever go to this terrible place again .
this might be the worst venue to see a concert in the entire us .
acoustics are horrible just horrible and make listening to the music painful .
oh and you 'll pay $ _num_ for a beer .
the place has one big problem , the acoustics were terrible .
and it was $ _num_ for a soda .
do not stay here .
last fall my husband had a terrible experience with this hotel .
poor customer service !
even thought that was our last drink there , it still pissed us off .
epic failure !
the hostess was equally clueless .
the place was only a third full at most .
no reason for the extremely poor service .
ca n't wait until sliders opens for the season !
this tgi fridays is an epic failure !
worst customer service ever !
before sitting down we asked a waiter if the table was available .
)
when she brought me my check back the receipt with the survey was gone .
i asked where it went and she was n't sure .
horrible experience .
no one else is there , not their fault but still weird .
no reason the place is empty !
only reason this gets _num_ stars is it 's connected to the baseball stadium .
the place was not busy at all .
empty tables everywhere .
completely lame .
but horrible service .
the restaurant had no more than _num_ tables sat .
there was a ton of employees working and service was still slow .
then the manager finally came and sat us at a regular table .
literally had to tell her every aspect of her job , step by step .
we walked in , and the restaurant was completely empty .
we ordered , and _num_ minutes later our meals arrived .
i left a _num_ dollar tip and still feel that i was generous .
horrible !
not real busy inside .
waiter tried to sit us at a table that was in the sun .
his attitude was fairly arrogant .
way too many places downtown now where your patronage will be appreciated .
wrong .
the food was horrible .
fries were cold .
thumbs down .
do n't go here on a game day .
there 's no happy hour which is why we went .
thumbs down .
there 's no all you can appetizers cause of the game .
left paying over _num_ for sodas and _num_ meals .
thumbs down .
another _num_ minutes went by before he came back to take the order .
the waiter seemed apologetic afterwards but i do n't think i will be back .
do n't waste your money with this place .
very disappointing considering our bill was _num_ each times _num_ people .
very bad experience .
no big deal we did n't ask for it .
at this point we are more then ready to leave and never come back .
the chicken appetizer my wife ordered was barely warm .
needless to say - i was not happy !
the food was disappointing and the service was horrible .
and this experience makes me wish we had eaten the concession food ... .
saturday night game , no reservation .
first off , there is n't anywhere to wait .
there are no benches or chairs .
the hostesses and waiters were all under _num_ .
it was a mess , with zero organization .
fyi it is n't the full friday 's menu so some favorites are missing .
hopefully we have better luck next time .
oh and did i mention that there was no baseball game going on ?
i had hands down the worst experience i 've ever had at a restaurant .
from the bad service to the bad manners .
i 've been in multiple times and i was severely disappointed .
absolutely horrible service today .
i was left speechless .
a free desert did n't make this a better experience .
worst service ever !
ordered steak and waiter did n't ask how wanted it done .
while the food and atmosphere were great , our waiter was anything but .
from the minute we were seated matt , was awful and rude .
we had _num_ people in our party , and _num_ orders were wrong .
pay attention people or get off yelp .
a lot left to be desired .
i had the bourbon chicken , meh !
came on the side , in a little dish , i mean little .
the sweet potato fries ... limp and not crispy .
this is not a mom and pop shop that closes when its slow .
this double standard makes me never want to go there again .
their are other options , like hard rock cafe .
terrible experience .
it was terrible .
Neutral
the next negative i want to bring up is the full menu .
i ordered the california club sandwich , it was disgusting .
needless to say , two bites and i was done .
sad to say i will never go back or suggest to anyone .
this place could be really great , but unfortunately as of now it sucks .
do not do business with these liars and thieves . )
i was just sent to the start of the _num_ menu again .
she comes off rude and she is a bitch !
worst customer service ever !
welcome to impersonal banking at its lowest .
very unprofessional and rude employees .
this is not sour grapes because of that .
they did n't have one of those bartenders .
they had apps too , that ranged from $ _num_ to $ _num_ .
overall , we do not recommend this establishment .
refused late checkout though the hotel did not seem busy at all .
no hot water .
the carpet was old looking and coffee left something to be desired .
i would n't stay here again .
horrible hotel !
my room was dirty .
i had low expectations of the hotel , which turned out to be accurate .
flat screen tv with standard cable channels .
no fan in the bathroom .
toilet leaked water onto floor .
very loud air conditioning unit .
hallway noise could be heard in the room .
curtains did not fully block out street light .
breakfast selection limited compared to most hotels .
the worst hotel i 've stayed in , in my entire life .
the new room had its own new problems and new stains .
i was forced to stick it out for the remaining of my business trip .
again , this was my experience with quality inn and suites .
so dallas g and i were thinking of a lunch spot .
feta or no feta ?
it has little cheese and is not flaky .
the gyro meat tastes like ... nothing .
anyway , the restaurant pretty much blew .
is he gon na hate it ?
your last name is greek .
well , that was stupid .
i hate giving two star reviews to family owned restaurants .
not because of the taste .
`` it 's not offensive . ''
_num_ % completely underwhelming .
i did n't want to rate it _num_ ( meh .
they get packed for lunch and have lots of chicago shit on the walls .
the quality was crap and it was $ _num_ .
- awful gyro meat .
- the sauce was mediocre .
it 's homemade , but that does n't mean it has to be mediocre .
- fries are n't anything special .
maybe too fast since they gave me so little meat .
my husband and i ate here after i purchased a groupon .
while the food was not bad , i definitely will not return .
this place was n't bad , but it also was n't good .
i 'm just not sure what else there is to be said .
weak .
little out of the way , but way better and you wont leave hungry .
save your time & money and go elsewhere .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the exhibits in this museum are severely lacking in the second half .
`` this is how a house is built .
anyway i feel this place needs more exhibits for adults to enjoy .
disappointing .
the few unique exhibits were very underwhelming .
the race exhibit seemed like a huge waste of space .
the digital world might have been interesting in _num_ .
big miss on their part and more than a few irritated people .
man , the science center has gone downhill !
first of all , this place is expensive !
how much more boring can an exhibit be ?
i thought that was lame .
it was interesting but i was a little disappointed .
i was bored .
this was god awful .
this was totally lost .
this exhibit was not worth the $ _num_ in my opinion .
you can not give zero stars on yelp but zero is the reality .
this is a review only for our student field trip booking experience .
warning -- - do n't do it .
there is absolutely no excuse for this .
most disappoint museum experience ever .
i 've never been to a museum where they had only three exhibits .
besides that the information presented was short and not in depth .
in short i would n't waste my money here .
so they did n't fail completely .
so why only two stars ?
parking was confusing .
there was also a special exhibit that would have been $ _num_ additional dollars .
holy crap !
the employees were n't very friendly .
so not worth paying for , glad i did n't .
the layout of the place is confusing .
nothing really makes sense in the layout .
way too expensive .
in the first place , it was supposed to be a free event .
our ears ringing , we wandered around visiting the exhibits .
some did n't work at all .
the heartbeat drum was cute , i guess .
this place has gone down hill .
totally boring , i am glad my trip there was free .
after two hours , we were done .
there , we would visit a dozen times per year .
i think that this museum just feels tired and limited .
too bad .
which seems huge but not really considering the size of phoenix .
just overall blah : ( sadly disappointed and i will definitely not be returning .
could n't get near the exhibits .
really poor sound control .
so glad i wasted $ _num_ on the groupon .
( what finish would you chose for your bathroom ?
why does any child care about that ? )
and any additional attractions are more money .
such a ripoff .
went early and could not see the displays .
such a disappointment .
never had a more unpleasant time with my kids than today .
did n't like it .
it 's a shame it only caters to children .
and even then it 's not that great for what they charge .
skip it .
in fact , the experience as a whole is not worth the money .
for two student tickets and two special exhibits , i paid nearly $ _num_ .
past that age , and they would be bored .
if i could give _num_ stars , i would .
turns out the feature was n't playing .
they should really change the name of this place to the arizona kids place .
went to renew membership and left happy i did n't .
oddly enough two employees were feet from where he fell .
ppl like michelle work at the az science center .
i 'm assuming michelle just does n't like kids .
i would not recommend this company .
my car became disabled in my garage .
called this towing company on the recommendation from my car dealer .
ugh .
does n't anybody give good customer service anymore ?
valley towing company was the worst company i ever have .
however , the next service took almost two hours for them to arrived .
but as we knew , their services were super slow .
i would not recommend this company to do the towing .
this is the worst experience i 've ever had with a tow company .
shady business practices all around .
because that is what all reputable operations do , run on a cash basis .
my dr 's ma , was loud and obnoxious !
he had the worst bedside manner i have ever seen !
he did not want to hear any of my symptoms .
we ordered online + _num_ star .
the website said that it would take _num_ minutes - _num_ star .
they have blue cheese + _num_ star .
they were breaded and had something sweet and sticky on it - _num_ star .
then he had the nerve to ask me if we still wanted it .
_num_ stars .
pizza is inconsistent .
_num_ out of _num_ times it 's anything but !
an apology would have been more appreciated then a sarcastic comment !
i do n't recommend going to this pizza hut .
the service is worse then the neighborhood it sits in .
Negative
i wish there was a negative star i could rate this place .
this was such a rip off .
i ordered two medium sized pizza with thin crust .
now , image that being cooked with toppings and passed off as pizza !
he had a complete lack of empathy or customer service at all .
manager is totally incompetent and has no idea how to use a computer !
( i just threw up in my mouth a bit . )
i 'll bet that is the real reason jared lost all that weight .
not happy subway .
and get your teeth cleaned !
that yucky yellow stuff is called tartar and it can be removed .
they 're better off just not saying it all if it is not sincere .
i have been to this subway at 16th st and thomas many times .
their hours posted on their door even say they should have been open .
the first time it happened i just blew it off .
it 's sad that where i live there 's a _num_ year waiting list .
sad , especially for the children that really need the program .
this hospital is way worse than banner desert in mesa .
instead of treating your patients better , just fill them up with more pills .
is your stomach hurting ?
for people with insurance , such as myself , it was a horrific experience .
the care we received was substandard .
it 's not like she brought a diamond ring and left it lying around .
we would not come back here or encourage people to come here .
there are hospitals that provide better service in our opinion .
_num_ .
_num_ .
( _num_ ) resident physicians were not a positive experience .
we did n't feel comfortable in their care .
would have preferred not to have dealt with residents .
( _num_ ) billing office was difficult .
instead of going home that morning , we did n't leave until _num_ pm .
_num_ .
_num_ .
no `` excuse me '' or anything !
not cool .
i was literally in so much pain that i could n't even sit down .
i 'm not kidding .
these people do n't care about anyone especially the elderly .
overall many doctors and nurses were helpful in the care of my mom .
they have everyone in this one room waiting for hours .
it 's not sanitary and the staff is very rude .
if i can give this hospital zero stars i would .
horrible !
now i know why physician groups do not link themselves to facilities .
i would never get care here .
the quality of care is very poor .
worst experience ever !
first baby having their in _num_ and i almost die !
i was n't sure of what to do about it .
by far the worst hospital i have ever been to in my life .
avoid this hospital at all costs !
doctors are exceptional , nurses are ok , the hospital itself is unacceptable .
rooms were small , uncomfortable and unbelievably dirty .
i was given a blanket that smell very badly .
again poor communication and rude staff were present there .
wo n't recommend .
actually i would not encourage anyone to go here .
that seems so biased and very misleading !
i did n't even recognize any of the former employees .
i 'm sure you will leave disappointed .
two thumbs down to this lemon !
boy , was i sorry .
gross , i know , but so was this meat .
after eating there once , i doubt that i will ever go again .
the meat was ok but the taco itself was very greasy .
my husband ordered two enchiladas , one machaca and one chicken .
the one thing about the reviews that was correct : service is not great .
we are white , and the others getting better service are hispanic .
it was so disgusting i could n't even eat it .
skip this joint !
disappointing .
on a friday night at 7:30 , it was less than half full .
our waitress was one of the most surly servers i 've ever had anywhere .
no greeting , no smile , no eye contact .
they just do n't give a damn .
very odd and not really nice at all .
no complaints at all .
there are not many vegetarian options , which is normally ok for me .
i 'm not difficult to please .
i was surprised how mediocre it was .
even the margarita just was n't that flavorful .
horrible experience .
the food was oily and the service sucked .
food is still great but the service was terrible !
we were very disappointed .
i tried this place for the first time for the raved about menudo .
not spectacular , but it satisfied my pregnancy craving for menudo .
the only set back was that it took forever to get the menudo .
that and the service was not good .
the server barely came around or not at all to check on us .
you get what you pay for , which is not much here .
have had better and also worse .
but check your bill before paying .
that does n't sit well in my book .
i also ran into the slow refill issue that others mention .
the experience started out lousy .
the food sucked and the service was substandard , i will not return .
tried this place and it was the worst food ever .
the food is horrible !
last night we tried the shrimp fajitas and were very disappointed !
no sizzling hot skillet here !
just a bland cold plate with tiny shrimps , some not cleaned .
chips and salsa were really good , but beware the chips cost $ _num_ .
the rice was super bland and had no flavor .
the salsa was weird .
even the chips was bland !
annoying .
maybe dine-in would be a better way to experience rosita 's .
once seated , it took forever to get service .
took another _num_ minutes after that just to get the bill !
when i got home , i fed the leftovers to the chickens !
after this , i was never going back !
i told him it would be a mistake ... it was !
again , hard to get service .
there are about _num_ tables and _num_ waitresses !
server was the reason why i did n't do a one star .
food was very mediocre .
hashbrowns came out with no color and soggy .
sent them back , they came back with no color and soggy .
asked for chorizo with fried eggs , but got it all scrambled .
not busy btw .
tamales were old and tough as leather .
ok , if i could do two and half stars i would .
service was slow .
disappointed .
i could sense she wanted no part of my family 's need .
the service was bad .
the waitress had a bad attitude .
i do n't know what was her problem , but she was unpleasant .
also , the waitress got our order wrong on my friend 's dish .
the waitress was also difficult to find .
they charge for chips and sauce on top of the burrito .
it was different , but it did n't taste good .
i wo n't be going back .
the reason why is because their service is terrible .
people around us were sitting down , eating , then leaving .
took to yelp to help us out and we were sadly let down .
let me just say , i 'm not cheap ( swear ! )
i just hate getting ripped off .
dumb .
we left both our meals on the table and will not be back .
thanks yelpers , following advice of others is not always good .
the horchata was decent but that was the only positive about this meal unfortunately .
how hard is it to screw up a taco ?
and sell hungry but will opt out of yelp for dinner tonight .
_num_ stars .
the absolute worst bar in town , let alone the worst gay bar .
_num_ toilets in the ladies room , last nite one was broke .
this place by far is the worst bar i 've ever been to !
they are all rude !
you can not have fun at this place because they will kick you out !
the service is always horrible , the dj sucks and the people are rude .
this guy is awful .
i went to him for _num_ visits over months .
he told me nothing was wrong with me .
i never asked for pain medication yet was treated poorly .
this man cares nothing about your pain .
he -- does not -- care about the patients whatsoever .
appalling conditions .
the showers and bathrooms are completely disgusting .
i would have rather relieved myself outdoors .
they run the place more like a business rather than a care facility .
it was painful to see .
the food is also disgusting .
the only thing that did n't taste gross was the fruit and the drinks .
even the oatmeal is gross .
he was arrogant as well and spoke down to every patient .
i will never ever go back to this horrible place .
do n't even say that in-n-out is better .
the first time , they gave me a whole grilled jalapeno .
they got the onions , cheese , and bacon right though .
the people working here are very friendly if not a little disconnected .
i ordered a whataburger with cheese and onion rings and a small drink .
but as it is onions lettuce and tomatoes are falling all over the place .
the meat was dry and lacking an particular flavour .
the onion rings were very generic and sort of soggy .
i tired it and that is enough .
if i could , i would not even give the food _num_ star .
food !
after one bit of my grilled chicken sandwich , i instantly regretted going here .
it was disgusting .
amongst the worst fast food burgers .
what in the world is that crap you call a bun ?
easily the worst bun on earth .
whataburger is n't .
it 's far , far , far worse than that .
gross .
still awful .
how the heck could anybody like this place ?
_num_ stars because it is n't mcdonalds , although mcdonalds has better buns .
slow as hell .
i 'd rather give my money to another business .
wondering if it was made last dinner rush .
the drive thru is _num_ minutes for each car that 's in it .
i was really excited to finally try whataburger .
more like what a disappointment .
maybe it was just too hyped .
i made an appointment for _num_ pm on a friday for my friend .
it did n't look like she was too far into it either .
crap .
_num_ minutes later she is back to my friend .
then from out of nowhere the stylists son starts going off the handle .
evil happens .
_num_ minutes later , the other stylist had to finally take over .
actually , there would have been no _num_ minutes !
we left _num_ hours later .
then hit you with a $ _num_ fee without hesitation .
take the good with the bad .
it was disgusting .
my salsa was watery and it had one huge tomato chunk it .
the chips were stale .
so why only two star ?
parking was very limited due to the construction .
the window in my room looked into the backyard of someone 's home .
manager comped us the room , but i slept badly and was horrified !
one star is far more than they deserve .
the owner ruined the entire experience .
the part where this goes bad is the management .
rude managers combined with a shabby hotel in a sketchy neighborhood .
i would n't stay here again if you paid me .
this time it was not .
when we got to our room my wife found dead roaches in the bathroom .
did n't give me a refund since i booked through expedia .
i would rather drive the _num_ miles home instead of sleeping in this place .
no roaches there .
my advice to phoenix visitors , avoid this place .
my veggie burrito was almost $ _num_ and not very appetizing .
a co-worker was very disappointed also .
it seemed like a bunch of toppings thrown together with chips and ranch dressing .
we also use this place to cater meal for our late working employees .
the catered food was a lot better than my burrito .
seems more often than not , something is missing from my combination dinners .
it 's too bad .
friendly staff too !
it 's not that great .
it was dry and it tasted like paper .
very off .
actually , nothing it the burro was the least bit warm .
but again , i was starving at this point so i took it down .
i knew immediately that something was wrong .
big mistake .
i consider myself to have an iron gut , too .
not cool .
i really do n't think i 'll be back .
but our burritos were not great .
what is so hard about having the whole thing heated through ?
i do n't understand why people eat here .
i am from mexico , and even the street restaurants are better than this .
the red sauce has sooo much flour in it you could taste it .
suffice it to say i was offended and promptly cancelled the order .
and the toast they served tasted just like the greasy grill , terrible .
it was all really inedible as was the menudo that my girlfriend ordered .
disgusting .
also people are in there at 10am drinking large beers , very weird place .
i am sure it sucks though and i will never go back .
not good .
i can get pass the decor if the food was good .
no flavor unless you add the sauce ( a lot ) !
from my experience tonight , the rumors may be true .
not so here .
i got the shredded chicken and the carnitas tacos .
soft corn tortillas , of course .
no flavor on either - i guess they really rely on their salsa bar .
i was never called back , emailed , nothing .
they were like nasty over-cooked spaghetti in a watery , flavorless sauce .
even with soy sauce added , they did nothing for me .
i 'm kind of sad b/c the other reviews on yelp seemed pretty good .
i had a few bites and lost my appetite .
my boyfriends meal ( forget what he got ) was no better .
i wo n't be going back .
still _num_ out of the _num_ dishes we ordered is n't a good record .
but whatever i order seems boring and uninspired .
i was disappointed that it was just white rice with bits of egg .
and the rice still tasted more steamed than fried .
anyway , i was glad last year that they fixed up the decor .
i have not been back since .
not impressed whatsoever .
everything here tasted a little off , and it was very expensive .
as for the main dishes , they lack taste .
nothing was good , i 'm sad to report .
my husband ordered the bell pepper chicken , which was just ok .
not a fan .
had the sesame chicken lunch combo and did not like it at all .
the chicken was hard and the sauce was n't good .
it was just not a good experience .
the chicken egg roll was very greasy .
my main dish was the cashew chicken .
the flavor was bland , so i decided to add chili paste .
it was hot , but tasteless .
gross , gross , gross .
with several pathetic pieces of onions .
thats mongolian beef for the ghetto house of hong kong .
this is not chinese food .
my third timing coming .
i will not be back .
food is unfortunately mediocre not what we thought .
i ordered the shrimp lo mein with lobster sauce .
mmm , sounds yummy but the ramen noodles just blew it for me .
for crying out loud , ramen ?
the restaurant was set up kinda weird .
the place could use a little updating and tlc .
downright horrendous .
just tasted like a ton of vinegar without any quality or flavor .
well , this hot and sour soup was disgusting .
worst customer service ever .
the tables were dirty and breaking apart the chairs were filthy .
do n't bother with this place .
i want to see my doctor in a white coat .
i hate doctors who have a business in addition to their practice .
people die in surgery centers .
i was exhausted , had been out of work for several weeks .
was facing back surgery and trying to find a surgeon .
maybe that was true , but he would not be doing this on me .
no problem , just schedule me for another appointment .
not so fast .
no problem , can i pay it when i show for the next appointment ?
it 's $ _num_ people .
this place has really gone downhill in the last few years .
they do not return phone calls or emails .
this is a disgrace .
cook sitting on the counter dirty .
flies on the lip of the water pitcher dirty .
i 'm giving welcome diner _num_ star for the service .
the food was pretty good but the experience just ruined everything else .
why let that ruin my lunch ?
disgusting .
the burger was dry and not tasty .
the food was good ( not great ) but the ambiance was totally unacceptable .
they had a dj playing music at an obnoxious volume .
if i were a neighbor we would have a real problem .
as it is , i will most definitely not be a return customer .
what a disappointment .
they took way too long to make a grilled cheese sandwich .
not only was the grilled cheese hot , it was also extremely small .
pathetic .
do n't waste your time .
not my favorite , but fries are fries .
it was dropping and the bun got instantly soggy .
we will not be back .
they do n't believe in customer service at the welcome diner .
this place is a hell hole .
do n't really see what all of the buzz is about .
the only issue i had is their food is not that good i felt .
like everyone said the wait time for your food is truly ridiculous .
would i be back ?
really good looking menu but the execution really failed .
with one window taking all of the orders , it was painfully slow .
our food did n't arrive for another _num_ minutes .
yes , an hour and forty total .
brutal .
my burger was good but the fries were awful .
poorly done .
service was non-existent so we were ignored .
_num_ dollar whiskey and soda the whiskey and sour ended up being _num_ dollars .
total should have been _num_ bucks .
will not frequent this location again .
you ca n't pay me to come back there .
drinking , drinking , drinking .
there is zero energy .
no talking .
no laughing .
was i expecting too much ?
it was the most depressing experience .
this is clearly where strippers go to die .
the place was surprisingly active for a wednesday afternoon .
like , where the hell did they come from ?
i dont think i 'd ever get a dance here .
this is the worst strip club i have ever been to .
nothing , and i mean nothing is as bad as this club .
the girls here are downright disgusting .
Neutral
it would be negative one if it were an option .
even the overpriced bourbon street would be a better bet than this .
on name alone we had to check this place out , just for kicks .
one , quite simply because he was bored and someone paid for it .
it was time to leave ... quickly .
save the time and trouble and go elsewhere .
!
blonde bartender cutest of bunch to bad she did n't dance .
yes , this place is hood .
it is a random thursday , and have waited an hour now .
if they were n't so good in every other regard i would change doctors .
if my friend raved so much about them then how bad could they be ?
completely unbelievable !
she told me she would check into it and call me back .
total cost _num_ .
day of surgery they had two male assistance that flew in from cali .
total and epic fail .
shame on me i guess .
they had not left a message so i was curious and called back .
i was informed a doctor would call me back.
i am very very disappointed with the lack of care , consideration .
i wouldnt consider this a horrible place .
four hours pass and no call .
the nurse called back and was horribly rude and condescending .
nine days pass and no call .
it 's now been two weeks , southwest has never called about my records .
i do n't know why nobody at southwest could do this for me .
i will not return and would not recommend to anyone .
from early on i was not impressed with the front desk clerks .
she is certainly not in the correct profession .
they saw me april _num_ , _num_ .
this visit was nothing more than q & a .
needless to say they wanted me to test every _num_ hours .
because the bleeding was so light , i believed her and went home .
i lost it .
tears would not stop .
i was given two completely different answers which made me not trust these people .
it was pretty gross .
for $ _num_ , i could 've gotten much better mexican food somewhere else .
the foods are not the same as they used to be .
the service we had was terrible when we went for breakfast one morning .
i wonder if they are having trouble with thier managers .
what a horrible horrible place .
i had _num_ of weed in my car .
since they have the power to refuse service to their customers , be careful !
the general staff are completely incompetent and unhelpful .
so , the plan was to drop off the car after work on friday .
well , i am glad i did that because it is definately not .
it is not a dentist office !
are you kidding me ?
do not get your car fixed here !
zero stars indeed !
used this company through my appliance warranty .
but again , it was repaired and it was repaired properly .
not at all true .
bad reviews here and other sites are well earned .
proceeded to charge me the $ _num_ service charge and left .
i called american ice machines , they send out a technician the same day .
all of their service contacts are horrible .
do n't deal with these people if you have a choice .
tech was not interested at all about the install .
upon leaving he left all the boxes and packing materials in the kitchen .
big avoid !
ii would not recommend this place for active or any military member currently serving .
first , i dropped off my dress blues uniform on a wednesday afternoon .
the employee working there stated the uniform would be ready the following thursday .
hearing this i left my uniform there .
i was pissed .
now the store is empty and i am the only customer both times .
obviously he is unhappy and does not pay attention to details .
for those of u that take your uniforms there you have been warned .
there was no help for them in any way .
they would rather lose a customer than make things right .
first of all you have to leave your purse at the counter .
i am not comfortable doing that anywhere .
the only place i have ever seen this before was asu 's bookstore .
then you walk in this warehouse that has no air conditioning !
no sorry .
so i am lost of what to say .
did not live up to the hype .
i do not let it out of my sight , ever .
the prices were maybe $ _num_ below retail stores at the most .
if you live _num_ minutes away , sure .
_num_ % of the stock was stuffed toys and dog clothing .
this place did n't want our business .
i wo n't go back .
i have to down vote this business for a terrible customer service experience .
no dice , he told me that i had to go .
this time _num_ cans were defective .
yes its my fault for not checking this prior to hitting confirm button !
cons : abysmal customer service .
terrible .
inventory control needs some help .
then you might be screwed .
is ridiculous !
it 's been _num_ days !
the repair service is terrible .
it broke off after them using to sheer _num_ lamb !
`` the repair man that fixed them did not do it right .
by taking too much of the outside covering off .
i will not be recommending this place to anyone ever .
first my shipping error , now this .
the owner of this company was a completely greedy business owner .
it 's sad because i thought they were a good , honest company .
do n't order from here , you might get screwed in the end .
i really hate giving bad reviews , but the seafood was terrible here .
cost was too expensive .
the salsa was just ok .
very disappointing .
ordered the fish n shrimp tacos and i was pretty disappointed !
not much flavor in the shrimp or fish .
the salsa did help but overall they were weak tacos .
i 'd rather stick to rubio 's for tacos .
i did n't order anything else so this rating is just based off tacos .
i called their _num_ number , got the call center in phoenix , az .
i knew i was wasting my time at this point .
they went back and made it as i stood there for about ten minutes .
nothing to make me want to return .
two stars for poor customer service .
it 's none of your business and quite rude .
this rainbow led to disappointment .
not very sweet which i imagine some people enjoy , but not me !
the not so sweet donuts with icing all tasted the same !
zero flavor !
sorry to tell ya my fellow yelpers !
unfortunately , the owner was rude and indifferent .
no hello , no how are you , no welcome .
how incredibly pathetic .
i just had the worst experience at red .
how can a store possibly survive if you are treated so poorly .
not here .
it felt more like an overpriced museum .
i 'll never waste my time there again .
never getting out of their seats at any point of our visit .
whatever .
i was so excited to check out this store .
when i received my bill it was for $ _num_ .
i am very upset that i was billed almost twice what they quoted me .
worst clinic i have every experienced .
they are too big and give patients false hope .
do n't rely on them scheduling you correctly .
very very disappointing .
this group is one of the worst i have seen .
everytime i would go they had someone new .
the following morning i had emergency surgery to save my son .
thankfully i am _num_ weeks post surgery and now _num_ weeks pregnant .
the chips and salsa were decent but nothing special .
the cabbage slaw accompaniment was of no help in adding flavor .
overall a very disappointing experience .
we complained to the waitress but nothing was done .
the service was not the best either .
current phoenix sales tax is _num_ % and we were being charged _num_ % .
they comped my food , which was n't necessary , but they insisted .
my taco and tostada were just alright .
the beans in the tostada were cold , which i am not used to .
we 've had everything better somewhere else , and feel no need to return .
what a disappointment !
first off , i thought the service was mediocre to poor .
no water , no extra chips for the table of four , nothing .
my wife tried the huevos rancheros , which were okay , not terrific .
i had the two enchiladas and shredded taco plate , about $ _num_ .
gut bomb was more like it .
my daughter had two shredded beef tacos for $ _num_ , filling .
i live downtown , so only about _num_ min from here .
i wo n't be back .
the meal was n't terrible , but easily forgettable .
nothing `` special '' at all about any of the items .
meat in all the dishes was tender but not very flavorful .
all in all , a disappointing lunch .
the breakfast burrito was particularly boring .
i think i could have made a better one myself .
stopped in here for lunch on our first day in phoenix .
ice cold corona 's at $ _num_ a pop .
the sign on the door says they close at _num_ pm .
this was extremely disappointing since we had driven from glendale to eat there .
wo n't be coming here again .
chips and salsa were n't anything special , kind of tasted bland .
the front office staff is so beyond unprofessional and incompetent it blows my mind .
the chairs did n't break when we sat on them .
, and what edible food there was was simply average .
this place always runs out of items on the menu .
it was bad enough she did n't check up on her guest often enough .
never smiles .
avoid the water .
but this one is always short staffed .
and there does n't seem to be much management around to smooth things out .
do n't know that i 'll venture in again for quite some time .
i was there for a late lunch ( 2:30 ) .
she was not providing service to other customers .
come on , people , fix up the place - okay ?
there was literally trash and food all over .
not one person asked us why we were leaving or anything .
we just walked out .
however , our biggest problem was the service .
she cleaned off a table and sat us .
some time had passed and we were all out of water with no service .
he gave me a dirty look and went into the back .
_num_ mins later our waitress comes back and finally asks if we need anything .
also , this terrible service was from the night shift staff .
never going back !
this is a _num_ star at best .
the prices is not $ should be $ $ .
i 've gone to better restaurants with a smaller bill and more food .
the food was around the mill nothing special and nothing terrible .
horrible horrible horrible service !
was n't even busy today !
no more .
the prescriptions are not filled when promised .
they lost one that took me forever to get .
horrible place .
tomato soup with basil , good flavour but to course in texture .
much too sugary with no other flavour .
burger was good , sandwich was very mediocre .
for the money and the food , we probably would n't go back .
around the same time we ordered a bottle of wine .
they were also very misleading with their sides and salads .
overall , a pretty uncomfortable and disappointing experience .
something is wrong here .
unfortunately , the food does n't make its marks .
the building itself is adorable .
maybe used to be an old house ?
from a very snobby waitress , i was immediately put off .
nothing was bad .
nothing was stellar .
for $ _num_ , i ca n't say i was thrilled .
very quiet , like empty quiet .
but we wo n't be back for dinner .
when i called , i thought i was lucky to have reached the owner .
i said , `` some are ; some are n't . ''
she said , `` i do n't think this is a place for you .
two thumbs down ; two thumbs way down .
food is where it goes downhill .
we got the crab cakes which were only mediocre .
the ones i make are better and they do n't cost $ _num_ .
my husband got the surf and turf and it was not good .
my excitement did not last long .
chefs can have an off day and food can turn , i get it .
just weird .
this place is all hype and nothing memorable .
burgers and hot dogs were not a or even b quality .
wait , nope .
hot dogs = terrible .
too thin and no flavor .
two attempts to get the food we ordered .
not a smooth running process .
but they keep getting the orders wrong !
shame !
if i could put zero stars on this review i would .
no french fries ?
carrot and raisin salad on the menu ?
really this place was gross .
they need to just scrub the place down .
the meat was tough , and could not be eaten .
how can you make a gross blt !
everything else sucked .
if you want to eat diner food without getting sick , go somewhere else .
and yes , i tried this place a couple times wanting to like it .
and no fries ?
dry , flavorless , terrible .
well , i had been warned and ca n't exactly complain .
problem _num_ : very dry chicken .
how hard is it to make a chicken sandwich taste good ?
musty is chic now ? )
_num_ in phoenix is like _num_ in boston .
the food on the other hand is horrible !
i got a ruben sandwich , it was pretty dull and flavorless .
i also got a side hawaiian salad , which was also flavorless .
burgers , hot dogs and cold sandwiches .
wrong ice cream , wrong topping .
but it took so long to get that i just ate it .
unfortunately i was very disappointed with the quality of the food .
it looked equally disgusting .
this was my third time and probably last .
the service was terrible .
no particular server assigned so therefore no one to check on us .
even though this is an ice cream shop i would n't take your kids .
i wo n't be back again .
the food is absolutely dreadful .
however , i thought i would give it a chance .
big mistake .
why _num_ star ?
it was dreadful .
they are not even trying to make it good .
can not comment on food as we only tried the shakes .
meaning the shake had no flavor .
but wo n't return for the food or shakes .
first impression : bad .
service : terrible .
the wait staff was young and in need of training .
then two mistakes still were made with the order including an incorrect entree served .
dude , just write it down !
as we walked in we were told to seat ourselves .
we just shrugged it off & ordered .
i was so embarrassed that i picked this place !
you 'd think with those prices the service would be much better .
i was severely disappointed .
the food was terrible and completely overpriced .
the service was not good .
the icecream was something you could buy at the grocery store .
do not waste your time here .
bought a groupon and used # _num_ of _num_ .
not sure i will go back to use the other _num_ .
the food was not good at all .
ordered a cheeseburger , potato salad another bacon cheeseburger and hawaiian coleslaw .
the cheeseburgers were frozen patties and cooked clean into next week .
waitress was not friendly either .
no french fries !
potato salad , chips , coleslaw , carrot raisin salad .
my pastrami and swiss on marble rye was pretty burnt and fairly bland .
the potato salad hardly had any flavor .
pretty dissatisfied with this place , will not be returning .
food was mediocre at best .
however , the hard boiled egg was food service .
no bacon , which almost always comes in a chef 's salad .
meats were the cheapest of the cheap .
the small print on the coupon stated after _num_ pm .
i missed the fine print , but the server did n't .
this is a very short window .
she also had a side of potato salad it was very bland .
probably wo n't be back unless we have a visitor that wants to go .
the problems i had was the food had little to no flavor .
we went twice and tried different things with the same level of disappointment .
the chicken sandwich was on the second visit was just as bad .
the potato salad they raved about was even more bland .
no french fries , just bags of chips .
the place really needs a good cleaning before i will go back again .
the only reason to check this place out is for its historic value .
if you decide to trying this place out ... have zero expectations .
stopped on on my lunch break which was during their rush .
after another _num_ minutes i asked the waitress if i should come another time .
sincerely disappointed .
the store its self is retro , but dirty retro .
this was disappointing .
i think overall , i will try another place before i came back here .
i had a great visit here .
i had a craving for ice cream so tried this .
great idea , but cleanliness is not a thing here at all !
i have no picture to add because the waitress did n't let us stay .
and the menu is n't online .
you hardly know it 's a restaurant because of all the antiques .
a little too dusty for my liking .
the food is what we went for but i was disappointed .
there are some sides offered like potato salad for example which was tasty .
i had the `` bird '' , which was a turkey burger .
first off it is a frozen tasteless pre-made patty .
i hate that taste .
nothing worse than freezer burnt meat .
do n't order the turkey burger because you will be disappointed .
very flat .
and it was definitely not worth the _num_ buck price tag !
we wo n't be going back .
ok , i 'm all for dive bars .
the pee smell was just too much .
i do n't get it , it was n't a very good burrito .
i have to say i was a bit disappointed .
shame on them for no chips and salsa !
the green chili has gone down hill you can tell they are cutting corners .
worst mexican disaster to hit planet mid town .
sloppy burrito fold gooey cheese processed beans .
the restaurant has no place to sit indoors .
they have limited hours .
no way !
it 's slow , pricey , and the food is just average .
the menu is confusing and the cashier did n't really explain things well either .
i gave it _num_ stars for lack of process .
over rated !
very reasonably priced .
orders ... .
wrong !
chicken was dried out , and hard .
i went to ranch market !
i hate it that there is only one door to enter and exit .
they also only usually have one register open or _num_ max .
but there are several checkout lanes .
they sure do n't know how to do business .
broken dates of service always has a excuse .
broken dates of service always has a excuse .
no recognition from staff that this is an issue .
this is a _num_ minute job to do !
do n't use this location .
he did n't know left or right or north , south , east west .
`` oh , no problem .
do n't do business with this place !
no wonder the warranty was only for a year .
the room was ok , but the ac was absolutely scary .
the other thing i had problem with was their free wifi .
in my opinion , the facility is probably way too old .
i would not stay here again if i ever go back to phoenix .
i 'm paying $ _num_ a night on the weekdays .
worst hotel ever for this `` level . ''
we get to our room and the key does n't work .
the front desk gave us the wrong room key .
it actually opened another room .
gross overall .
underwhelming - attention to detail is lacking .
i did not have a good experience here .
the bathroom looked very worn , the shower and sink leaked .
very noisy .
i visit phoenix frequently and this is my first stay at this location .
the hotel is marginal , but needs some major updates .
the last _num_ mornings i arrived to find nothing but crumbs left for eggs .
worst front desk staff ever .
sufficient .
the pool and hot tub have a very , very rough bottom .
the room was barely sufficient .
_num_ mushy queen beds , a couch and _num_ tvs .
not sure if this is new , but its cash only .
it was a friday night , maybe we 'll try again on a weekday .
at _num_ pm , we were handed large menus with several dozen interesting choices .
that 's not an attempt at humor .
we both got ceviche apps , which were pretty good .
not sure ) .
not return .
the mariachi band was so loud it actually hurt my ears .
i was excited to try this place based on all the positive reviews .
unfortunately , this is just bad seafood , not matter the type .
i ordered the seafood ceviche and it was not fresh at all .
i 'm not from here and was looking or some authentic mexican food .
service was slow .
margarita was weak .
the sea bass was gross .
the staff was super nice about it and the owner did n't charge me .
bad dream .
unfortunately , the food was only okay .
wo n't repeat as my disappointment will not go away any time soon .
im only giving _num_ star because i ca n't give _num_ stars .
way overpriced for the amount of seafood you get .
do n't think i 'll be going back to this spot .
they did n't taste fresh either .
i do n't get all these 4-5 star reviews .
the only thing good there was the waitress , who was attentive .
disappointed .
i will not be visiting this restaurant again any time soon .
good food but terrible waitresses .
it ruined my entire meal with the family .
the wait for the food was long as well .
the location is not very big and feels crowded inside .
there are no baby changing stations in the restroom .
the place is very small feels very crowded especially with the band .
Neutral
terrible servers .
as soon as we got our food they brought out the bill .
watered down shrimp cocktail , and al pastor tacos that were really not flavorful .
horrible service .
i waited _num_ min before getting drinks even though there is couple of tables .
food very mediocre and service was very slow .
as for the food the chips and salsa were on point .
but the beans and rice were terrible .
do not buy a vehicle from these people .
i do not see how they have stayed in business for so many years .
again do not buy a car from them because you will be sorry .
horrible place to do business !
my girlfriend and i bought a car here in may .
`` if it is broke , just ignore it .
it 's not our problem when it leaves the lot '' .
dropped it at a local shop to see what is wrong .
over $ _num_ to get it fixed .
total rip off kind of people !
not trustworthy !
i ca n't imagine doing this to people every day .
ate two bites and moved on .
overall not a good experience .
he is so cold and the office is like a zoo .
the doctors are way too busy to provide any real patient care .
i came home , shut the alarm off and went back to work .
at this point about _num_ % of the work was done .
i would never try to deal with this company again .
he told me he would call me back in _num_ minutes with the info .
do not get a car loan from this company .
my husband is a disabled veteran and they do n't care .
worst customer service ever !
sorry to be harsh but now i really appreciate the botanical gardens in california .
i agree with ian below as well .
it 's too bad .
but for me it was too much so .
poor customer service .
there were signs at the entry pointing wedding guests where they should go .
garden scheduled to work until _num_ pm .
they should let people know before selling tickets to them .
i just do n't get it .
the hype around this place is ridiculous .
what the desert botanical garden has is desert .
the desert botanical garden is just desert .
and i 'll go for a hike .
i second the other reviewer that does n't `` get '' this park .
nope , i have n't missed anything .
second visit was as underwhelming .
what a complete waste of money .
unfortunately more than half the areas were closed due to private parties .
they should decide whether they are gardens or a wedding venue .
!
sooo not worth it !
if that 's the case i feel sorry for phoenix !
it happened to someone else in my group so it was n't just me .
unfortunately , you 're gon na have to wait for it .
service is slow , and not always friendly .
i 've been there many times , and this is the case every .
otherwise , i 'd rather give my money to people with manners .
walked in and everyone looked up at me and then looked right back down .
could n't get anyone to answer my questions or even acknowledge me .
seems the non jeweler has the place figured out .
and said how `` much more advanced '' she was than that .
anyway , i needed something specific so i tried to get past it .
their prices were not very good either and their service was terrible .
appalling service .
it 's the `` who can we blame game '' when something goes wrong .
if you wanted to be treated rudely , this is the place .
really , google the items you want & order them somewhere else .
they are rude , slow , and rush you out at closing .
unfortunately , i had my two kids with me .
i am not that kind of parent .
she was just rude .
because of their bad attitude and rudeness .
i walked out !
mario is an accommodating , polite , gentleman who appreciates your business .
i quickly paid and left .
i went into this store yesterday buying all supplies needed to make jewelry .
left a very bad taste in my mouth i will not be returning there .
the store itself is filthy .
this is completely unacceptable .
my suggestion to everyone ; avoid the store until they get their act together .
this is not a cool place ... and the booking is god awful .
in fact , i do n't think i 've ever seen anyone in there .
it 's usually empty when i drive by or stop in .
there is n't much room to move , and it 's poorly lit .
the bar was shut down , and my $ _num_ cover went to waste .
i likely wo n't be back .
agree with the other two in regards to this subway .
not here .
i had the tuna today and it was gross .
very disappointing .
two words .
they leave ash trays everywhere for anyone to smoke .
it was disgusting !
when i went to complain the woman at the front desk did not care .
she then gave me a look with attitude and i walked out .
the in room dining is mediocre at best .
i 'm glad i 'm only here two nights .
the only good thing about this place was the cookie when i checked in .
it was all downhill from there .
it 's not .
that 's ridiculous !
i can not recommend this hotel .
the hotel and warn and very out dated .
the carpet in the guest rooms is disgusting .
it 's just too much trouble i guess ?
the place feels like an old run down days inn .
there are two positives .
a little disappointed in this hilton property .
not the best hilton property i stayed at .
find another hilton in phoenix if you can .
needs a major remodel and cleaning job !
come on , hilton , get your act together !
the lady at the desk is like _num_ years old .
my family and i checked into the room just fine .
once we got up to the room , i gave the kids a bath .
the water did not heat up well and was more on the cold side .
when i went to take a shower the water was not hot .
i should have asked for a discount off the price for the inconvenience .
i will not be staying with the hilton again .
i did not plan to get in as it was too cold .
unfortunately this room was dated , dirty and noisy !
popcorn ceiling , stains in tub and on curtains , carpet that looked dirty .
( there was a high school band staying at the hotel ) .
there 's no standards and no new construction .
it 's a crap shoot .
i would have much higher expectations for $ _num_ .
no a/c that works .
glad we left , never again !
it is by far the worst service i have ever received in this city .
it was too sour for my taste buds .
after _num_ or _num_ minutes , our appetizers came .
two thumbs down .
this should n't have been their best dish .
i could have cooked better fish .
my chicken was dry and the shrimp did n't have any flavor to them .
applebee 's fajitas was definitely better and that 's not saying much .
the total bill came out to $ _num_ which is n't bad .
we were disappointed with the food .
there was n't much flavor to the food .
that was some seriously dry , bland food .
the pupusas were crazy delicious though .
i would totally return for these .
one of my worst experience ever my eating pupusas .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
my husband and i had lunch here on one of his day 's off .
obviously , i do n't see a return trip to this place .
they are down to the owners wife as the server .
they ordered after me about _num_ min .
there to go order was ready before my dine in order .
i figured i could find a place with better customer service .
why would u do that to your own business ?
horrible !
the lady has no manners and talks to you like your stupid .
nothing to brag about .
no thank you .
the doctor i met was n't that helpful & courteous .
never spent more than _num_ minutes with me in any of the visits .
he did n't give a clear enough idea about my condition .
wo n't recommend this place to anyone .
why is everyone standing around ?
but no one was really anxious to help me out .
i should have went elsewhere but my car needed it bad .
she 's the most dishonest employee ever .
too bad it ended there .
then my car was towed to a more trusted shop across town .
this is a good place to waste your time looking for customer service .
do n't waste your hard earned money , too .
i had my car serviced here .
after all , they 're yelp reviews are nothing but raving fans .
a trusted , hard working , friendly auto business .
no problem , i tell them .
would you guess i received no response ?
save yourself and do not bring your car to this pep boys service center !
so i believe him and they fix it too .
i went there for a tire patch on my rear left tire .
i was unsure if i could leave or not .
i walk to the employee area he went to and waited .
i paid $ _num_ for all of this .
this pep boys is either dishonest , incompetent , or both .
just terrible , trying to take advantage of people .
only in phoenix .
if this is how they make them now ... um ... alright .
pretzel dogs with bacon and cheese are suppose to have bacon bits .
goodbye forever , sonic .
the customer service at this sonic is horrible !
i know it 's sonic , but c'mon .
it 's called low lights people .
if she was guilty she would be in prison right now .
what i mean is - this is _num_ - the age of technology .
guess i 'll watch fox from now on .
the _num_ guys sounded like they did n't know what they were talking about .
this abc station is very unprofessional .
this abc station is very unprofessional .
this abc station is very unprofessional .
i ca n't believe these people .
this abc station is very unprofessional .
i ca n't believe these people .
this abc station is very unprofessional .
i ca n't believe these people .
bad form !
this abc station is very unprofessional .
i ca n't believe these people .
bad form !
bad .
terrible service .
these guys are idiots and have poor customer service ethic .
worst customer service ever .
customer service is because you want to not because you have to .
the main problem is the walls are very thin .
i can hear conversations from my downstairs neighbors like i was in their apartment .
this place is an absolute nightmare .
they , however promised to find me another location .
huge mistake .
on my tour through the unit it was a disaster .
every time i complained i was promised action that never seemed to come .
i reported this to no reaction from management as well .
this property has become and absolute disaster .
i have been paying online the entire two years and it 's been fine .
hate !
Negative
if i could give negative stars i would .
the laundry room is always in deplorable conditions .
they are not helpful at all .
waste of time !
there is another autozone location on 40th st. and thomas which is far better .
i guess i forgot to mention street noise on this reservation .
this hotel does not allow you to control heat vs. air conditioning .
when they are below _num_ , they turn on the heat .
when they are in between , everything is shut off .
i wo n't be back .
one of the times , they went right past me at the meeting point .
but i wish i stayed at the double tree .
however the service was lacking quite a bit .
with the amount of money we were paying , it should have been perfect .
not , even your normal cockroaches but , gigantic cockroaches .
this restaurant probably has to be the most overrated india eatery in arizona !
went with my family for a weekend lunch buffet and was thoroughly disappointed .
the food was stale and the service was really bad .
have to agree with elizabeth l. about getting some good indian food in phoenix !
they did n't seem very friendly .
i just did n't care for how slow they were .
very bad food and very bad service .
all in all very bad food .
in my opinion , indian food is not a cheap venture .
what happened next is not something i will forget soon .
this time was different , i could not let it go .
i do not really see myself going back here , but who knows .
the quantity was so little for the price and it was really salty .
i still would not be ordering from this place again .
the curry was ok and the tikka masala , well ive had better .
`` is this what i paid $ _num_ for ? ''
`` why did i pay $ _num_ for this ? ''
not lamb ? ''
`` should i finish this or no ?
terrible .
terrible .
terrible .
i visited this restaurant with a phoenix dining card and never got my discount .
a complete waste of money and ruined my day .
the waitstaff is not attentive or helpful in the slightest !
for the price , i would expect better service .
we used to love this place , but the food has gone way downhill .
i took some friends to try indian food for the first time .
the service was not good at all .
sadly i do not and would not recommend this place to anyone .
no apologies .
you 've been warned .
i went to this place on my trip to arizona and phoenix .
just awful .
they do n't care about their customers .
went in at _num_ pm on a sunday .
restaurant had perhaps _num_ tables sat .
waited over _num_ minutes for someone to take our order .
waited another _num_ minutes and left .
second , the _num_ % was added on for the lunch buffet .
the decor was nice but the food , not so such .
i basically just at the chicken marsala and rice , which i enjoyed .
everything else just looked unappetizing due to the presentation .
maybe they do a better job for dinner , i do n't know .
they put green and red bell peppers in the indian food !
i could n't believe it .
it 's not worth the $ _num_ bill .
they served beer that was expired by _num_ months .
they seem to stock old beer .
mediocre food .
i came late afternoon that maybe the reason for the bad service .
the chicken curry was really salty and reheated from that day 's lunch buffet .
the lamb tasted so bad that i ended up not eating it .
seems like they have too much business and are way too busy .
i guess you dont need my business .
if you are indian you will regret it .
it was yellow rice with some boiled chicken some sliced jalapeo and tomato slice .
unfortunately , we were let down .
being that this was a specialty you would think it would be pretty good .
unfortunately more than half of the chunks of `` meat '' were bone .
yes , tough chicken .
the garlic naan was a a little too burnt too .
if there was a no star option , i would have chosen that .
cold , stale food .
bad service .
never ever going back .
maybe i 'm just partial but i did n't enjoy the flavored .
i had a bad day - do n't judge !
do n't be lazy staff - dump and start again .
this place is a homeless shelter .
it 's nasty in there .
after i insisted , they sent someone to pick it up .
this last time was horrible though , really poor & unprofessional customer service .
sorry for my long review .
if i could give this zero stars i would .
trust me , this place is n't worth the cost savings because of her .
not a huge selection of books .
do n't park your car here while traveling .
hotel staff and bus driver said this has happened numerous times .
$ _num_ later , car is fixed .
situation was handled very poorly by hampton inn management .
maybe i stayed here at a bad time .
dingy , dirty , depressing .
holes in wallpaper , stains on carpet and furniture .
not sure if i can even sleep here .
it 's the many room problems which bring my ratings down .
thankfully , none of my stuff was missing .
and the lighting in the bathroom was also badly in need of an upgrade .
what a terrible visit !
the bathroom was a scene out of a horror film .
the sink and bathtub were something you could n't even imagine !
however she did n't even put in my rewards number upon arrival .
after entering my room i went straight to the bed and sat down .
then i walked into the bathroom .
she took down my number so the manager would call me .
that is why i 'm writing this review .
sketchy .
but , c'mon , it 's not that scary .
granted , i ai n't going by myself .
they serve drinks just like anywhere else .
there were lots of blue collar workers just getting off work and relaxing .
the drinks were cheap , darts were fun .
dive bar hell yes , a good one i think not .
the guys shooting pool were no joke either !
i didnt try the food but if i ever go back i surely will .
pool and darts and beer no extras .
i guess i am the only one who is not impressed .
not much has changed .
not that it is a bad thing to remain the same .
the two women who greeted and served us were fine i guess .
but the crust was like shoe leather .
overall probably would n't come back .
the food was awful .
who serves potato skins without sour cream ) .
these three items and one pepsi cost us _num_ dollars before tip .
we will not be back for anything but the occasional pizza and wings .
the food ... is uninspired and bland .
the bread is commercial ( not made in-house ) but pretty tasty .
the red sauce is ... pretty bad .
the veal parmigiana was horrid .
the spaghetti side was forgettable .
i was not impress with the food at all .
we had a half pepperoni , half veggie .
i will never know , because god willing , i will never go back .
finally someone came from the back to seat us in the nearly empty restaurant .
in any case , it was an unprofessional way to deal with the situation .
lame .
i 'm not going back .
decent price , very large portions , weak on flavor .
zero atmosphere .
the salad is standard bagged mix greens and bottled dressing .
the pizza - decent crust , but totally lacking flavor .
chicken parm was crisp and moist but again had no flavor .
the red sauce was also just plain and the side of pasta was overcooked .
there were four of us really early ... the restaurant was pretty much empty .
anyway , they bring out our desserts first !
we ate our desserts and were still waiting for our food !
we went in for a quick bite and it took _num_ hours !
our server however was very poor .
food was mediocre at best .
just really not what i have come to expect .
if you 're looking for true italian food look elsewhere .
nothing bad per se , but nothing good either .
sadly , every time i go the experience is worse and worse .
it 's too bad .
i have no idea what happened , but it 's not good .
i would recommend the food just get it to go .
my granddaughter had the cheese ravioli and the marinara sauce was inedible .
my dog would n't even eat it , it went in the trash .
it was _num_ minutes .
waiting was in the bar with super loud , rude , obnoxious people .
after _num_ minutes , the hostess sat another group who came in after us .
did i mention i was with my mother and _num_ month old baby ?
we put in orders for waters and _num_ beers .
my wife ordered some fried mushrooms and zucchini .
below average to pretty bad .
we got a standard pizza , and it was bad .
soggy in the middle , too dry on the crust .
the sauce was mediocre and the sausage was pretty gross .
it was just a bad overall experience .
it was busy n we waited _num_ minutes roughly .
finally our food came out n the manager gave us _num_ % off .
the pizza was too salty but the wings were delicious .
nothing special ... i would skip it .
she made me sign another lease for my last month and that was that .
if there was a zero star option i would choose that instead .
such a shame !
new management is clueless !
this place sucks .
it sucked so bad , i would never go back .
if anyone told you otherwise , they were lying .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ the bathroom situation is chaos .
the seating is extremely close from one another and the rows are crowded .
none of which sadly , would ever come true .
these girls played for almost an hour ... it was horrible !
i will not be back !
not to mention it 's clearly marked no cameras .
nothing besides tell us to stop `` making trouble '' .
this venue is awful .
i will never return here ; horrible overpriced joke of a venue .
third row is not so bad .
however , the place is old and is in desperate need of a renovation .
it 's a little inconvenient .
we went with a group of people to watch some fights .
i sadly do have complaints about it though .
place was filled with smoke .
obviously terribly managed !
obviously , the facility expected us to buy drinks while we waited .
overall , i 'd avoid this place .
not good customer service !
awful .
for starters , the concert did not start until 8:00 pm .
more women then restrooms and dirty .
reason for _num_ stars ?
my back was sore after _num_ minutes .
... not a good first impression .
also the concession stands are so loud it 's hard to hear the act .
horrible .
the entire two hours was miserable .
however , it needs some serious attention .
the bathrooms and concession stands are thoroughly outdated .
the only reason for the one star was the girlfriends i went with .
i honestly have to say this place is a mess .
my seat was very lumpy .
the place was very dirty .
ridiculous .
some of the worst seating i have ever been in .
hot as hell too .
too small and hot .
do n't recommend going here and i will never go back again !
the venue was a disappointment .
the lack of restrooms was a big deal breaker for me .
so no beer or drinks for me .
my daughter said there were only _num_ stalls in the women 's restroom .
disappointed but i knew that could happen .
over all glad i went because it was heart .
do n't think i would go to this venue again however .
not as good as it used to be , unfortunately !
and they raised the parking to $ _num_ , which is ridiculous .
the seating rows were not marked at all .
parking was $ _num_ coming in .
people were taking up _num_ parking spaces .
we could n't really stand to dance .
that bathroom is small , old and ridiculous .
my biggest problem with the place though is the atmosphere .
it feels more like a big bar than a concert hall .
with your friends and have a party , this might be for you .
no water fountains inside .
ca n't bring water in or even empty water bottles .
just trying to not pass out during my two hours here , you know ?
i would n't go there again .
absolute worst customer service ever .
i asked for a full refund and will take my business elsewhere .
you get what you pay for and this place has zero customer service .
i 'm not sure where i should start .
maybe the fact that it took them three weeks to get artwork to me .
had a horrible experience with this company a few months ago .
my story sounds very similar to the ones posted on here already .
got quoted $ _num_ for each side so $ _num_ total .
they did for free thankfully , did not expect that from apple .
lesson learned , just awful .
you 've been warned .
why was n't this mentioned when i placed the order _num_ days ago ?
really did not like it here at all .
food was not particularly great either .
i will not visit this place again .
it should never take _num_ minutes to get an under toasted english muffin .
wo n't be running back any time soon .
2nd time there , and still such very disappointing place .
it was way to hot , and it was microwaved !
i would not recommend this apartment complex to anyone .
_num_ .
_num_ .
maintenance is a second thought , with little to no urgency .
on top of that , they did n't care enough to find the mail !
_num_ .
less than _num_ minutes from almost every part of the valley .
unfortunately , those are the only two benefits that courtney village offers .
sorry , no dice .
sadly all these things have gone .
they used to have the vehicles towed just for having an expired plate .
nothing ever happens .
they do n't take care about the current and long term residents .
it ca n't come fast enough .
not to mention they 're overpriced .
the staff is very rude .
the gate is constantly broken and there is no security here .
please feel free to contact me before you consider renting here .
i ca n't wait until this lease is up .
courtney village fails .
plus one was destroyed over a year ago and yet to be replaced .
parking is an absolute nightmare and the management will do nothing about it .
there were tons of water bugs that would come up daily in the pipes .
parking , is a nightmare .
the area is a complete nightmare , do not live here .
unfortunately , my good luck has worn off .
the new residents do not care about their surroundings .
they did bomb the building which helped for about _num_ days .
the gates are always broken , along with the spa .
also they started a trash service and they suck !
there 's constantly trash left behind everywhere .
bad really bad start .
upon our return the following week , my girlfriend 's car was stolen .
horrible place !
this was the same story and situation the past _num_ times we stayed here .
slept ok , the bed was fine .
no more again .
i do n't care about the price at this point .
this motel is terrible .
i wo n't be back .
they advertise `` you do n't need no teeth to eat our meat . ''
the last few times , it 's just been kind of `` meh '' .
the meat tastes alright , but nothing special .
unfortunately , it 's not just $ _num_ .
more than that , it was simply not good .
ten years ago this was the bomb !
there are probably _num_ spots and most of them fill up pretty quickly .
the bbq sandwiches at honey bear 's never seem to impress me though .
their is no picking your sandwich up and eating it .
if you try , it is just a mess .
as for food presentation , honey bear 's does n't do so well .
out of forks , out of salad ?
waited _num_ min for cold food ?
i ordered the chicken bbq sandwich ... was not that great .
the chicken meat lacked any flavor .
and the bread of the sandwich was extremely mushy .
plus , no sides and no kid options !
second time i went , same thing , but i got food poisoning !
a busy , well known place like that should n't have that happen .
i 'm never eating there again .
the food was mediocre and the facility is pretty run down .
i 'm confused .
but honey bears has a _num_ star rating .
that 's why i 'm confused .
not sure if it was a bad day or what is going on .
my family was not to impressed either .
hot links were very average .
terrible texture .
honestly , i 've made better bbq at home .
pork was dry .
horrible horrible horrible catfish taste like crunchy cardboard .
wow , we were not just disappointed , we were disgusted .
not too impressed .
the baked beans were way too sweet as is the bbq sauce .
so-so cole slaw and dry meat .
after placing a huge order they said it would be done in _num_ minutes .
after finally getting my food i really was n't impressed .
coleslaw was only tolerable , to soupy and peppery .
the food was lousy .
the ribs tasted like the cow had mad cow disease .
the sauce was weak .
but the ribs were horrible .
this place really needs an overhaul .
it really did not feel clean to me at all .
place was empty , but trash cans were overflowing and dirty .
the tables were not wiped off and there was meat on the floor .
mediocre at best !
you do n't know barbeque that 's for sure .
something is up at the tempe honey bears , and it 's not good .
this was a huge disappointment !
horrible experience .
very disappointed .
new ownership maybe but it 's not the same here .
cashier was n't friendly .
food is just okay , but it is to expensive for what you get .
not real impressed .
sauce was n't all that and sliced beef was tough .
trash can was full , restaurant was n't real clean .
two small sandwiches and two sides came to $ _num_ .
wo n't be back .
did they change owners ?
lunch at honey bears bbq today .
decent flavor but for $ _num_ , i should get more than 2-3 oz .
what a disappointment .
the food was n't very tasty .
the bathrooms will make you leave and not even ask for your money back .
highly disappointed .
having not heard of it , i was in for it .
the aroma went from pecan wood chips to backed up sewage .
as expected from the response , it was mediocre .
never again ... never ... again .
went in today with my friend .
i 'm done with this place and not visiting this again .
i purchased a groupon coupon which had no expiration date .
as a consumer i feel they did not honor their agreement .
the food is very dry and the place is super dirty .
would not recommend .
i do n't believe the food was bad _num_ years ago .
to start the mac and cheese was so off base .
cold .
the collard greens lacked flavor and they were cold .
and the bun was just sad .
the young guy taking our order seemed completely confused .
he 's got ta be losing tons of money from this fool !
i felt very unwelcome here so i will not be back .
if you 're looking for good bbq , go elsewhere .
i 'm not sure what came out .
i was given a half pound of mush , absolutely drenched in bbq sauce .
it was like when you leave shredded wheat in the milk too long .
when i got my plate , it looked like leftovers from _num_ weeks prior !
went straight to the trash along with my $ _num_ .
the guy just did n't care .
there was no ice for the iced tea or soda .
the chicken was disgusting .
it was dry , the outside was hard .
i was really not impressed with the bbq here .
i nor my son wanted to eat it .
the ribs were inconsistent .
some were tasty and moist ; others extremely dry and chewy .
none of them were fall off the bone good .
my mac and cheese was just ... not right .
over priced food , served without a plate , in a real dump .
i would not recommend not the honey bears i remember , counter service sucks .
beer was cheap and cold at _num_ for a bud lite .
the corn on the cobb was hot but old .
beans were good , as was the mac and cheese .
we also had coleslaw and mac & cheese , which was overly salty .
i would get potato salad instead of mac & cheese if we return there .
brought the fam in today what a complete disappointment ... ... .
i asked why and the asian lady said the grill was n't on yet .
by the looks of it only the reviewers care .
how many ways can you spell disappointed !
i got the bbq chicken and my guest got the bbq pulled pork .
total cost : $ _num_ which btw was a great year .
the chicken did not taste fresh .
presentation was horrible !
the bun should have at least been toasted .
i was extremely embarrassed as my friend threw more than half of it away .
i am jeff and i call em as i see em !
very gross !
everyone one said there was no way they would eat that food !
so giving a _num_ , but i would like to make it a _num_ .
i guess it was a zoo of rocks n sticks .
yes , that must be it .
humans do n't put toilets in the kitchen , after all .
but , let 's face it , he 's not .
do n't tell me you have n't noticed .
how gross ! ''
maybe i missed it .
so ridiculous and quite the scam to keep our $ _num_ .
it seriously ruined our trip .
i 've never seen anything like that before .
i was fairly disappointed with this zoo .
it 's way too hot .
what a horrible idea !
what a waste of time !
if you 're looking for enjoyment , do not bother .
skip this next portion if you 're married with kids .
the worst thing about this zoo is the price .
a small salad costs $ _num_ .
a bottle of water is $ _num_ .
yes , i 'm complaining about the cost of two adults .
she must have needed a depends change and that would explain her crappy attitude .
this is primarily a hot weather zoo .
a lot of cages are empty and you get disappointed .
the animal selection was pathetic .
i do not recommend going during the afternoon on a hot day .
$ _num_ for a bottle of soda !
$ _num_ for a hot dog !
well now it is up to $ _num_ and still way overpriced .
did n't see much !
i would have given it a zero if it was an option .
take your money elsewhere .
it was ok , but just ok .
zoo itself is in a mediocre state of repair .
a frozen lemonade was almost $ _num_ !
hey _num_ tickets is a lot to paid & nothing to see .
there are some places you have to pay additional money for the rides .
will not return , one time is enough .
very poorly planned if you have kids under _num_ who want to walk .
i would suggest heading west to the wildlife world zoo .
for adults , not much to see and the zoo itself is small .
not worth it .
the animals are old , often hiding behind something .
it is highly over priced .
food was not the best .
a regular ticket does n't include much except walking around .
who was working the front gate called me a dick .
you are not gon na believe this , i 'm still in shock .
worst interaction with any employee ever .
( at this point i was n't mad , just wanted to leave ) .
he totally denied everything after that and did n't admit anything !
they did tell us one was closed but failed to mention the other _num_ .
even the seasonal ( yes , summer items ) were closed .
just way to high and not nearly enough bang for the buck .
poorly done .
the price point was ridiculous as well .
and the people at the zoo missed some opportunities .
she was not even remotely apologetic or sympathetic towards us .
i complained to the phoenix zoo and never heard back .
disappointment !
some animals were out but most were not .
do n't get the chicken sandwich its gross !
big deal when it 's _num_ degrees out .
also with many of the exhibits closed it was a bit pricey .
horrible class field trip , do not do the night camp !
we had a cold hard breakfast , and restroom use was hardly allowed .
poor quality , it seems run down and not very welcoming .
would not recommend !
_num_ stars might be two too many .
just relocated to phoenix so we thought we would try out the zoo .
do n't waste your time .
general adult admission $ _num_ .
the animals look hot and tired .
we spent _num_ 1/2 hrs walking around and never really got excited .
basically , the letter that was sent to us was bs bs bs !
very _num_ .
$ _num_ to the airport via taxi .
not so much here .
could have saved me time but just telling me that in the first place .
whole city block is out of water .
i 'm a gold member so i had access to the concierge level .
i hate to write a bad review of a marriott property .
probably one of the most frustrating things is their concierge lounge .
not very marriott if you ask me .
not impressed with this locale .
there was a dirty shirt next to my room door upon arriving .
i have never experienced such disappointment in my life at my fave hotel chain .
do not put a client in a wet carpet room .
this was a lie as there were no cops on site .
there was nothing she could do because they were paying guests .
this is not a corporate marriott !
rude staff and the worst service i have ever received from a marriott .
dont waste your money here !
hotel is marginal .
uninspired cuisine .
i was so confused what was happening .
not a vacation destination .
on the upside , it is very close to the airport and the _num_ .
needs updating badly !
wont stay here again until it gets a much needed remodeling .
car was broken into .
i 'm out over $ _num_ .
trash was still in the trash bins .
strange locked closet in my room .
absolute bs - your _num_ miles from the airport .
the end of my time at this hotel is over , checking out tomorrow .
absolute joke of a hotel with completely ignorant staff .
avoid this place at all costs .
my huge complaint and the reason for a _num_ star .
_num_ . )
she said no `` complementary for guest '' but , tip is not included .
i get in around 10pm and i did exactly what the clerk told me .
now , this is my first time here at phoenix airport .
they told me it 's about _num_ minutes from here .
walk down this long hallway and i 'll be at my destination .
and i had no clue just thought it was the standard pick up area .
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
um burrito or taco ?
bad call .
first of all , i had to repeat my order three times .
not a tough one , and no special order .
however , he said they can give me an iced vanilla coffee instead .
no way , jose .
if i did n't have a coupon , i would n't have gone .
i 'll be throwing the other coupons in the trash .
just not worth the aggravation .
did n't give me a straw .
did n't put the lime in the fish tacos .
no lemon in my ice tea .
like taco bell , but not as fancy .
the friday night bartender was great but she quit !
good morning , is that the overwhelming smell of dog piss i 'm smelling ?
there is no hot water .
roaches are still present anywhere there is a drain .
nothing new here .
garbage stays on the grounds for days .
the water goes off without warning .
the plug for my bedroom lamp turns on by itself .
the sidewalk and stairs too .
the buildings are old and the upstairs heat up something awful .
dishes pulled from the cabinets often had bug crap on them .
the grounds are very poorly kept in places beyond the front office area .
the water in the apartments get turned off randomly without any warning .
your neighbors will break the rules in the lease agreement at every turn .
this past year has been pretty rough and i 'm disappointed .
since then , they moved it but not the same stall .
i 'm confused why it is n't allowed now .
you 're not allowed shade ?
i 'm not as happy here as i once was .
not a good year at all .
the gate seems to be always broken .
i see homeless people going through trash bins at all times of the day .
two tires has been stolen .
i no longer feel safe living here .
absolute worst apartments ever !
it just so happens that the office 's phone lines are down .
_num_ .
i do n't believe that happened , and i still have roaches .
_num_ .
_num_ .
there are gates , but no good if they do n't work .
`` no code or key required ! ''
same complaints by different people .
ca n't wait to put the roach motel in my rear view mirror .
do n't make the mistake that i did .
not impressed at all .
there are far more tastier places in the valley to spend your money on .
if i could leave a half star i would .
it 's a charming place to sit , but a disappointing place to eat .
there 's better mexican food in phoenix , go find it .
then she tells me they ran out of tamales .
there were barley enough rice and beans to cover the plate .
went here at _num_ at night and was already shaking in my heels .
they have a variety of stuff , but not a good selection of anything .
worst food city , i 've ever been to .
unorganized , no deli , no bakery , little staff , rude cashier .
worst apartments i have ever been in .
then on top of that there are alot of break ins in this location .
my window ended up getting broke one night by i dont know who .
i complained to manager but she told me it was nothing she could do .
this place is extremely noisy !
( maintenance did n't know i was in there ) .
they could n't have done it that fast .
the roaches never left .
but it was our $ _num_ .
the tenants that live there do n't care about other peoples property !
it will break again within a week , repeat process .
this place is horrible .
management does n't care , defensive and rude .
maintenance problems take forever to get fixed .
gates do n't close at night so anyone can come and go .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
real pieces of garbage , not the complex but the staff .
i would not want any of my friends to be treated so poorly .
they do not have information cards at each fire truck .
do n't waste your money .
do n't go here if you have small children .
this is a museum for _num_ and up .
children _num_ and under are free .
adults pay _num_ dollars as of jun _num_ .
im _num_ feet and it was my on level with my neck .
the woman especially was quite mean to my seven year old .
my _num_ year old promptly apologized which was ignored by her .
her behavior was not appreciated and not appropriate .
i wo n't be going there again .
do n't let the outside appearance fool you !
needless to say ... do n't rent here .
also , and i ca n't stress this enough , read your lease thoroughly !
this complex is not interested in customer service .
it 's been one ridiculous thing after the other .
i am so sick of this place !
horrible horrible property management !
luckily we never had any major repairs .
do not rent here .
staff in the front office is horribly rude .
they do n't care about their residents at all .
before i gave them _num_ star because of the staff .
if i could give them zero stars i would easily .
my dryer has not worked since i moved in .
just do n't wait until you live here for months .
it only gets worse .
that is _num_ months when i signed a _num_ month lease .
awful awful awful place to live .
if i could give this _num_ stars i would .
their website for paying rent is terrible .
the problem with this place is the inept or non-existent customer service .
the washer stopped working and the dishwasher broke about _num_ months into living here !
i wish there was a no star rating !
they are old apartments and are falling apart !
this morning i had the unfortunate experience of having a flat tire .
he just drove away !
which is really unreasonable .
they took _num_ weeks to fix it and the patch job is a joke .
it looks like it might fall out of the ceiling any second .
the area around the complex is n't safe for going on walks .
it 's not safe any other direction .
i would n't pay more than _num_ a month to live here .
not worth it .
i would run _num_ minutes and it would just randomly shut off .
_num_ .
otherwise the customer service was terrible .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
none of the screens fit properly .
appliances are terrible .
the maintenance manager asked what happened to my hand , i told him .
he signed the papers to hold a unit and put down a security deposit .
Neutral
if i could rate in the negatives i would .
been two weeks and nothing has been done .
spend just over $ _num_ to get a coolant leak fixed .
he made me wait , taking phone call after phone call in another room .
so i 'll look elsewhere next time my car needs service .
this is not the place to go for dinner .
they have limited evening hours and it 's for a good reason .
i can put up with a lot of things for a cheap dinner .
i do n't need good customer service .
i do n't need to eat in a safe neighborhood .
i 'm not expecting gourmet , either .
sure , come for lunch .
wow , this place is awful .
it 's a lot more like _num_ .
terrible customer service .
they charged me twice by mistake and did n't get a refund for it .
just terrible overall , but what do you expect , it was $ _num_ .
but does n't mean they can charge me twice for their crappy motel room .
just pay an extra $ _num_ to go somewhere else .
its pretty obvious this is not the four seasons paris .
there is no fridge or ice maker .
and smoked brisket , oh yeah , smoked brisket .
good deal for _num_ bucks near an international airport , in a major city .
we did n't get our room key until the next morning .
our room did not contain a coffee maker or microwave .
the remote for the tv was broken .
the fire alarm is missing the battery .
the room was n't the cleanest .
the mattress is covered with dirty plastic .
if i could choose no stars i would .
there is nothing good about this property .
avoid if possible !
room was gross and walls were paper thin .
the environment was very sketchy and unsafe .
um ... check in time was 3pm ?
they would n't accommodate and said other hotels are worse .
um ... no .
this place needs to be shut down by the health department .
the worst room i have ever stepped foot into in my life .
and they will not refund your money after you see the room .
no , no , no and no !
it does n't even deserve a single star .
the room was flat out unclean .
i can not make this up .
i did n't even mention the kicker .
_num_ .
why are you charging people for rooms that are not even completed ?
i will say the vending machine has some ice cold beverages .
worst experience of my life .
hotel would not refund me my money .
honestly , that bad .
the tile was cut and uneven and somebody will cut their foot eventually .
i can not stress enough how bad this place is .
_num_ dollars would be too much .
the place is a `` no go '' !
_num_ light bulbs were missing in the bathroom .
the walls are even dirty , the tv is an old tube type .
my room did not have a working smoke alarm .
the water pressure was very good .
it is very close to sky harbor airport .
i was forced to give it _num_ star or you can not post .
worst hotel ever !
then we get our luggage and stuff is missing .
i ca n't believe the way they run there business .
this hotel is not safe !
this hotel is bad !
can i rate a zero ?
the manager did not seem to care and was very unprofessional .
do n't stay here though .
seriously no soap in the bathroom just a face towel ?
expedia what have you gotten me into ?
unfortunately not .
i purchased the full detail $ _num_ and hand wax $ _num_ .
i was very disappointed .
please avoid this place at all costs .
easily the worst car wash ever .
they take no pride in their work .
i have never had a worse wash in my life .
but he had no change so i had to give him _num_ $ .
wrong .
the clerk kept telling us that sunday through thursday was the more expensive price .
we get to the room , and it looked ok , at first glance .
it had a flat sheet that was a foot shorter than the mattress .
that meant they left a foot of exposed mattress where our feet touched .
_num_ plus tax .
it 's only _num_ for a king size smoking room .
i advise everyone to stay away from this hotel .
if i could have given it less than one star , i would have !
horrible place to stay .
dirty carpet , i do n't think it can be cleaned .
i was a little disappointed .
however i think they have the settings a little too high .
very poor conditions , both fairways & greens .
i would rate this as the worst course i have played in az .
also the green fee of $ _num_ is ridiculous .
i gave them _num_ stars because the course was in good shape .
the rest of the cultural center was empty and advertising for rent space .
what a disappointment , especially for the biggest holiday of the year !
sad because i hoped phoenix could do better .
not the best but not the worst chinese food .
soup was nothing special .
egg roll almost flavorless and mushy .
no ability to substitute lo mein for rice .
cold salad next to hot entree next to hot rice .
check was delivered halfway through meal .
flavoring is not consistent .
double serving .
counter service were really poor as you have to wait and look for them .
maybe because i went for lunch ... do n't know .
disappointing !
_num_ .
_num_ .
the hot braised shrimp had dry little baby shrimps with virtually no sauce .
_num_ .
the kung pao chicken had a slight odor to it .
i thought the flavor was okay but it was nothing special .
_num_ .
_num_ .
we dined at _num_ pm and the restaurant was empty .
_num_ .
the restaurant itself was fairly nice but nothing that stood out .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the menu was unimpressive .
it was the most generic chinese menu i 've seen .
_num_ .
this place claims to be an authentic shanghai restaurant but it was so americanized .
now as far as hot pot goes , it 's a failure .
the food itself was more like seafood soup .
may be i was expecting too much .
the food ... was passable but not amazing .
i 've had great chinese food but this was just okay .
so overall it was ok but certainly i would think twice before coming back .
the beef noodle soup was not tasty .
i will not be returning again .
ugh .
they told me _num_ minutes , and they were accurate .
i could n't eat any of it .
the soup ( hot and sour ) was way too sour .
the egg roll was just gross .
the fortune cookie was stale , and the fortune was even lame .
i would 've done better to get soaking wet and hit up panda express .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
do not give the customer the bill before they are done eating .
_num_ .
_num_ .
do not use a mexican chef .
biggest mistake of the month .
the fried pork chops were way overcooked and dry .
at first glance , it seemed like a pretty nice restaurant .
in that particular dish , the beans should have been dried .
the pork chops were worse though .
and that old oil taste stayed in my mouth long after dinner was over .
i will not be returning .
lame .
not authentic .
but again , this is not new york ... .
ancient chinese secret my ass .
and she had the nerve to check my body for needles marks .
poor service in the pharmacy is common .
this is strange for a place that was built around the pharmacy business .
pharmacy is entirely too slow .
but these were christmas presents and i needed them tonight .
my mistake that i wo n't make again .
could n't possibly be more annoyed .
no hello .
terrible customer service , i wo n't be back .
i called my doctor and she was able to fix it in _num_ mins .
drive through has a _num_ minute wait and there was no line .
made reservations months in advance and no car was available .
a man at the hotel the first night had reservations too .
the decisions were made above her .
terrible service .
however , i will not be renting from this location again .
too much !
why would you give out a dirty car ?
windows were covered in a film that we cleaned off while filling the tank .
very difficult to see out while in reverse .
such a terrible customer service experience !
my mom was coming into town to visit and wanted to hire a car .
no big deal , we will just return it for another one .
our mistake was doing this on a weekend .
what a mistake .
this location wo n't let you rent here without a major credit card .
he said no , they would not under any circumstances take debit .
to make a long story short , beware of this rental company .
they obviously do n't clean inside or out of car .
i will never rent here again !
i talked to the manager and she just said sorry .
so bad !
i ca n't wait to move my accounts to my airline credit union .
terrible phone customer service !
was this woman clueless or just on a power trip ?
she gave the `` oh well '' attitude .
frustrating to say the least !
they did n't even bother to ask why or keep my business .
horrible place .
disappointing .
terrible meal !
never going back !
their prices are ridiculous for the portion sizes i was seeing .
she ( i 'm assuming she is the owner ) was beyond rude .
i walked out .
not only were they rude but their service is horrible .
incredibly disappointed in this place .
the chile relleno seemed as if it was stuffed a few days prior .
the rice was old and hard .
the beans served on all of our dishes were entirely inedible .
it was a red salsa and tasted like it was homemade .
i will never visit this place again .
i 'm here now and this place is beyond disgusting !
the server is so rude and the meat is covered in grease !
worse service ever !
no .
just ... no .
horrible .
_num_ cents each .
they were so bad , i could n't even force myself to finish them .
the asada was in big , tough pieces .
pastor was literally chunks of ground pork .
green chile beef was practically inedible .
i ca n't .
it 's not worth it , even for _num_ cent tacos !
anyhow , they said they did n't know how long the car would work .
my experience here this past weekend was mediocre at best .
we walk in the door , are seated , and handed the simple menu .
nothing of interest on the menu .
tried the kung pao shrimp and veg chow mien .
service was also not good .
not satisfied .
we figured , why not try a more traditional chinese place ?
the menu looked alright , like a typical small chinese restaurant .
i have to say , it was terrible .
lunch menu , pepper beef -- no better than _num_ stars .
wo n't go again .
everything else was mediocre at best .
i would n't recommend this place at all .
moral of the story : gross .
flavorless .
a gigantic waste of time and money .
we 're so disappointed .
i went to this restaurant with a group of seven other coworkers .
it was at lunchtime , so the place was a little busy .
however , we waited about _num_ minutes to be helped .
it was disgusting , i would n't recommend ordering it .
place was packed at lunch , maybe i ordered the wrong dish ?
man , we were really looking forward to this .
there were warning signs right away .
but lots of other stuff did bother me .
everything else was bland ... including the hot pot .
the waiter disappeared for about twenty minutes at a time .
just a bad customer service experience and average food .
i arrived for lunch at 11am and was seated immediately .
the atmosphere was ok , and the bar looked a bit disorganized .
i will not be returning to this place .
average to a little less than average .
staff was rushed and left me to call them over to get our check .
waitress then looked at her tip with me sitting there .
however , their sauces were bland .
rice was a tad dry .
went in and was promptly seated .
apparently they did n't want to serve us .
we also had to wait a bit long for the food order .
rude yes , but nothing else got any kind of attention .
no excuse for a place with people at only _num_ % of the tables .
bad service , so so food and dishonest representation .
problem is , the coupon did not state that .
its called `` bait and switch '' draw them in with a false ad .
not the best but not the worst chinese food .
soup was nothing special .
egg roll almost flavorless and mushy .
no ability to substitute lo mein for rice .
cold salad next to hot entree next to hot rice .
maybe my experience would have been better ?
probably the food but i doubt the service .
check was delivered halfway through meal .
horrible experience .
it was water boiled spicy beef .
no offer to exchange it for something else .
bad customer service as far as i 'm concerned .
tip for the owners this is america , not china .
went with an open mind to try something new and out of the ordinary .
terrible food and service to match .
went today for early sunday dinner and will not go back .
service was beyond horrible and food just ok at best .
also too expensive for what you get .
the worst experience ever .
will never return here .
no middle ground will be offered .
cantonese is sweeter with a semi thick sauce .
limited english staff .
about _num_ % of their patrons are actually chinese with limited english .
was n't expensive for the type of food served .
this was the worst food and the worst service i 've ever experienced !
the food came out exactly _num_ minutes after ordering .
was hard as a rock as they had over cooked what was already made .
would never step foot in that place again .
staff was rude , unfriendly and unprofessional .
the food was over priced and too salty .
when i called the lady answering barely understood what i was asking for .
i asked for lunch special and she sounded lost .
this was my first time at sp .
within _num_ minutes after getting the appetizer our entree came out .
it really worries me when food comes out that fast .
all the food tasted old and refried and the fried rice was mushy .
horrible !
this is the main reason why i gave this place _num_ stars .
however , service was terrible .
each of our four person party 's entrees was delivered 5-10 minutes apart .
also , staff was rude .
do n't recommend .
the absolute worst restaurant experience in years .
pork ribs were broken bones deep fried with disgusting sweet sauce .
ordered what he recommended and it was disgusting .
yes disgusting .
dim sum came out _num_ min later with pink pork inside .
the owners should be ashamed .
overall the _num_ stars is due to the horrible service received .
walked in , host seating us without any greeting .
gross !
but i guess that is what sells ... .
so sad ... .
gross !
it was already after _num_ so i would have eaten anything .
well , i could n't eat the lunch i got from here .
i got _num_ bites in before i gave up .
even the egg roll was disgusting and i 'll eat anything fried .
named a sichuan palace but taste like panda express .
i could n't get through 1/4 of the cup .
chicken : the chicken pieces were tiny and the breading was way excessive .
i tasted very little chicken and the sauce was drenched in vinegar .
i had such a bad stomach ache afterwards .
way tasteless , pork was gross and mushy and just overall a poor dish .
save your money and time , avoid this place .
the dish was literally _num_ % peppers and _num_ % chicken .
i wo n't be ordering there again .
this place is the last place i would eat unless i 'm not paying .
this place is unprofessional and a complete joke .
i am not a patient .
the building does n't even open til 8am .
this is unacceptable !
this place is horrible .
paradise lost , one might say .
the airport is beautiful but the surrounding area is not .
hotel is rather nasty .
it was all locked up ( more to follow on that ) .
curtains were ill fitting , going over the window a/c heater system and blowing .
below the heater though , that 's where the magic was found .
not gon na be staying here again .
you 've lost me on this one .
but no .
we got into the room , which was spacious and mostly clean .
just awful .
lesson learned , eh jay ?
a couple of things he missed though .
and i did n't turn it on to find out .
and there were some bright spots .
still , avoid this one like the plague .
do n't waste your time or money here .
after _num_ minutes , no food .
i have had worse , but not often .
the cook on duty tonight was simply incompetent .
this is probably a bad thing .
to call this mediocre is generous .
very disappointed !
ordered delivery , food was cold and bland .
worst general tso chicken ever tasted .
there was only one car in the parking lot .
i made a yelp account just to write a bad review about this place .
this place is just awful .
get in your _num_ degree car and drive down to jack in the box .
apparently they were short staffed so the `` waitress '' was doing a delivery .
i felt their service was horrible and it was their mistake .
money is too precious to waste on places like this .
this place is horrible do not ever i repeat ever !
this is true , i believe i saved around $ _num_ on the phone .
the complimentary case was cheap and i threw it in the trash .
the car charger will definitely be useful .
i also had to wait a few days to get my phone .
it was more than the _num_ day delivery that they advertise .
however this did n't bother me especially since i just saved some dough .
um , never had this problem at any other costco .
she is just a worker standing by the door like you .
i thought i was buying that from costco .
turns out i was n't .
i guess that 's fine for a regular car , but not for mine .
maybe i 'm doing it wrong .
so then why do i go here , you may ask .
diet coke , allergy meds and giant bags of frozen chicken breast .
why do i hate it so ... ?
they completely stop paying attention to what 's going on around them .
wan na know why ?
no thanks .
i 'll pay _num_ cents more per gallon somewhere else .
and for now , sadly , the answer is yes .
terrible experience signing up for membership .
lots of inappropriate comments .
we already hate it here and we just joined .
big mistake .
you only get one chance to make a good first impression .
terrible .
no flavor .
not impressed so wo n't be buying that again .
why is this so difficult to order a birthday cake from costco ?
seriously , this should n't be this difficult !
i left a voicemail requesting the refill by that afternoon .
why could n't she do that ?
he yelled at me as i left , but i ignored him and left .
they must not want me as a customer .
however ... ... lines have been really slow lately .
waited _num_ minutes to get through .
the one thing that kept me going back was their deals on tires .
i guess you could say i have been here _num_ times .
the first time was last summer and i just felt ill all over .
i was in the actual exam room for what seemed like _num_ hours .
finally they wrote me a prescription and i was on my way .
she was at a loss for words but then basically told me no .
there were _num_ people ahead of me !
i would give it zero stars if i could .
everything about this place is beyond awful .
in fact all of these clinics are terrible .
i try to avoid going to urgent care unless i am dying .
came back after two weeks because i still was sick .
although there was no line , i saw the doctor for approximately _num_ seconds .
i doubt my co pay and health insurance appreciated such a pathetic effort .
husband went about a year ago .
she is a navy veteran , served in war and everything .
this actually looks like some sort of bite !
should n't the doctor have done that ?
please , do not waste your time and money .
tried to call for _num_ days to set up a time to come in .
who is extremely rude and proceeds to tells i can either wait or leave .
i know i will never be back .
horrible experience !
horrible experience .
online system says check in to reserve your spot .
i arrive _num_ min later and they say check in does n't matter .
only one other patient was there , and one other showed up after us .
_num_ % agree with all the other _num_ star reviewers .
did n't seem to be in any kind of hurry to assist us .
)
_num_ .
sounds extremely inefficient and i doubt other urgent cares work that way .
_num_ .
i 'm sure it sucks working for a bad company .
so , again , avoid this place at all costs .
i ca n't eat much and bread is off the menu .
what i got was a charred hockey puck .
btw , i can not figure out why two reviews are filtered .
they seem on the up and up .
the food service is painfully slow .
drinks and food are n't that different from applebees down the street .
i would recomend going here just for the experience .
food is not the greatest but a heck of a deal for the specials .
not my cup of tea .
very poor service , very limited menu of deep fried and processed foods .
definitely a place to frequent if you `` want to be left alone '' .
i 've given this place multiple chances but every time i 'm disappointed .
i will not go back .
i should have read all the reviews before sitting down to eat .
shame on me for assuming things .
the soups were horrible and looked they had being sitting there all week .
the pizza was n't even pizza but crust with sauce on it .
not a sweet tomatoes that 's for sure .
watery mac n cheese .
the soup is not hot , like it should be .
service- nonexistent .
they take your money and off you go .
i do n't feel i got what i paid for .
it 's nothing special , but then again it 's a buffet .
the food just was n't that good .
the pizza , mac n cheese , and tacos were horrible .
it just tasted really cheap .
the ice cream ( or frozen yogurt ) machine was out of service .
ok , so i had the $ _num_ lunch .
tomatoes do not sweat .
had to ask for it , same with pizza .
however , i was definitely let down by this location .
maybe they just need more staff for a sunday after church lets out ?
secondly , they do n't clean the tables too often .
noon and i 'm starving !
be very careful .
however this location does not deserve your business .
i simply ordered a veggie and cheese .
... ... end result ... .
poor service .
get out of here guy you 're cheap and offer the worst customer service .
how funny the owners name is `` mike s '' !
at this point i was so over the experience entirely .
no customer service not clean and ca n't make a sandwich for shit .
pretty terrible experience here .
first off , this place is in a pretty bad part of town .
then when we placed our order , we waited another _num_ minutes .
they did n't even offer to comp the drinks lol .
she thinks cilantro is exotic and caesar salads are too spicy .
applebee 's is n't terrible .
not only is the food overpriced and barely edible , the service is horrible !
i doubt that we will revisit that establishment anytime soon .
the worst applebees in town .
it 's kinda my fault .
but most applebee 's i 've frequented have been decent .
but the food was n't up to par .
spinach & artichoke appetizer was so-so .
not much flavor .
my wife had the blackened chicken & penne pasta .
the chicken breast was overcooked and dry .
should have went to get burgers at five guys in the same parking lot .
do n't waste your time .
the server was over the top obnoxious .
he insisted on having our names just to take our order .
he was very friendly but it was to the point of intrusive .
when i ordered my food he insisted that i order something different .
when i finally got my food it was mediocre at best .
the manager made me hate this place even more .
that was unacceptable to me !
i guess that does n't apply !
its probably another scam to bring customers in .
probably not going to this place anymore more for late night food .
do not eat here .
terrible .
i do n't like this location .
i drive further down the road just for the better service .
we have to flag him down .
i 'm so sorry to inconvenience you !
i order baby c some steamed broccoli and a juice .
j 's and my food come out as ordered .
baby c does n't seem to mind .
drinks ... he 's on the ball with refills of my water .
but misses the mark with j 's root beer refill .
he brings him dr. pepper instead .
wrong !
you literally could n't pay me to go here ever again .
however , things have changed and standards seem to be much lower .
in short , the service was slow and the food was disgusting .
was not impressed with my too oily & tasteless shrimp meal .
i walked out wishing i went to chili 's .
fish and chips were crispy on the outside and still cold on the inside .
service was quick , except for the replacement meal taking forever .
no idea of organization or time management .
the one manager is very condescending & could care less .
could be a major reason this applebee 's is going downhill .
they both have more responsible employees & managers that care .
to wait too long .
i will not be going back for some time .
this experience was very frustrating .
servers were rude .
i was reminded why i stop going , the menu sucks .
anyway what a waste of time and money .
i said , `` are u kidding me ?
why the hell ?
the music was so loud that the seating host could barely here my request .
not a chance .
it is n't surprising that this place is only _num_ stars .
this place is awful to order togo from !
never again will i order togo from this awful place !
he did n't return until _num_ minutes later to take our order .
but for now , do n't go .
this was the worst experience i 've ever had at a restaurant .
are food came _num_ minutes later .
only been to applebee 's a few times but never this location .
i wish i would have said something .
i have spend my whole day off from work sick as ever .
too slow .
do n't see any food coming out of kitchen .
so they are not too busy making food .
terrible service and terrible dry food i would n't recommend !
after waiting another _num_ mins , she finally picked up the check .
as she did it she snapped the book and walked away .
worst service i 've had ever !
they always play music way too loud .
i like to talk to the person or people i am dining with .
service is sloppy .
the carpet looked like the floor of a new york taxi .
they push drinks and deserts to the point of being obnoxious .
food is bad .
cold food and waited forever till anyone came to get our drink order .
worst experience .
he had _num_ beer prior .
there was so much gristle , you could n't chew through it .
i 'd have been my normal sarcastic self had my parents not been there .
they cooked the steak longer but you ca n't get away from gristle .
i guess the cooks like everything rare !
the food did not taste good at all .
i was very disappointed with the food .
the theme for the lunch was dry .
the mac and cheese was ... dry .
the chicken was ... dry .
the wings were ... dry .
i really love applebees so it is a disappointment to rate then this low .
sadly , the chips were the kind you bit from the store .
salsa was soo small there was no point .
had no bacon and it just looked a hot mess !
fries were small portion and soggy .
such a shame .
food is mediocre .
i sent an email to corporate , never heard back .
if i could give them zero stars i would .
the service sucked , took forever to even get a drink order in .
and my friends baked potato was rotten !
so nasty !
never again stepping foot in this place !
i have been in here numerous times and every time seems to get worse .
it 's pretty ridiculous .
i try to avoid this place as much as possible .
not good !
overcooked food , pre made drinks , and underwhelming service .
i hate you .
if i order extra cheese they forget it .
that 's me .
i called them after he returned and once again they were very rude .
i can be told no - just do n't celebrate it .
i am very disappointed with this landscaping business .
right now i 'm really disappointed .
only frozen meat , one type of sausage .
i walked out without buying anything .
walking into macayo 's is like entering a buffet restaurant in a vegas casino .
tacky , tacky , tacky .
i really like the mini chicken chimichangas .
greasy chips , tasteless watery salsa and horrible food !
i am not sure why people like this place .
but i have wasted enough money at their restaurants .
i came back here last weekend and i was so disappointed .
essentially , macayo 's is one of the staple eateries of phoenix .
it 's so sad to see macayo 's in the state .
the margs were watery and low on the alcohol .
never been to another macayos but not gon na try after that visit .
one word can describe this place gross !
the salsa was lame , the chips stale .
and the food at macayo 's is none of those .
the spanish rice was the worst i 've ever had .
the house salsa was ok but i 've had better from a jar .
macayo 's sucks and i 'm not afraid to say it .
bland red sauce , not crispy , and not served hot .
hubby said his fajitas were pretty good but my burro was gross .
the flan was ok & the chocolate chimis with ice cream were pretty good .
total with tip & free delivery was about $ _num_ .
a once phoenix staple has turned into complete and utter crap .
things have taken a big turn for the worse .
its hard to find anything under $ _num_ .
the food ( even the side of veggies ) was sooo greasy and fatty .
the baja sauce lost its kick .
the guac had no flavor .
i regret eating here .
-- salsa _num_ to _num_ days old .
shame on you !
-- refried beans go the same way .
did n't finish them ?
just throw in a bit of lard and put 'em back on the fire .
-- sopapillas for shame !
you could n't force feed me this shit !
highly disappointing after we tried it , and we crossed it off our list !
the salsa was crap and there was no chile verde .
the veggies are ice cold with tons of butter and barely cooked .
the chicken tasted like they been freezer burned and no seasoning .
the dish was n't appetizing at all .
just drop off the check and walk away .
i am on to your tricks ... no thanks ! )
please hire a waitress that has a brain and is n't slow !
worst mango and strawberry margaritas ever !
_num_ .
_num_ .
they got one order completely wrong .
now we have to wait another _num_ minutes for her food .
before we can open our mouth to remedy this he is gone .
i have never done that before .
cheese , refried beans , tomatoes , sour cream and guacamole .
the carpeting is tired .
it took our server _num_ minutes to come and get our drink order .
one member of our party ordered a coke and it was totally flat .
i had a chicken taco and the chicken tasted canned .
honestly , tasted like taco bell on a poor day .
i ordered a california burrito , for almost $ _num_ .
the tortilla was stale , and the flavor was just not there .
being from california , i 'm offended that they call this a california burrito !
not even a jar -- a can .
overpriced , stale fast-food .
i got the baja chicken quesadilla and it was fairly dry and bland .
there were hardly any people in the restaurant , what took so long ?
no wonder the taco was burnt .
but the black slimy stuff on the red pepper , what was that ?
also , no specials at happy hour time ( 4:30 on a weekday ) .
never waited very long , 1st steak fajitas seems fine .
additionally , our service was inattentive when it occurred and non-existent at other times .
if it 's my choice , i wo n't be back .
drinks are expensive .
service is awful .
the decor is just awful .
macayos is like chuck e. cheese without the games .
here , you just kind of bang your own head on the table .
noticed floors ( with ugly casino carpet ) were very dirty .
two parties that came in after us were seated next to dirty tables .
my meal was relatively flavorless .
the margaritas that were `` on sale '' were sugary and weak .
it 's sad to see this landmark on central in decline .
the bar : very disappointed .
music too loud .
too ethnic .
poor set up with entrance outside the restaurant .
the server left the menu 's on our table after we ordered .
i had the steak fajitas and my date had shrimp fajitas .
we had the margaritas that were on special and they were terrible .
the chimichanga was awful .
huge , but awful .
it was soggy and bland .
service was bad despite being the only people in the restaurant .
eh ... no .
the cheese crisp should be skipped .
there 's no flavor .
salsa tastes like it 's made from canned tomatoes .
chicken chimichanga was ok .
the place was relatively empty and too low of lighting to see anything .
there should n't even be an option for a star .
the service is horrible and bartenders are very rude .
i would n't recommend this place to anyone not even my worst enemy !
the chips tasted stale and the salsa was pretty gross too .
oh my gosh , they were even worse !
soggy , covered in sour cream and what i think was guacamole ?
i would n't recommend this place to anyone .
went to macayo 's on central last night for dinner .
huge mistake .
today i still have an after taste of grease .
this clearly does n't describe this place .
that would paint a picture like bob ross on this damn place .
do n't worry ... hunger is that last thing on my mind .
no , no , no , no .
the service was fine but the food was awful .
for the prices they charge , you have a right to expect better food .
this place has gone downhill .
i requested a table below a fan because they keep this place too warm .
that was a mistake .
after all this , my coworker gets a dirty soup spoon .
she requests another and ends up with another dirty one .
she requests another spoon - again - and my daughter requests one as well .
so disappointing to see what has happened here .
the chips were good but the salsa was very bland and watery .
the beef was ok but really did n't care for the cheese sauce .
the rest of my family said their food was just ok .
i really expected it to be better .
the margaritas which macayos calls `` the best in phoenix '' are not .
just do n't waste your money on them .
the food is decent but bland .
flat , old tasting soda .
burned cheese crisp .
i will never go to that location again !
never even addressed the terrible service we received !
my husband had the macayo tour meal and the portions were very small .
also the margaritas were very weak and tasted like water .
security was extremely lazy in getting management when i wanted to speak to him .
horrible graduation dinner .
i 've been to eat better places at lower prices .
the outside of the building drew me in but the inside needs an overhaul .
the place itself needs to be remodeled .
but inside is really outdated , restrooms are small and stingy looking .
a friend ordered something , i tried a bite and was not impressed .
definately wo n't go back unless dragged by friends like today .
we only saw our waiter perhaps _num_ times the entire evening .
Negative
there was nothing really negative one can say about the food .
like its out fault we did n't get service ?
so we get seated and still had to wait forever for chips and drinks .
i 'm never returning to this macayos !
not anymore !
once again , i end up with a terrible server .
this place has a serious staffing problem .
i just do n't understand why they ca n't get pleasant and qualified staff .
poor service , dirty restroom .
bland is a complement .
taco bell has more seasonings .
by far the worst mexican food i 've ever had .
not much flavor , runny beans , gross appearance and taste .
i wo n't go back .
wondering how it 's stayed in business for so long .
fish taco had _num_ % cabbage on it n barely any fish .
gave me _num_ % discount .
the single worst dinning experience .
forgot drinks and was rude .
there is a reason why it is empty on a sunday night .
was very very disappointed with this location .
the restaurant was not even half full or busy at all .
our booth was equally gross .
there was hair stuck up in it with food .
_num_ min later we finally got our bottled beers which were lukewarm .
no silverware and then when we got it i had food on my knife .
first time in my life i have n't left a tip .
not to the one on central .
i 've never seen such a filthy and unprofessional restaurant .
swing and miss !
there was n't a second bite .
she also waited at least _num_ minutes before he acknowledged her .
while the food is good , the service was horrible .
the service is just downright mean .
the tortilla soup was way over seasoned - could not eat it .
i have been here twice , year 's apart .
but this burrito was practically swimming with it .
i could n't eat more than half .
my wife got the chimichanga and it quite simply lacked any crunch .
but quite simply , there is no reason to revisit .
$ _num_ wasted and apparently they sent an upgrade !
also the flowers did not look like what i had ordered .
in the picture there are purple flowers which they just left out completely .
she said she would call me back and let me know .
i had a missed call from them later in the day but no voicemail .
i 'm sure i will have to call them back , again .
i do n't think i have ever experienced such crappy customer service .
moral of this story : do not use cactus flowers .
the absolute worse experience i have ever had ordering flowers !
it was awful .
attended the `` graduation '' night after being pressured into going .
just an old embassy suites type hotel at a higher rate .
reading the other reviews , i think their fault lies in their night staff .
bad choice .
he said that this hotel has been the worst in terms of service .
i 'd suggest a lower room , especially in the summer .
unfortunately our room key did n't work .
their shuttle would have taken us there , but they never mentioned it .
_num_ stars for them and _num_ for the night staff .
so disappointed .
no there was no one outside .
again no one there to help .
front desk customer service is horrible and the wifi connection is even worse .
very loud hotel .
i would not recommend this particular hotel .
the wifi is super slow at night .
the wifi at hilton was exactly the opposite .
the service here is horrific !
the pool also never had towels .
nope did n't happen , and they refused to change it .
they did n't even want to try and fix their mistake .
ugh where to begin ?
outdated decor everywhere .
Negative
i would give this place a negative _num_ rating .
was expecting a hilton quality hotel and this was not quite there .
it was advertised as near the airport but it was not .
it had no shuttle to the airport and the area was not that great .
i could smell them cooking bacon in the morning .
maybe someone that eats meat would appreciate this but to me ... yuk !
wo n't be coming back here unfortunately .
they 're getting _num_ stars only for customer service .
the first time , it was n't bad .
it was a little pricey , but the meals were prepared correctly .
the second time , however , was a totally different story .
the second sandwich was another veggie .
i called again and spoke to monica again .
no problem , i 'll just speak to your manager .
i threw it away .
delivery service is ridiculous .
the fries are usually lukewarm .
i received neither .
worst service ever .
i do n't know what all of the excitement is about for aj 's .
this place sucks .
the prices are just stupid .
i also do n't cook a lot .
all this hype for nothing .
_num_ .
this place has no natural foods .
i wasnt expecting whole foods , but really , whats the point ?
_num_ .
_num_ .
why not just go to fry 's or safeway ?
the same exact stuff you get at safeway for more $ .
_num_ corned beef steak remains .
about _num_ pounds .
-- nothing else .
_num_ stars for the awesome beer selection .
a turkey sandwich no mayo i say .
smh ... wont be back .
it was about $ _num_ for a turkey breast meal .
when we tried to heat it up , the heating instructions were no bueno .
the stuffing , gravy , and yams were pretty good .
the meal had three huge turkey breasts that did n't seem cooked very well .
aj 's fine foods did not deliver the quality that i was expecting .
their pastas and deserts are way too overpriced for the quality .
overcooked cold large prawns were so bad i had to return the item .
i , in error , went to the wrong place to check out .
sadly , i am not exaggerating this in anyway .
i was completely appalled by the lack of basic manners .
i am not sure if this was due to new employees or management .
they were both always rude , short , and unpleasant .
every time i said hello to one of the women she never responded .
the last straw for me happened last week .
i went to the deli area to get breakfast .
i greeted one of the deli workers and she again said nothing .
super disappointed with my treatment at the aj 's .
management obviously does n't follow up with complaints properly as well .
the crust was just so tough .
the store was practically dead the whole time i was wandering around .
you wo n't get more money from me aj 's !
avoid this store at all costs in the afternoon .
my friend gave me said flowers because i was having a rough pain day .
they are cheap money hungry people !
its overpriced junk .
they lie to get your money .
this place is dirty and you spend all your money here for lies .
not anymore .
go out of business already ... one bathroom in the whole store .
overpriced junk food .
it 's ridiculous .
basically ruined .
this is not the location to splurge on pricy cuts .
lame .
really bad experience today .
they never displayed the strawberries upon delivery and i feel cheated and frustrated .
aj 's fails at this nearly every time i go .
virtually every time i go there , i have an experience like that .
i 'll be avoiding going back .
one star is too many .
just a warning if you eat here and have allergies .
they hire idiots who lack important knowledge that could kill someone .
i stopped at aj 's twice this week for lunch .
no lettuce , no sprouts , no tomato , no cheese no mustard .
just an insane amount of meat between two slices of bread .
_num_ on the sandwich , total waste of money .
do n't forget to bring your attitude when you shop .
rude is what this place is .
never had customer service like this .
the deli people and the man serving the pizza were down right assholes .
keep your over priced crap and your fake ass employees !
also hoping they would take care of me somehow in this situation .
if anything the manager looked a little annoyed but gave me my money back .
all $ _num_ was n't even discounted .
the bacon was good but the scrambled eggs were terrible !
they were watery and barely edible .
they tasted like powdered eggs and water were mixed in with regular eggs .
i would not eat the scrambled eggs in any form .
yet again this saturday mid afternoon , service is bad .
_num_ people waiting for service at the bakery but only a single employee serving .
_num_ walked away and gave up .
lastly , guys that ringing noise you hear is a phone .
would n't last _num_ minutes in ny .
horrible !
meanwhile , she was standing at the counter playing on her iphone .
bread was stale , salad was n't fresh , pizza was just ok .
i could n't chew them so i sent them back .
when we got our new wings they looked a million times better .
they were golden and smothered in some of the same weird sauce .
my boyfriend ordered a philly i ordered raviolis .
she left it at the table and brought the check about ten minutes later .
who do you think you are charging that much for a horrible eating experience !
just not edible !
the pizza crust is rubber and just strange tasting !
the sauce is filled with sugar , and it was runny !
watery and not filled with goodness .
toppings were not fresh at all .
i love me some broasted chicken , so in i went to investigate .
streets of ny pizza was mediocre .
i was disappointed .
it was $ _num_ per topping .
my pizza was over $ _num_ .
the staff before him said i could only have one pizza .
um , wtf ?
they just lost my business .
not cool !
took another _num_ minutes for appetizers and first drink refills .
soggy , and no sauce .
... however sometimes you get what you pay for .
although the price was right , the pizza was not .
if i could i 'd give zero stars !
i ordered _num_ hours ago and the food just barely got here .
very disappointed and will never order again !
it was one of the worst dinning experiences we have ever had .
this is the second time i have had a problem at this store .
the first round of drinks was fine .
but we had to be rather obvious to get refills .
the antipasto was okay but not worth the cost .
the italian beef sandwich was awful .
the little bread appetizers was a plus .
i did not like the soup .
we stopped in last night after driving around trying to find a place .
pasta was cold cheese was n't even melted on top .
pizza was hard and yuck !
worst place ever .
ordered once and got really old chicken and fries .
plus half of the order was missing .
dont waste your money here .
their food is old and disgusting !
the wings were gross .
the sauce was weird and definitely not traditional hot wing sauce .
the wings were dry and overlooked .
ick food .
my suggesting here , is not to order the individual slices .
it wo n't happen .
in my case it did n't matter because my slices went into the trash .
just thought we would give it another try .
zero stars should really be an option .
after _num_ yrs i can not support this kind of company .
we left , with a hungry child and went elsewhere .
taste was just fair .
wings were cold .
customer service was horrible .
they said i had _num_ minute and they could not wait for me .
as i told them i did n't even need to come in .
they refused .
customer service is horrible here .
this was unacceptable .
it 's a sad thing when taco bell is better than something .
i do n't remember if he actually got his food first .
when we got our food , it was awful .
probably the worst mexican food i ever had .
i had a chicken burrito that was filled with bland rice and tasteless chicken .
mom had a ground turkey burrito and asked me where the turkey was .
why does n't del taco take a cue from pollo loco ?
i 've never had a bad meal at pollo loco .
this del taco even makes taco bell seem like four star dining !
the service at this location was terrible !
he was very curt with us and rushed through the transaction .
more like mediocre burrito !
no such luck .
it 's one thing to be too busy to take orders or help customers .
it 's another thing entirely to be so rude and unprofessional .
closed up lights off .
it 's fucking stupid !
and no one wants broken tacos !
stopped in for a few tacos and found out they were _num_ cents now !
remember when they were _num_ , _num_ cents ?
i receive them , and they 're skimpy like taco bell !
only a last resort .
this place just did n't do it for me .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
waited _num_ minutes in a crowded room with weird people .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
threw half of it away and was pissed because i paid so much .
_num_ .
i 'm not really sue why this place gets great reviews .
first there is no place to sit inside at all .
seating is not available at typical eating times and lines may be long .
there 's no option for fountain drinks or even local bottled water .
third , the service sucks .
fifth and finally , the bread is hard to eat .
there are no silverware to save you from the embarrassment of using your hands .
i have to copy stephanie b 's review below .
i do n't know stephanie b but what she said is dead on .
i could n't agree more .
first there is no place to sit inside at all .

third , the service sucks .
fifth and finally , the bread is hard to eat .
there are no silverware to save you from the embarrassment of using your hands .
kind of pricey for a plain sandwich , no drink etc .
this was would be a nice side salad , not a lunch .
so a hit and a two misses .
ok , uh , what ?
she said they could n't do that .
it 's unfortunate their menu only has _num_ sandwiches on it .
they market themselves as a sandwich shop but i just do n't buy it .
but , recently they seem to have quality control issues .
a second issue has been seasoning , which used to be perfect .
yikes , this is not customer service of any kind .
not the savory taste i 'm looking for with a chicken salad sandwich .
so , we had similarly high expectations for the pane bianco cafe .
we were disappointed .
if we were n't starving , we would 've gone elsewhere .
not kid friendly !
looking over the menu , i noticed the kids menu was slim to none .
the decor is painfully cute .
why not just make something that tastes good ?
the chicken was good but there was n't much of it .
but i wo n't be doing it again .
whenever i get to phoenix , i always stop by for some bread .
the young girl behind the counter told me they were n't open until _num_ .
she again told me no .
she again told me no .
went for dinner on a tuesday at _num_ pm ( july _num_ ) .
drove _num_ minutes to have a meal here .
waste of my time to try a new place .
however , the service was so bad , i wo n't be back .
ummmm that 's weird , but fine .
_num_ mins later , we are done eating .
not cool .
this place is foul .
a recent lunch with _num_ colleagues was disappointing in terms of service and food .
overall , a disappointing experience .
huge , let me repeat this , huge mistake !
that was a completely wasted lunch for me .
disappointing & unfriendly staff .
the sandwiches are alright , however there are no sides or chips .
they should stick to pizza !
i ordered the monday sandwich of the day and a pizza for my son .
low value , mediocre food and bad service equals no thanks .
the food was cold .
i had soggy french toast .
they had a container that was yellow like butter but looked like oil .
the chai tea was lukewarm but tasted okay .
the hash browns were shredded potatoes , they were n't crispy .
it was unremarkable .
the meat was salty and tasteless .
very expensive for a bowl of soup just over $ _num_ .
also the very small potato chips for the kettle bag is $ _num_ .
i 'm not sure when or if i 'll be back again , personally .
i 'm being generous - they do n't deserve the star .
i sat down at a table .
i simply got up and walked out .
when i go to a restaurant , i do not beg for service .
i visited g & d during the light rail pub crawl .
when we walked in , my crew headed straight to the bar .
then i had to yell to her that we were ready .
did she just not want our money that day ?
i was starving so i 'm not sure about authenticity or flavor .
i 'll try that if i ever visit g & d again .
it 's at minimum a heavy vinegar / buffalo sauce , thai chilis ?
for this and the cider alone i 'm returning .
this took the _num_ to a _num_ .
that and it did n't come with the horseradish on the menu .
the entrance is a little confusing being on the south side of the building .
unfortunately , the food is not so great .
i 'm not sure what was up with that .
this place just is n't good enough .
hair in food is just plain gross .
on another night , the scotch eggs followed the same theme .
beer selection was good , but food was terrible .
the food was not good and actually made me and my friend very sick .
i really wanted to like this place but it just was n't good .
i could not believe this bar served food .
nothing about it said restaurant .
there was a waitress wandering around that looked just as lost as we did .
could i have asked for our server ?
what a waste of time !
i 've only been here once and it was ok .
steak 'n kidney pie = where was the kidney ?
!
g & d was a sad day for me .
menu for food was quite typical .
i personally do n't get what draws people to this place .
Negative
it 's got a bit of a negative vibe .
the staff is not friendly or service oriented and it 's dirty .
recently i have noticed a big down turn in the staff at this pub .
my last visit was months ago and i could n't wait to leave .
it 's just not fun anymore .
so long , george .
as i could see there was one bartender and one waitress .
we could n't get a drink or even order food .
it 's a dark bar , my date liked the english vibe of it .
i 've just been to better karaoke bars ( i.e .
it tasted like weak kool-aid .
`` d '' : said even his beer was n't good .
i feel like all their drinks are super watered down .
however we also ordered food , cause i was starving .
i just do n't see the appeal of the place .
i would rather spend my money elsewhere .
there were maybe _num_ or _num_ occupied tables -- it was n't busy .
_num_ servers were present as well as a blonde bartender who totally ignored us .
before we could ask for waters our server ran away .
no flavor and the condiments that came with the burger were the standard fare .
the steak fries as a side should have stayed in the kitchen .
our wait staff was non existent .
she never bothered to check on us once .
it tasted like water before .
any liquor drinks taste like watered down juice .
and they are n't cheap drinks , so that 's ridiculous .
would have given it zero stars .
the waitress was awful .
to add insult to the visit , i got food poisoning !
i would n't recommend this place at all ... .
but the service was inexcusable .
for an english pub the fish and chips were average at best .
the service was very poor because they were too busy and had little staff .
unfortunately , that did n't happen and we ended up leaving .
unfortunately , it 's not pleasant .
it 's almost like they do n't give a crap about the restaurant tables .
the burger ordered was just okay , but i could n't help feeling awkward .
wo n't be back .
on a busier night , we could n't get service to save our lives .
but time has not been kind to this place .
we walked out , and warned other patrons going in .
avoid this place .
terrible service .
unfortunately it was a huge let down .
that we were here there were several tables that never got cleared .
there certainly were a lot of regulars ( not ordering food ... ) .
this place is dirty , the owner is miserable and the food is terrible .
i just do n't get it .
such a shame .
i want to select zero stars but this app wo n't let me .
do not waste time nor money on this place .
the owner is simply terrible and the food is worse .
the place is noisy and dirty .
owner is one angry nasty person .
this place is worse than terrible .
the food is equally terrible .
there are just too many good places to waste time and money here .
i used to like this place as my hang out on friday nights .
i refused because it was not my drinks .
i 'm horrified by the way i got treated this morning .
the said no we do n't know what your talking about .
i said , you ca n't give us water from the tap .
they treated us so bad i would never ever go there to eat .
that 's not how to work with the community .
plus the place was a mess and they had just open .
shame on you racist workers for treating us like that .
stopped by last for dinner while on a biz trip to phoenix .
i commented that his menu was misleading and he 's taking advantage of people .
he walked away no apology no `` thank you for your business . ''
sadly , the george and dragon is n't what it used to be .
they were inedible - overcooked to death and hard as a rock .
the only thing edible on her plate were the chips ( french fries ) .
i ca n't order from the bar .
the server refused to serve me because the barista had my card .
she would n't even bring me my card .
let me get up , go to the bar and wait .
because why would i want to cone back to this .
the hostess did n't even know what the beers were .
wo n't be back .
not only this visit , several past visits .
servers too busy chatting , hiding , you name it .
bartender is extremely slow to prepare drinks .
did i mention there were only _num_ patrons .
seems like management is non existent .
too bad .
even then it was n't all that great .
rude .
probably will not be back .
george and dragon sucks .
no wonder the place was a ghost town and smells like garbage !
the staff was not helpful and in fact turned out to be extremely rude .
she made no effort to correct this gross service .
this is a dangerous and unhelpful bar and grill in my experience .
if i could give less i would .
the food is somehow worse than before ?
the butt end and that was it .
the french fries were awful .
i never in a million years thought they could make the food worse .
i feel bad for the waitresses .
i 'm actually kinda sad about it because my hopes were pretty high .
fire your entire kitchen staff and start over , or just stop serving food .
wish i could give no stars on this one .
i do n't even know where to start with this bad experience .
our food did n't arrive for _num_ mins .
and overall the food sucked .
she does n't get our checks to us for about _num_ mins .
she still got it wrong .
and shows no effort to take it off of my bill .
she was just getting everything wrong .
she somehow has lost his card .
so overall , my experience here was a nightmare .
you will never catch me in that place again .
could a fooled me !
food was pretty good and the beer was cold but service really was bad .
make this an unappealing place to hang out .
most miserable worst experience ever .
looking forward to going here for weeks , big let down .
mashed potatoes and cold bits of hamburger .
the manager would n't even assist when we asked for our tab .
ridiculous .
this place will not earn our business again .
as far as dive bars go , this one is pretty bad .
they have the worst service i 've ever seen in a pub .
their food is n't much better .
they are consistency awful .
it was a huge portion of bland food .
would not recommend .
fianc had a bland burger , although the fries were tasty .
sad thing is the service is worse than before .
waitress brought out a drink with water and ice .
she really though scotch comes on the rocks by default .
really does n't matter .
i 'm not coming back .
damn shame .
a bit disappointed .
sunday noon , about _num_ patrons .
no one seemed to be in a hurry to wait on customers .
beer was chilled , not cold .
took about _num_ minutes to get potato skins after we placed our order .
there was no issue with that .
the reason why they get only _num_ stars is for poor customer service .
very disappointed .
never come to take an order .
he said he could get it done within a week , no problem .
so , i gave him the job .
long story short ... this went on for over two weeks !
very frustrating to say the least !
i said nothing and walked .
.
these people are idiots .
places like this seem to have a really difficult staffing problem .
instead i would have to pay $ _num_ for the additional small box .
horrible service , horrible attitudes .
it was very disappointing .
awkward and slow .
you then never refund my money and i never get my package delivered .
that 's worst case but even then it could get worse !
just went here to discuss getting some items printed .
do not past go , do not give your $ _num_ .
but you know why we could n't do the copies ourselves ?
just absolutely frustrating .
i would not recommend this office at all .
i hardly trusted them to give it another go .
my stylist greeted me and immediately complemented me on my necklace .
her assistant immediately complemented me on my boring skirt .
when i paid for my mediocre cut the girl complemented me on my ring .
the end result is nothing like the pictures and is very dull and plain .
i could have saved myself $ _num_ and gone to super cuts .
i would not recommend this salon unless you know the specific hair dresser .
the cut was crooked and the layers where a mess .
i would stay away from this place unless you know specific hairdresser .
i assume it is to get you hooked and come back .
not happening .
the girls were nice but my make up sucked .
i would not recommend this place .
the cigars did n't draw well and were generally not very good .
we wo n't be going back .
recently visited modern lighting , and would never purchase from that store .
nothing broke nor even fell over .
i recomend no one shop here .
horrible business ethics all around .
no thanks .
upon entering we were greeted by a friendly `` no drinks allowed ! ''
really now , get over yourself .
he is rude and arrogant .
there 's too much junk otherwise .
needless to say , i will not be going back .
this man ( the owner ) does n't even deserve to be in business .
he needs to put the lamp shade on and turn on the light !
incredibly poor , aweful service .
he does n't even deserve _num_ star .
i wish i could give him no stars .
treats grown ups like little children .
if i 'm not his target customer , who the hell is ?
yikes , run !
how disappointing .
wow i wish i had read these reviews before walking into this store .
wish i could give this place less than _num_ star .
i wish i can give zero stars .
when i asked why owner said because is my store .
i am never going back or buying there .
do n't waste your time .
the owner of this store deserves no stars !
i do not understand how he stays in business .
guess what , he threw him out too , lol .
this man is a real joke , do not even attempt to shop there .
`` i 'm sorry , we do n't do counter checks . ''
you are a bank and do n't even carry $ _num_ .
on top of the awful stench , the teacher sucked .
it 's unfortunate the hygiene was n't up to par .
it 's bad for bikram and damn , it 's really inconvenient for me .
i desperately missed my down dogs .
i 'm disappointed .
my former studio definitely had a smell but it was nothing like this .
_num_ students new to bikram were allowed to practice in the front row .
_num_ .
this place does not even deserve a one star !
so rude !
because apparently , you need to know all the bikram .
horrible .
sick .
this place simply nasty .
honestly , made me sick .
i would never suggest this place to anyone .
smelly , moldy and just plain gross !
i 'm sure there are better places to try in town !
the yoga studio smelled like sweaty socks , it was unbearable !
this time i was being charge $ _num_ ?
they tried calling a number that i never gave them .
he then walks off .
is he going to call me , should i call him ?
but he wo n't let me talk to anyone else .
stay far far away !
this place is an absolute joke .
avoid this place at all costs !
take the time to put tape on your box before dropping off !
i do n't keep packing tape at home because i do n't ship much .
it 's pretty rotten of them to charge a whole dollar for it .
if not , i will use my own strip of tape .
this store lost my package .
they were nice though .
poor customer service for the owner !
i checked my po box and no package .
so i left .
everyone ( including eric , the owner ) were friendly and helpful .
he said there was nothing wrong with the bike .
he said it was the way i rode it .
i wore my station hat in the pig .
eric became all sorts of friendly and helpful .
the service sucks at the pig .
buy your bike else where , like tempe bikes .
no problem , they said have it ready in two days .
a week after that and it was not done .
another _num_ weeks after that and it was not done .
the brake pads perhaps , they were different , but the tube ?
that was disappointing .
it seems like a cool place , but this was really a bad experience .
two stars for their work , zero for service .
i meant to add this just after i wrote the entry .
it was true for the whole short week since i purchased it from walmart .
i get it , you 're busy .
the point is , that when i went there , they started from scratch .
so i 've been to every bike shop in town .
my first experience with the pig was trying to buy a high-end mountain bike .
but back to the pig .
i gave him the shock and it was sent in to fox .
fox called the shop and told them my shock was no longer available .
eric again was not willing to help .
needless to say , i will never be going back to this shop again .
i am very disappointed and will spread the word about this terrible bike shop .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
this review is no different .
if they had provided those answers , they would have made a sale .
in the past _num_ weeks , i stopped by the shop _num_ times .
unbelievable .
ignore me once , shame on you .
ignore me twice , shame on me .
ignore me three times , get _num_ star on yelp .
bottom line , i do n't recommend this place .
bang bang bang bang !
out the door , $ _num_ for repairs .
customer service very , very poor !
not so !
we spoke with the owner eric and he said that was not true .
if you want to be treated like sh*t , this is the place .
i certainly will not patronize this place again .
terrible !
tried asking questions to get more information and refused to help .
the service sucked as my server struggled to refill my soda just once .
not because i thought it had potential or was even that hungry .
if you can help it , avoid ordering the sausage .
in fact , if it 's not made of eggs , do n't bother .
they wo n't make it right .
and do n't bother complaining to the manager .
dude probably does n't even know what eggs benedict is supposed to look like .
hubby insisted we had eaten here before .
the oreo pancake is sadly the best thing on the table .
i am not a fan of it in my home nor in restaurants .
i ordered the taco salad for my lunch .
what a disappointment !
this salad was not worth $ _num_ .
all in all , i wo n't come back here .
we left full , the food run of the mill .
needless to say , i wo n't be back .
i simply pushed my plate away , finished the meeting , paid my bill .
the staff all seems to be in some other world though .
the service is consistently bad , slow , and inattentive .
eating out with a small child is a nightmare here .
good food , poor service .
but today it should have been called suck eggs .
the service is ok but the food was terrible !
i had eggs benedict and i was greatly disappointed !
Neutral
i 'm giving one star , because there is no negative star .
it 's _num_ , time update your menu & restaurant .
he comes back with cream , no napkins .
that 's no big deal , i do n't care .
friend _num_ had an even more crispy looking omelet .
friend _num_ got a turkey sandwich .
it was dry , and lacking in well ... turkey !
check your cold storage bins people !
friend _num_ has a major strawberry allergy .
as a former employee of this location , i 'm sorely disappointed .
boy was i wrong .
the food was bland and not good at all .
i could n't even finish my meal it was that bad .
how disappointing .
the food is bland and unhealthy .
the price is cheap but not a bargain .
the service is mediocre to poor .
no surprise .
service sucked .
then the waitress just continued to disappear over and over again .
if we needed anything ... ketchup , fork , check , etc forget it .
my gf decided french toast was fine .
no info on the ingredients .
i point out that there 's no info on that sheet either .
he 's super pissed at this point .
i tell him to go away and get me someone else to help .
i stopped in there hoping maybe i would have better luck .
to make a long story short , they got it wrong .
basically told me i was s out of luck .
very unfortunate customer service .
this was not a custom mix either .
now i remember why we switched to home depot paint .
`` nobody 's ever ordered one of those here before . ''
and even that was n't good .
after waiting half an hour i requested a refund .
they did refund my money .
in our time there perhaps there were _num_ patrons , including us .
the soda ( self serve ) was nothing to write about .
just do n't go there to eat .
garbage .
there the guy at the counter told me they did n't have my pictures .
apparently my order was n't anywhere in their system .
alright , whatever .
he does n't .
i grab them , and ask where my candy is .
i did n't care .
i would n't be writing this review if that was it .
so they ca n't blame it on remodeling confusion .
they are just dumb .
and if i were reviewing just the store i would say it was fantastic .
he let out another sigh .
skip this place and make an appointment somewhere else !
feel free to take your money elsewhere . ''
i 'm sick of waiting here and eating my time for my prescriptions .
i am taking my business elsewhere .
so i get hung up again .
then i asked for the store manager , which was already standing behind me .
says there 's nothing he can do .
these days want a paycheck but do n't want to work for it !
in september of _num_ my vehicle was damaged by a tree in their property .
not that great in volleyball .
aaron brothers we 're overpriced mart .
aaron brothers you 'll never see thomas s. again mart .
aaron brothers got your ass yelped on yelp mart .
i purchased a _num_ x _num_ print recently that i planned on framing .
she informed me that it could be ready july 30th , exactly one month .
how the hell do they stay in business ?
i did notice that there were two employees present and one customer , me .
no surprises there .
avoid this place !
the service was horrible !
this place needs better service .
the owner commented , and is still rude and lying in her comments .
she invited me in her comment to try another salon .
no thanks .
worst customer service ever .
she spoke to me as if i were below her .
i have never been treated so poorly in my life .
they soooo so rudely brought me in back to the room .
and then told me i didnt know what i was talking about .
such a rude rude rude woman .
is n't that what they signed up for ?
i 'm sorry , but i am more than just two parts !
my sister was treated so rude .
and my god was i disappointed .
i highly recommend you skip wendy 's for breakfast .
they towed my car today because i did not eat in the restaurant .
now have to wait until monday to get my car .
wendy 's of _num_ e indian school , i hope you read this .
my kudos to that poor woman .
i timed it and once again i waited over _num_ minutes for my food .
i have no hesitation in giving this review one star .
will not be back to this location .
so incredibly gross .
so gross .
gross .
do n't go here , for the love of god !
this place has gone downhill .
every time i go here , i order the same thing .
every time i get the wrong items .
i 'm getting real tired of it .
it 's seriously not that hard .
it really was n't busy .
what i got was _num_ sandwiches no cheese and all of them had lettuce .
this is getting ridiculous .
so i 'm at wendy 's only because i saw an ad on tv .
yes i know the food never looks like it does in the commercials .
but they have baked potatoes .
what other fast food joint has baked potatoes ?
i drove out of my way just to get me some baked potato !
they 're out of baked potatoes .
`` now that 's just stupid '' as stupid as running out of potatoes .
this place do n't even service there restrooms often like other places .
the ghost pepper fries is a waste of money if you like spicy food .
not spicy at all .
asked the cashier again , she said she would talked to the manager .
well my hour lunch is over so i 'll find somewhere else to go .
this was a total disappointment .
i would give it no stars if i could .
i went there saturday , bit into a burger and it tasted like fish .
the management was none too concerned .
there is almost a screw up every time .
but wait ... did you call the desk after talking to the dr ?
uh , do n't you know that is your job ?
after me and my husband waited for _num_ months to get our initial appt .
the coordinator for phoenix va should be ashamed .
what a nightmare !
it does however take me awhile to get an appointment .
frankly this is a disgusting way to treat our vets .
( make that _num_ minutes ... .
are these the kind of employees the phoenix va have as support staff ?
worst customer service ever !
still no treatment or diagnosis as to what is going on .
it 's _num_ months between appointments .
my needs were not for a cold or a cut finger .
i think that is a shame in itself .
this review honestly does n't include the va 's er department .
and nobody else will , '' ( lie number _num_ ) .
i 've never been to a worse medical facility in my life .
you should be fucking embarrassed of yourselves .
this place is an absolute joke .
from _num_ to _num_ , i waited to check in .
the blood draw itself took under _num_ seconds total .
i accepted this appointment , having no other choice .
having no other choice i accepted this new appointment .
`` drug them up and send them home '' should be the motto .
no actual health care being done anymore !
such a shame we ca n't even trust our own health care system !
the parking is ridiculous .
i drove around for an hour to avoid valet parking still nothing .
then finally had to use valet just to wait another hour .
the doctors and staff can be rude and non caring .
this place really need to be more organized .
i wasted a half tank of gas just trying to find parking .
a week later i get a call to bring the copies .
a week later i get a call to come in and discuss it .
this place has a bad reputation for a reason .
if you have the ability , avoid them like the plague .
however the va system cant provide the medical care that i need .
he was very thorough and was constantly typing while asking me questions .
slight language barrier , i think he is of russian descent .
he got everything wrong and i had to correct him !
a mistake here would definitely cause some serious problems !
_num_ weeks later .
my thumbs are tired so i 'll quit for now .
i forgive them but it 's just unacceptable to mess up more than twice .
the doctors & nurses are wonderful but out biggest complaint is the scheduling .
pros : the corn bread , green beans , and creamed spinach were delicious .
that is totally unacceptable !
fast food salad , pasta and pizza .
the salad was your standard plate of bland greens .
despite the high convenience factor , i will not be back .
for years , i had passed by but was never impressed by their menu .
pasta items are in the $ _num_ range + $ _num_ for chicken .
went there for lunch and had a chicken chopped salad .
there was not a lot of chicken and it was not cheap !
as i was walking up ( after 1:30 ) i saw their specials .
or maybe i just had my taste buds set for lemon chicken .
it also cost more than it should .
the staff was friendly , i mean at least they smiled .
car stuff 's expensive .
the autozone kid was super helpful though .
autozone has recently changed their battery testing policy and equipment .
came across a very terrible worker here .
could not help me for nothing .
lazy lazy lazy !
this store is no longer open .
it 's completely empty and nobody is answering the phone or emails either .
no , thanks .
the poor wait staff .
and the food is just not good .
the budget did n't include morton 's or ruth 's chris .
ok , ok , ok , too much of the extras .
the clientele was like a scene out of dawn of the dead .
skip the entrees .
my fav 's were the spinach dip and the wings .
the chips tasted freshly made but were a little greasy for my liking .
so , i ate there on wednesday and it is now friday .
next time i visit phoenix this will not be where i go .
waited _num_ min .
walked out after _num_ more min and no sign of server or salads ... .
i was very disappointed to say the least .
host was not very personable , but we gave it a chance .
wrong idea .
we waited _num_ min , not even a greet or anything .
we seen all sorts of servers walk by our table , ignoring us .
will never i back .
their quesadilla burger gave me food poisoning .
wait time , well _num_ min .
horrible .
unable to eat .
left without eating .
just horrible .
terrible service sitting at the bar for happy hour .
unfortunately tonight 's visit was far from superb as we are used to .
she responded with , `` i was not aware of that request . ''
he turned my experience around for such an awful beginning .
i 've never had such filthy food via delivery before .
add insult to injury they did n't even include my side of veggies .
worst experience !
not coming back to this particular applebees .
wait was terrible on a late thursday night .
finally seated , _num_ mins before they took our order .
food came out , cold and or overcooked .
only good thing was our waiter , he was doing his best .
will not be returning with all the late night choices down central .
last i checked i 'm pretty sure that was the servers job .
the entrees are not that great .
i have ordered a steak and pasta here before and they 're nothing special .
the food is n't worth that kind of treatment .
food was disgusting .
there was not enough people on the floor to help the server out .
was not happy with the food !
on july 2nd , _num_ , we visited this applebee 's .
he brought us _num_ napkins & _num_ forks .
that is unacceptable .
very disappointing & a terrible experience .
once seated , we then wait for our waiter to arrive .
my girlfriend asked to substitute the broccoli with mushrooms and add grilled onions .
looked strange at first but whatever we went with it , we were hungry .
next time attempt to act like you care .
none have ever been great .
stood around for at least _num_ minutes before we were seated .
she was no where to be seen for several minutes .
it tasted bad .
she just wrote down the wrong thing .
our meal was ruined .
this is the worst applebee 's ever .
staff was friendly , restaurant was moderately clean .
after much discussion they cooked another egg .
i wo n't be back .
it took very long to have drinks ordered after being sat .
this place is ridiculous .
servers gave us a pissed off look when we did .
meals came back looking under the heat lamp sad and limp .
meal was overall gross !
too many other good restaurants in phoenix .
except mine was wrong and i ask for the right entree .
the waitress seem irritated that i just did n't take what she brought me .
no one ever apologized at all .
they tried to make it seem like it was our fault .
i will never step foot in that restaurant again and will contact corporate .
it was absolutely horrible burger and even more horrible experience .
no stars for food or location of central and camelback !
drove _num_ minutes out to come to applebee 's .
went here again and they were closed _num_ minutes early .
it 's unacceptable .
i was very disappointed in the quality of food !
there 's a _num_ , _num_ , and _num_ ? ''
_num_ percent chance this is me .
i ca n't stand castle boutique .
it 's terrible .
stopped in here a few months back .
why does phoenix not have better sex toy stores ?
unfortunately , this location has gone downhill over the years .
staff seems a bit apathetic .
one left to ring a customer up and came back .
`` , which as a side note i thought was somewhat rude .
you ca n't even give me a `` hello .
i was waiting on you .
i went to cheese 'n stuff to buy cheese and the choices were laughable .
it 's not even a cheese shop .
the first thing i noticed when i walked into the place was the smell .
there were no specialty cheeses or meats .
one of the deli cases actually just had chips in it .
do n't understand the high rating this restaurant is getting ?
well folks , you yelpers here are totally fooled !
it 's not !
for starters , my friend and i ordered sizzling rice soup .
both dishes were supposed to be hot ... not !
it was very meh .
it was very bland .
the rice was n't cooked well at all ... seriously , wtf ?
the soup that came out beforehand was nothing to write home about .
if i could give china chili less than one star , i would .
but you 're better off going elsewhere if you want good chinese food .
that 's a definite sign that the quality is sub-par .
a lot of people from work seem to like to go here .
after being there several times i still dont get what the fuss is .
as far as taste goes , i have had better .
really not sure what the fuss is about .
i 'm only half asian so i 'm not sure if my opinion counts .
the menu is standard for a chinese restaurant nothing special .
the beef was chewy and the chow mein was bland .
i do not understand why people love china chili .
i would n't recommend this restaurant to my worst enemy !
i ordered the orange chicken , fried rice , soup , and crab puffs .
i wo n't be coming back .
over priced mediocre food .
i was dissatisfied with this place after reading all the rave reviews .
pork fried rice , lemon chicken , and sweet and sour chicken .
chewy flavorless pork and little rice rocks were in abundance .
it really had no flavor at all .
it is hard to mess up this dish , but somehow , they did .
sweet and sour chicken .
food is typical of phoenix chinese food , very boring .
after everything i 'd heard of the place , i was expecting alot more .
will not be back .
i have eaten in restaurant only a handful of times .
the service is friendly but lacking .
the vegetables are always overcooked , mushy and taste oily .
that is not good chinese food .
not sure i will be back , possibly for lunch for the orange chicken .
my first review of china chili was _num_ stars .
after today 's experience i am down to _num_ star .
i had kung pao chicken and my wife had lemon chicken .
i like it spicey but this was just sour .
nasty !
another disappointment .
within hours , i suffered severe symptoms of food poisoning .
this is direct cause and effect .
meantime there is no way i would ever return .
the prawns were good but nothing special .
i only ate _num_ or _num_ bites .
the sesame chicken was the same way .
some of the ladies who were waitresses there , however , were not friendly .
bland taste for what this restaurant 's reputation has in the neighborhood .
i was not impressed at all .
i had sweet and sour chicken , pork fried rice and wonton soup .
nothing to write home about .
it did n't wow me .
oh no no no no !
i will not be back !
i ordered the teriyaki chicken spicy and the crab puffs .
the taste of the chicken was gross .
i thought at one point i may have gotten duck or something .
not good at all .
the crab puffs were awesome .
i will not be returning though .
the food is underwhelming !
i told my husband at the end to tell the staff they lack beef .
just the worst chinese food ever .
lacks in flavor regardless of dish and the meat was just suspect .
you will be disappointed that you did n't listen .
pretty disappointed after reading other reviews .
overpriced chinese food and only tasted mediocre at most .
we never got enough silverware or soup bowls .
i also told her the soup was cold .
this was not the first time i 've had a complaint with china chile .
they always have an excuse !
i will never spend another dollar in that establishment .
the atmosphere makes you feel cheap and cheated .
so i only ate half of each .
food was horrible .
we got a fried rice , which was not too bad .
we returned the beef because it was not edible .
they get five star 's it was the food .
first there was no crab in the crab cheese puffs , just cream cheese .
nothing i would order again its clear they have a loyal customer base .
it may take another try , but for me that wont be anytime soon .
we ordered _num_ different dishes and from ordering to delivery was 5-7 minutes literally .
a water refill should n't take longer then preparing _num_ dishes .
walked out when i realized they put msg in their food .
rather get of pf changs or pei wei .
even panda express does n't use msg .
it 's bad stuff .
i have no idea why this place is so highly rated .
sat for _num_ minutes and flagged someone for an order .
soup for the lunch specials came out after the food , was n't good .
i do n't know what it was but it was awful .
however , the food was very bland .
even the egg rolls were bland .
watered down sauce .
unfortunately i can not recommend this restaurant .
something has changed big time !
find a better florist , they 're out there .
will not be using them again .
they were awful .
there is a huge lack in management here .
these are just plan bad .
the baked goods section is full of wraps , pretzels , etc .
i just paid $ _num_ for two drinks .
the kale is n't fresh it 's frozen .
the drinks are good but not worth the price .
no greeting ... nothing .
no offer to help .
i will urge anyone i know to stay away .
they then price them up using various price guides .
now -- records in pretty bad shape and prices way too high .
not much love for music just about making money .
all i know is that this place smells like old tuna .
the cheap kind .
i do n't care if it 's inconsistent , but just be nice .
i just want my dive bars to have some life .
average drink prices these days , nothing special .
the first thing we noticed was that there were n't any dishes .
it was amazingly gross .
i 'm never going back to this location again .
after coming here a week ago , we found that it has gotten worse .
this used to be my daughter 's favorite restaurant .
now , she does n't even want to come here again .
i have noticed the trend in all the location but today was the worst .
i took one and it was cold and soggy .
the frozen desert , chocolate , had no taste at all .
it was cold , creamy and without any flavoring .
i will not be returning .
the salad bar lacked all kinds of meat for the salads .
is n't it a buffet ?
lost their lease , building to be torn down .
these guys have no class what so ever .
they made a big issue out of nothing .
these guys are the terrible !
these guys will never admit to any wrong doing for the sake of anything .
you can almost feel how damn fake they really are !
the worst ever !
so , i figured i would try it .
it was almost embarrassing being the only asian person in the place .
i 'm really torn on the number of stars this rating should be .
we did n't go inside , so i ca n't really judge the place .
i hate egg rolls but i would order one of those again .
my orange chicken , however , was tough and rubbery .
we went through the drive-thru around 8pm last wednesday .
both bowls and gyoza came to $ _num_ with tax .
veggies and chicken were okay too .
i guess the whole bowl was just okay .
the sauce served with them were good though .
all in all , not my dream dinner , but just okay .
it 's plain white rice with teriyaki sauce and some disgusting bits of chicken .
this is a $ _num_ bowl of disgusting crap .
i do n't care .
it comes out to about $ _num_ per bowl .
unable to complete simple orders .
i do n't see how i could possibly trust their food safety .
there was almost no teriyaki sauce on my meal first of all .
secondly the rice was not well cooked .
horrible !
i 'm still not sure what a spent $ _num_ on .
over that time the service has declined tremendously .
( referring to a veggie sushi roll item ) .
and the cashier just stood there trying not to laugh !
of course i drove off in a fit and hungry haha .
`` , but the manager said they were not doing anymore today .
i looked at the employee and she just shrugged .
digging into the teriyaki chicken i found a lot of vegetables and little chicken .
this low grade dog food would n't even cut it for a discount special .
ordered _num_ chicken teriyaki bowls and one salad at drive through .
not reputable business .
then again , i wouldnt really consider this a reputable business .
they hardly speak english , and i felt an icy discomfort upon entering .
they had no interest in talking to any of their clients .
the haircut was expensive for a barber shop and not good .
bad idea .
bad business .
i was then appalled to hear that my haircut cost $ _num_ !
what the hell ?
do n't get the old blond lady !
well no wonder her chair was empty , she 's a horrible barber !
hair was cut uneven everywhere , if there was any hair left !
nope , i 'm not going back !
they lost my lunch business for today .
very limited seating .
my only concern was how well they cleaned the blizzard machine .
just looked like it needed some cleaning .
no one got sick so probably fine too .
i find this very strange and annoying .
it is small and seating is limited but that never really bothered me .
i gave him my credit card and he ran it .
i guess they just have a slow credit card machine .
i am disgusted with the restaurant !
they were rather rude regarding their poor flower selection and life of their flowers .
it was n't particularly busy , maybe about ten people all up .
walked around .
put down papers .
talked to someone else .
wo n't be back .
it is like i am a joke to them .
i dont pay that much money for someone not to do their job .
dont consider it .
you will be very dissapointed and your needs will not be met .
what morons , for _num_ months they continued to send mail there .
worse property management company i have encountered !
very unhappy with both .
for _num_ years never one complaint .
he is still not satisfied .
get a better vendor .
if i could leave _num_ stars i would .
worst hoa i have ever had .
they ding you again with another _num_ dollar online payment fee !
update your technology and your slow unhelpful staff .
in my opinion this company does not care about our home values .
very weak management company in my opinion .
for about _num_ pieces of pepper and onion .
hard times , qdoba ?
i need some now .
i was one of only _num_ customers to come in the whole time .
when i pay i ask why they are so slow .
she says they have been slow all day .
you would think if they were slow all day the place would be spotless .
fail !
you barely get the _num_ stars because the burrito was good .
i do n't eat meat or pork , so i only wanted chicken .
no restaurant should ever run out of something like chicken !
automatic low rating .
because i had never been there , i was looking over their menu .
for a restaurant that did n't seem busy at all i would expect cleanliness .
i am going to stick with chipotle all the way .
my first experience with this restaurant will be the only one .
was located near starbucks but no longer there .
the bagels and cream cheese were good , but not outstanding .
Negative
the real negative for me was the restroom .
however , that is not their problem .
their business practices are awful .
i am _num_ for _num_ .
first time shame on them , second time shame on me for going back .
ripoff !
bad business !
i went back another time and it still was n't ready .
terrible service and no apology for the fact they they totally dropped the ball .
i was in the place _num_ minutes and was not greeted once .
ok , way out of my price range .
very disappointed with our purchase and the service we received afterwards .
they were slow to get back to us so we went into the store .
not ethical in my books .
there still is n't an answer .
not to mention yogurt etc .
really hurt by the experience .
neither the staff nor the doctors seemed to genuinely care about the animals .
pathetic !
there is no `` exam '' , just a scam for more money .
the only good thing about this visit was the receptionist .
then why did i pay $ _num_ ?
why should i pay you to research potential problems online ?
this was not the vet i have seen in the past .
complete waste of time any money !
seriously i want my $ _num_ back .
_num_ stars .
borderline _num_ .
i just was n't impressed .
i thought for sure this would become my home away from home .
probably not .
i wanted to sit in the den , where the brews are crafted .
hardly anyone was there .
speaking of bar , i was excited to try their vanilla porter .
well , she did n't get it .
the kick and finish of this beer did not impress me .
the layout of the place was somewhat unusual .
the two beers that i had were decent but not amazing .
the service was awful .
nothing good or personable about it .
next time i 'll take the extra _num_ minutes to get to four peaks .
also i noticed the menu was really , really random .
they do n't specialize in any particular type of food .
fish and chips , and then some southwestern dishes ... .
whatever , i appreciate small , local restaurants but this place is all wrong .
at that point i 'm never coming back .
the weather was fabulous .
she returned a few minutes later for our order .
next time i 'll just try sitting at the bar .
atmosphere was very lame for a thursday night .
the majority of the beer was just plain boring , and warm to boot !
even the root beer was flat and tasteless .
i really , really want to like it .
the waitress was n't very friendly and seemed to be uninterested in being pleasant .
shame i paid $ _num_ to upgrade from regular fries .
my companion saw she was just standing around in the back not doing anything .
mediocre food ... if it was what i ordered .
the beer was ok but nothing great compared to other breweries around town .
i really wanted to like this place , sadly disappointed .
wo n't go back ... the owners really need to step in !
wow .
big mistake .
shrimp tacos : way too salty and overcooked .
macaroni & cheese : not bad , but it 's mac & cheese .
for the price food was n't that great either .
from our three drinks ordered , we only got two .
it was also a bit dry .
no salt , no vinegar , nothing .
been here before and it was way better than this last thursday !
the relatively indifferent waitress informed me that they were out .
well , i tried it and did n't like it .
no big deal .
that was before she completely ignored our table for _num_ mins .
my favorites were the hefeweizen and vanilla porter .
very disappointed in their service .
the waitress would grab the beer and scoop out the ticket .
i will not be back .
the problem lies with the horrible service .
after _num_ minutes , i made mention that we still did n't have them .
another girl said the order must have not made it to the kitchen .
another _num_ minutes had passed and i then told the bartender .
it took another _num_ minutes on top of that .
never once did anyone bother telling me what happened .
honestly , no one even gave a sh*t either .
my buddy even commented on that after we left .
no one even cared .
clearly the first person did n't put the order in .
i wo n't be going back .
they were the ones conveniently located at the bottom of the stack .
i hate being asked , then end up disappointed .
starting off , the pasta was over cooked .
i really doubt we will return .
if you 're into great craft beer , do n't waste your time here .
not impressed at all .
poor service , decent beer , poor food .
next time , i 'll buy a _num_ pack and host my own gathering .
unbelievably horrible service .
our first experience was ruined by a very rude waitress .
no more to be said ... it sucks i wanted to enjoy my visit .
all of this with only _num_ people in the restaurant and _num_ wait staff .
very disappointing and not worth the money .
probably _num_ tortilla chips .
i went here last week with a friend to try it out .
i ordered a large mac n cheese and the garlic parmesan fries .
it was n't noted that it was beer mac n cheese either .
unfortunately we both left hungry .
our waitress was nice but it was clear she was ready to go home .
we chose to try to sit at the other bar .
this is one of the worst experiences at a restaurant !
our waitress did not know what was going on the entire time .
my drink was empty the entire time .
beers that were listed they also did not have .
_num_ .
not cabana .
second room given - handicapped cabana room in back corner , no balcony .
however , i find this highly unacceptable .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
not a good vibe at all .
not awful - just not good either .
staff was a plus .
i 've almost never had a bad experience w/ hilton staff .
very awkward and inconvenient lay out .
this place is tired on every level .
staff is polite and friendly but thoroughly inefficient and clueless .
never again - not recommended .
ah , and well , they do n't reply to emails either .
it looked cheap .
it is actually tile that looks like dark wood floors .
we thought is was cheap vinyl .
well i got ready to crawl in about _num_ pm .
the bed was awful .
the linens were not hilton quality .
i could have called but that late i did not want to move .
overpriced & horrible housekeeping !
if i had n't prepaid i would have left on the 2nd day .
i was not comped .
motel _num_ service at a hilton price .
just stay somewhere else & save yourself the frustration .
horrible experience .
i stayed at this hotel for a conference in october _num_ .
this happened to several of my other coworkers as well .
the employee did not take the smelly blanket away .
i would absolutely not recommend staying at this hotel .
i did n't actually stay in the hotel & i was glad .
everything about this hotel screamed tired .
beyond the convention cleanliness issue , everything was old & tired .
i did n't get the impression that things were gross , just over used .
i wo n't be staying here any day soon .
the ac was not working in room .
no one to fix at night .
the thermostat had to be _num_ years old .
property could not fix .
terrible layout .
old , tired property .
worst hotel stay in years .
i was scheduled to stay _num_ nights .
_num_ .
how in the heck did someone get a key to my room ?
_num_ .
i called front desk and they sent housekeeping to my room .
not my fault !
( they did comp my room , but still very unacceptable . )
otherwise the service was not consistent and the building is very old .
here are why i am giving only _num_ stars .
- i really liked their chicken noodle soup on the first day .
phoenix light rail runs right along central , or whatever .
in fact , they never even returned my fucking call .
pro tip : light rail drops you off a block from here .
it could use a renovation .
not good for kids .
not good for dogs .
no apple pay !
methinks not . ''
i used to like this doctor , but now i do n't .
i wish i had never gone .
it 's still rough _num_ weeks later and not healed .
you just lost your company a regular client lady .
front office is very unprofessional and rude .
Negative
they charge for negative tattoo space so it 's double the price .
aka they are charging for non existing ink in a tattoo area .
makes no sense .
just trying to get more money .
i was n't expecting to have to ever go through this again .
at least not with the same one ?
extremely disappointed with the results of my mini face lift and brow lift .
but now you ca n't even tell i had anything done .
my neck is awful , it looked better before .
just disgusted that i threw my money away .
so , so unhappy .
it 's not worth it to go to this place .
after the surgery i was unhappy and told them that .
even after the second surgery , i am still not happy .
the receptionists treated me poorly .
that is ridiculous .
if i could give this agency no stars , i would .
this starbucks has been remodeled and now looks like a hospital cafeteria .
i hate this new look and will not be back ever !
btw - the place was empty at 10am on a saturday .
it 's starbucks only with bad customer service .
baristas with attitude that do n't know their own product .
he again repeated that i would have to purchase something .
especially when there is no signage stating that the bathrooms are for customers only .
did n't feel like coffee , tea or food today .
office is a little bit old but not too bad .
the customer service ( from the top ) is horrible .
when i buy _num_ or more .
they will not be getting anymore of my money .
a company should not have employees that scream at customers .
worst .
right now my pizza is _num_ minutes late .
i 'm cooking and will refuse it when it gets here .
i was threatened by the delivery driver after he messed up my delivery address .
i got no where which the corporate office also .
lousy customer service .
she supposedly even called .
no pizza .
no phone call .
not even an apology or an attempt to make things right .
worst customer service ever .
i would give them no stars at all if i could .
this is unacceptable !
( they never let me finish it ) .
at least she was n't chewing gum .
going over to another agency ... sigh .
she was n't very friendly while working with me .
i drove an hour total through this whole process .
i am _num_ months here , i got lost .
if you 're in an extreme situation she will not help you .
they put me through all that crap just to tell me that !
i was hurt and drove _num_ min to get my finger prints done .
what a horrible system .
i wo n't stop .
horrible .
i kinda felt like it was disorganized .
i am not trying to leave my full time job for that .
dont waste your time !
i refused .
it was a waste of time and gas .
i would waste time with them .
highly ignorant people .
i was told there was nothing she could do ( jessica ) nothing .
disappointing turnover with grill chefs .
she was answering phones and scheduling appointments while working on my nails .
a monkey could have done a better job !
i will never attend this salon again !
i do not get acrylics nor do i get gel polish .
i like a traditional natural manicure and this place does not deliver .
because of the poor quality manicures i will be looking for a new place .
$ _num_ for a gel fill ?
i could have easily trimmed and painted my toes at home .
also all the techs continuously talked to each other and rarely to their clients .
not customer friendly at all .
why is this my fault !
why make an appointment if you ca n't keep it .
and you do bad work !
i had the worst experience here .
it was dirty , unsanitary , and way overpriced !
it 's gross and the people who work here are unprofessional and rude .
the woman who did my nails did a horrific job .
it 's like _num_ dollars more then at other places .
another thing i can not stand is when people ask for cash tips .
i would never ever go back to this place .
this place is so dirty and unprofessional .
avoid at all cost !
i will not be coming back .
i payed $ _num_ for sh*t acrylics .
i could have done them myself and they would have turned out better .
that is not what i asked for .
i can not tell you how upset i was .
she needs to go back to beauty school .
it is honestly not hard to match a picture .
so disappointed .
unless you have an appointment , do n't bother .
their time management is n't very good .
my daughter & i went in for a pedicure .
i was beginning to think she did n't speak english .
i guess she did n't like what my daughter was saying .
this place does n't make you feel welcome .
worst experience .
the nail tech named judy made both of these experiences extremely uncomfortable and unpleasant .
she was very rude and i felt pushed around and like a huge inconvenience .
`` what the hell just happened ? ''
what an absolute dive , and not in a good way .
not even _num_ min !
... it 's a dive bar and not in a good way .
not my favorite strip club by a long shot .
it 's too crowded ; there are too many chairs for this tiny club .
her : ca n't .
her : fuck you , you pig .
i will not return to this establishment again when in the area for business .
i would not consider this a gentlemen club .
the only positive note was they have an extremely friendly bouncer .
service was bad .
the waitress walks off and i take a sip of my drink .
and it 's some kind of harsh house vodka .
the worst part is the `` manager '' never made an appearance .
i 've been to better but there is also worse .
i would give it _num_ stars if i could .
stopped in from out of town and our experience was a nightmare .
there were many waitresses fighting over our table , we were so incredibly uncomfortable .
the owner of this place is probably clueless of what goes on here .
this club goes all out in trying to rip you off .
they constantly give you that `` i wan na fight '' look .
i do n't like getting the cold shoulder .
the staff at this store is very rude .
as though i were in the wrong place .
they definitely lost a customer today -- and for all future visits .
but , it sound horrible .
it just was n't `` smooth '' sounding as you would expect .
i wo n't be going back .
after getting over that the waitress brought over menu and chips and salsa .
took one bite of the salsa , that was it.
threw a buck in the table and walked out .
i went with authentic mexican friends and none were impressed by the food .
i called it mediocre and they called it less than .
furthermore the decor and vibe in the place is lacking .
nothing too special about this place .
i was severely disappointed .
the service was horrible .
the staff was friendly , just incredibly slow .
granted , the restaurant was full .
i 've had better mexican food in alaska .
wo n't be going here again .
not enough cooks & servers to feed the mass of people who eat there .
visited on march _num_ for dinner with a large group .
the chips and salsa were eh , ok .
i ordered a chicken enchilada and a beef taco , no sides .
the food was bland and not too flavorful .
unfortunately , a person in our party found a hair in their taco .
i was disappointed with this dish .
it was greasy and had too much cheese .
it was also fairly bland .
visited juan 's after reading the numerous complementary reviews .
unfortunately , our experience did not come close to that of more enthusiastic reviewers .
this is terrible .
the food is very bland and service is very slow .
the employees act like they 're the only restaurant in town .
do yourself a favor and skip this one .
however , the food in my opinion just is n't good .
the meal was just very disappointing and took over _num_ minutes to serve .
it seemed like your basic run of the milk - nothing special mexican place .
the flavor was very blah .
i was disappointed and to be honest the service was not great .
she did n't even try to fake a friendly smile .
ten minutes later , she just took my plate and walked away .
had they actually informed us , we 'd have gone , no hard feelings .
chips and salsa were old and tasteless .
taco shells were old -- meat was tasteless -- rice was cold .
really , really bad .
sports fans take note : there is no cable tv .
i do n't get it .
the bill was $ _num_ !
completely ridiculous .
over priced and not even that great .
the chicken was so salty and the pizza was burnt .
never going back .
horrible service , whether busy or not .
pizza is always limp , soggy or undercooked .
pizza cookie is ok .
go to scottsdale or tempe location instead .
people would tell me i just `` have to try oreganos '' .
drinks refills took longer than they should have .
no thanks .
i find it much too salty and not really worth the long wait .
not bad , but ok.
the pizza , i just do n't understand the hype .
service was weird , and i 'm pretty sure our server was on coke .
do n't bother .
but i must say the garlic is what ruined it for me .
do n't think i would go there again if i was in town .
this review is not for the food.
this would have been repeat business no less .
as far as pizza goes ... um no thanks .
are you freakin kidding me ?
you did nothing right in this transaction .
it was almost laughable .
but the alfredo the dark with chicken was such a limp noodle for me .
was that really chicken lunch meat sliced thick in my pasta ?
for lunch , really ?
for starters we ordered the bistro calamari & boom dip .
total ( not including tip ) was about $ _num_ .
this was the absolute worst calamari that i ever tasted !
it did n't even look like calamari .
it was thick strips that tasted very very fishy .
we sent it back and ordered fried ravioli .
when it arrived , it too , was way over salted and tasted stale .
the food was great but the service left a bad taste in our mouths .
that said the experience here was pretty awkward and uncomfortable .
we said ok , we 'd like to check the bar .
really not cool .
really bad for business .
not what i want to see .
this time i visited the oregano 's on camelback and was pretty disappointed .
no worries , that does not bother me really .
the salad was terrible and i had been so looking forward to it .
however recently something seems a miss .
noodles were doughy and chewy and clearly different sized than the old method .
the chicken was in huge chunks vs the old shredded style .
disappointing since this is a place you are willing to wait for .
staff is also so young and distracted with one another at camelback location .
but now inconsistent food ... drops a notch for me .
i barely finished one slice .
i think food out of a garbage just might taste better .
i would give this place zero stars if i could .
i love oregano 's , but this specific location is terrible .
the food is not prepared as well as the other locations .
it was bland & tasteless and way too oily .
it was simply the worst lasagna we ever had .
costco frozen lasagna is better than this sorry excuse for an entree .
for that reason alone , i ca n't go back .
the hot wings were not good .
the person next to me had the thin crust which looked pretty good .
on top of it all it was a little pricy for pizza .
i would not recommend this place .
food was good , service was terrible .
the whole experience was rude .
will not be back at this location again .
this is no exaggeration .
there is really , seriously no place to park .
i was always very excited to eat here but disappointed once i was there .
everything i ordered was less than awesome .
no exceptions .
awful experience this week .
a quarter of the salad was not edible .
those people just do n't care .
we had the worst service ever !
i was so disappointed !
i had surgery monday and was in pretty poor shape .
sooooo disappointing - i will never again order take out from this restaurant .
tonight ... this place was horrible !
very disappointing !
was n't a fan at all !
sorry , not much positive to say .
i was craving alfredo .
what i got was undercooked boxed pasta with no taste .
but will look elsewhere for my pasta fix .
extremely disappointed with the customer service at the take out counter .
never asked for anything free , and i paid for my entire meal .
however , that 's not an excuse to be unpleasant and rude .
do n't eat here .
the worst experience ever .
our _num_ minute wait was close to an hour .
no apology and definitely no better service .
what used to be out favorite place has gone to shit .
avoid this location .
longest hour of my life so far !
entree salad was fair .
shrimp diablo was too hot .
i love spices food but this was ridiculous .
no bargains here on lunch entree costs .
the food was alright but the customer service was poor .
will not be coming back and would n't recommend .
disappointing .
dip was good , artichokes were a little tough .
we continued to eat and my husband ran out of pepsi , completely .
to be fair i tried oregano 's twice in _num_ different locations .
i have tried lots of pizza in arizona from many different restaurants .
the pizza is sooo marginal .
no really , the pizza lacks flavor and super skimpy on the toppings .
there was barely any pineapple on it .
i will not be back to this place again !
we were so hungry and craving pasta from oregano 's .
at this point , i am super hungry and getting a little frustrated .
i was so mad at that point .
the place is clearly slow .
this was such an awful experience .
very weak knock off of chicago style pizza .
crust was ok and the pizza sauce was bitter .
she the accidentally gave our wings to the customer in front of us .
i was disgusted by their customer service .
no thank you .
my first time at oregano and i got to say i 'm disappointed !
overall a complete waste of money .
ate here yesterday and i 'm never going back .
the salad was good but the pizza took incredibly long to get finished .
finally got refills only to come back with a dead fly in my cup .
overall this place was just a let down .
just a do n't try to pick up food for take out .
i was to frustrated to wait any longer so i just left empty handed .
both visits here were not the best .
it 's the service that seems to be lacking .
this is the worst dry cleaner i have ever gone to , bar none .
man , do i pity dana 's employees .
pathetic .
three strikes , and i gave them the gift of another .
filed complaint with the better business bureau and guess what ?
they have ignored it .
however , the problem just occurred again today .
do n't mind me just getting excited over ranch .
this garbage is the epitome of , well garbage .
gross !
the bad news is the prices are outrageous .
true value usually has lower prices too .
do n't expect exceptional service & you wo n't be disappointed .
the cashier responded with a `` why would we offer you a discount ?
this exchange was not in their policy so they could not do it .
ace i am disappointed in you .
do not get keys made here !
i am so annoyed with this ace .
i had _num_ keys made , _num_ did n't fit .
went back to have the _num_ fixed , _num_ still did n't work .
i got _num_ made , _num_ did n't work ( sound familiar ) .
one of the keys still does n't fit .
everything you might want in customer service is not here .
i 've shopped here several times too many .
management is horrible .
the dishwasher sucks big time !
the security gates are always stuck open , so anyone can come in .
if i could give this place no stars at all , i would .
i can not wait to move out .
if i could give a _num_ 1/2 star i would .
we hardly ever hear our neighbors on the top or bottom of us .
ok , now lets get to the things that are not so great .
the place is still very loud around the apartments .
do not get an apartment facing any of the streets !
the windows are like paper and leak air like crazy .
i come in to eat something real quick side i was still working .
everytime i hit this mcdonalds it 's so slow ... .
_num_ cheeseburgers a fry and a drink .
i was there approximately noon .
the parking lot was full but the dining room was n't .
it did n't take long to give my order or get my food .
no napkin dispenser out where customers can get to them .
does make me wonder when was the last time he or she ate there .
i left _num_ messages with people and _num_ messages on their machine .
no response ever .
communication is horrible .
emails and messages are rarely returned .
she lacks the desire or ability to truly support the owners in our community .
you will not be satisfied as an owner .
i have to constantly fight and argue with those people .
this struck all of us as a bit of an excessive wait .
do n't go unless you 're willing to wait , though .
for just a simple pizza sub it was roughly $ _num_ .
when they handed me the sandwich i was really disappointed .
no meat , no seasoning , no nothing .
very disappointing place and the food was n't that great .
i actually felt really awful about myself for having ate it .
i do n't know , i threw them out after one bite .
have been dying to try this kosher place for some time .
went tonight and ordered a large _num_ cheese pizza .
o m g american cheese ?
are you kidding me ?
it was _num_ with a drink .
so sad to see this neighborhood gem go veggie .
the italian was to die for .
got ta say that this place failed on the majority .
service was slow and rude .
sure enough $ _num_ later , he said he could not do it .
we would have to take the engine apart and truck was not worth it .
so , i trusted him and did that .
see , i do n't really like this place .
and i , quite frankly , remain unimpressed .
i 'm down with the fusion , only if it 's done tastefully .
seared tuna ... was far from seared .
sushi rice was a bit soggy too .
i ordered the clams in broth .
that tall white thing we saw was a vanilla cake , not the cheesecake .
i wo n't bother with desserts of fancy drinks next time .
slow service .
sushi was n't bad , not awesome .
so overall ... weird experience ... will it keep me away ?
i opted for the shrimp udon soup .
i did get an added bonus of deep fat smell covering my clothing .
unfortunately this means the food quality has become very inconsistent .
_num_ .
he could n't have been less concerned about serving us .
_num_ .
the tempura we ordered was very blah , nothing to write home about .
_num_ .
i ordered pad thai no tofu again mild .
how can you go wrong with pad thai .
the noodles were so over cooked it was disgusting .
_num_ .
that 's the only good thing i can say .
i have not been back .
my sister has but my experience left a bad taste in my mouth literally .
you get _num_ stars one for decor and one because my sister likes it .
that is n't what is wrong with cherry blossom .
the problem with cherry blossom is the service which seems to be getting worse .
we were seated immediately in the back room which was empty when we arrived .
at that point , my wife flagged down the host who took our order .
it just seems to get worse and worse at cherry blossom .
cherry blossom will not be getting any more visits from us .
this particular night , i opted for the miso marinated sea bass .
the server never brought it to me .
not in that order , but you get my drift .
if anybody 's thinking of checking this place out , get takeout .
and this place went downhill in quality and service over the last _num_ years .
it 's generally crowded with rushed service and the food has yet to impress .
after sitting down our drink order was promptly taken and filled .
it was not .
the sushi was c grade .
passable but not anything i would return for .
the miso soup had iceberg lettuce in it .
first , bad service .
waiter did not bring us a bread .
order was slow .
sushi quality was bad .
yakisoba noodle was burned .
husband had chicken parm .
is that my noodles were not good !
might be for some people , but it 's not for me .
i 've driven past a million times and kept thinking to try noodles .
wth was going on .
honestly , i probably wo n't be going back .
it was n't bad , just was n't special .
i ordered the chicken pad tai - thinking it would be a safe bet .
also - the food was very bland .
not a hint of kick to it at all .
however , the service was less than stellar .
there were just _num_ of us and _num_ dishes between us .
i can not believe so many other reviews were soooo positive .
_num_ .
it was not the best combination to say the least .
there was hardly any miso in the soup .
_num_ .
an insult to the patron of the restaurant .
how lazy can this restaurant get !
_num_ .
this one is not as bad as some other asian fusion restaurant .
the guy from the next table was complaining that he was drinking water !
i know it is sealed but , really ?
i saw _num_ sushi rolls ordered by a couple that came in after myself .
not impressed at all .
what a waste of my precious hard earned money .
this is a place that requires much better management and service .
( after waiting for _num_ hr , this is what we got ?
turned out that was a big mistake .
the other one was even worse .
i wo n't recommend this restaurant to anyone .
horrible service .
barely acknowledged when you first walked in .
will not come again .
i always substitute rice noodles , never had an issue .
as much as i love their food , they have lost a customer .
this was our 3rd visit to cherry blossom .
we 'll , we have made the decision it 's not that great .
but , its either that or loose more customers due your very bad service .
avoid avoid avoid .
service was terrible and food was below average .
the salmon sashimi was not good .
i ca n't remember when i have ever left fried calamari on my plate .
i will avoid in the future or at least these menu items .
this was my first time visiting cherry blossom noodle cafe .
i really wanted noodles , ie a noodle bar .
the food was average , but it was the service that left me unimpressed .
the waiter was short and was very impersonal .
there were only two other tables being served too .
he 'd refill our drinks and was on the ball .
but the employee culture is greatly lacking .
bread was basic bread , nothing special .
first , the noodles looked like what you buy at the supermarket .
am i wrong to expect restaurants to actually prepare food from scratch ?
that 's why i spend money in a restaurant !
lots of supermarket stuff , at a premium price .
sorry , that 's not why i go to a restaurant .
so why did i even bother trying this place ?
as someone else said , there 's really no place to wait .
it was very busy .
this is not the first time it 's happened .
this was one of the few times yelp has led us wrong .
unfortunately , it was downhill from the point we got our food .
the sushi all tasted fishy .
the worst experience i 've ever had .
ridiculous .
so disappointing .
was craving sushi and decided to give this place a try .
ordered the sushi combo , added a miso soup and bowl of steamed rice .
waited forever to get a refill for my drink forever .
this place should get a big fat no stars from me .
the waiter is rude and really just horrible ( the make waiter ) .
they were not wrapped properly and just fell apart !
they also serve italian food , kind of weird .
its not the typical hole in the wall feel .
got the pad thai and added chicken .
i immediately stopped eating , finished my beer and left .
rude .
rude .
rude .
at a table for one , i ordered a squid salad and three rolls .
, and replied , `` i 'm sure gon na try to ! ''
to which she argued , `` but you are so thin ! ''
ridiculous .
i am so disappointed and insulted .
japanese and italian ?
service : place was packed and service was extra slow .
i probably wont b back .
surprised with all the yelp reviews ... disappointed .
one would think that the owners would at least look at the reviews .
is there no manager !
on the downside , the service still was horrible in every way .
so , no good news here .
avoid .
very rude service .
the place was totally empty .
the only other customer in the place was leaving .
i have to sit in the back where i could smell the bathrooms .
unbelievable over _num_ empty tables and i was told i have to sit there .
i then immediately walked out !
very disappointed !
for a well seasoned asian food eater like myself , this place fails .
i 've had the smoked salmon ramen and the udon stir fry .
neither were very good .
ramen was too salty and the udon was bland .
the sushi is about par with the grocery stores .
my biggest gripe is the terribly slow service !
he did n't bother to check on the status of our food .
if you have time to wait for mediocre food -- be my guest !
a shame .
i decided to stop in for lunch since i now work in the area .
he apologized and tried to make it better .
i just was speechless at this point .
i will be actually calling and filing a formal complaint as this was unacceptable .
i will be back but refuse to sit in his section ... ever !
i 've been craving ramen and this seemed like a sure bet .
i left with utter disappointment .
he even rushed our forgotten to-go drink as we got to our car .
nope , not the case at all !
extremely rude !
it does n't make any sense at all .
this is my first yelp review ever .
Negative
it 's rather unfortunate it had to be a negative one .
if you want nigiri sushi or sashimi , try hiro sushi .
the worst place i have ever been too .
this place is nasty , horrible customer service and small .
not impressed with the ambience or menu .
food is about average , service is too bad .
we had dinner tonight and tried several dishes .
the rice was a little hard .
the vegetables were cut too thin and ended up overcooked .
the pad that had no flavor and the meat was way overcooked .
disappointing .
there was very little people inside the restaurant as we arrived around 2pm .
this strawberry cheesecake that was more like a mousse filling than cheesecake .
the side salad that came with it was wilted and boring .
i felt like i was eating a spicy spaghetti soup .
the meal just looked thrown together and not appealing to the eye .
i do n't think i 'll be back ... maybe for the dessert counter .
however , the service was really bad .
so i do n't understand why it took so long .
it took _num_ mins to get my menus .
the staffs were unfriendly and gave off weird vibes .
maybe the food is fine but obvious problems with the service .
terrible service and overrated ramen and dessert .
dessert was only good looking but tasted so-so .
can not believe the male server is still there .
the server neither explained the menu nor gave me any suggestion directly .
i wish there was a way to give zero stars .
he was extremely unpleasant and was not willing to explain anything to me .
he was rushing me and was extremely rude .
udon soup as did my co worker .
bad service and bad food .
no thanks .
parking sucks .
this place is pretty amazing !
could n't resist !
the lighting is dim for a restaurant and the sitting are has wooden tables .
soon as i walked in a was greeted and sat .
she just walked away and never came back .
i am not happy with the customer service at all .
the food is mediocre and not worth coming back !
decided to try this noodle cafe and was highly disappointed !
they have italian pastas and then they have their noodle options which were confusing .
no pictures of the noodles but minimum description .
i do n't like katsu .
had i known i would have not ordered this entree .
the curry alone was not appetizing .
my food was lukewarm if even warm .
the only good thing about my food was the rice .
my plate looked as if i did n't even touch it .
horrible service !
this time around , yakisoba was super oily and bland .
the food is awsome .
i am extremely disappointed by the customer service provided by this office .
absolutely do not recommend this doctor or his staff .
you guys are what gives the health care industry a bad reputation .
i returned the next morning to return both items as my camera was stolen .
i lost $ _num_ on a $ _num_ purchase .
i strongly caution you to read their policies before buying anything .
they do n't .
no one asked if i needed help when i came in .
my experience was not pleasant .
they are always soo helpful and they have way more stuff .
ca n't say the same for this place .
no online ability to take money .
wo n't take credit cards over the phone .
wo n't take american express .
do n't know how this store stays in business .
we called ahead to your store and inquired if you had one .
we had _num_ minutes to travel _num_ miles .
he could have cared less .
i wish your business luck for the future .
the price of the lens is $ _num_ retail .
do n't tell me you only make $ _num_ on a lens sale .
this place is the absolute worst .
i would much rather go to best buy or use amazon .
this telephone call occurred on november _num_ , _num_ at approximately 6:00 pm .
she then hung up on me .
no kidding .
everyone else at the club was friendly , helpful , and welcoming .
but this in no way excuses her complete lack of professionalism .
do n't bother coming here .
the staff was unapologetic and every single one of them gave us attitudes .
mexican pizza was extremely gross .
do n't go at night terrible service .
big taco bell fan just not this location .
but this is ridiculous .
my boyfriend left and realized they short changed him by $ _num_ .
he drove away and had to come back for his money .
they did n't turn off the lights or anything to signal it was closing .
to the empty kitchen .
she opened the window and gave us the missing food .
horrible .
totally disgusted .
out of beans , beef , and chicken .
what the hell is the assistant manager doing all day ?
what a poorly ran establishment .
and the manager is too lazy and rude to deal with the problems !
i was having some brake trouble last week .
the buttons were off of it .
no one apologized still for it .
it this does n't deter you from here i do n't know what will .
it ended up taking three hours as they waited for a part .
the car works great but the customer service left much to be desired .
they do n't deserve it !
saved myself $ _num_ .
the 7th st location is a scam shack .
$ _num_ in tax ?
i suppose your $ _num_ brake special already includes the coupon .
for all of you , please be warned .
i took it into a repair shop and spent over _num_ dollars in repairs .
total rip off !
i genuinely cant believe people can be that dishonest !
if i could , i would give this place _num_ stars .
this tells me they either did not listen to me or did not care .
either way , strike _num_ of many .
no phone call from them after the initial assessment at 2pm .
it was not done .
this part that should take _num_ minutes once received took over _num_ hours .
fast forward _num_ more hours and they have not arrived .
later that night the manager blows up my phone to get paid of course .
i honestly have never received such terrible service in my life .
i was certainly wrong .
it seems the corporate office does n't even care about their customers .
you have been warned .
woke up early on my day off to make an 8am appointment .
11am i called for update .
1pm i called for update , they say another hour !
however , i had my first frustrating experience .
they do n't , ca n't or wo n't answer questions via email !
`` it 's ok , if you ca n't afford a cadillac . ''
this is horrible business .
one thing is for sure , the owners will read about it .
i sincerely apologize for what happened last night .
service scam alert !
they told me both where fine and that i had been lied to .
i did so for today , calling in the morning for a 1:30 appointment .
it 's been over _num_ hours ?
i go and let him know what 's my truck doing there ?
we took it back & they said nothing was wrong with them .
we do not buy our cars here i am just here for a recall .
normally we 're down the street at camelback toyota .
well they must have spoiled us there because the service here sucks .
neat looking place , terrible customer service .
so were waiting and he never shows up to greet us .
so they kept my car all day with no warning .
ultimately , they want to keep my car over night .
i am so upset at the poor customer service i received .
( so extremely rude ! )
i will not be going back !
i bought the filter for $ _num_ at autozone and installed it myself .
no exaggeration on that !
the first repair was n't even the problem .
the next step would be a class action case .
look below to see the final decision offered to us by gm .
they have referred to our issue as `` unexpected '' engine problems .
apparently this is a problem that many of this year and model have had .
that 's not unexpected then on the part of gm .
terrible service for repairs .
it gets worse .
let me repeat that , the terrible repairs were done in march .
none of these to the best of my knowledge exist on my vehicle .
sadly , it appears things have changed since i was a child .
once he left we were unsure of what he actually said .
the escargot came and did not taste as great as i had remembered .
the salad had more then enough dressing , luckily the dressing was good .
the plate looked very plain with items not being placed in any nice manner .
the halibut was slightly over cooked and did not have much flavor .
it was difficult to speak to one another over the many other loud conversations .
overall , i would not return to this restaurant nor recommend it .
he then proceeded to take the other tables ' orders .
on the way to a much nicer and hospitable establishment .
i had never been so offended in my life .
i could not hear any more .
funky house salad with a creamy ranch ( ? )
dressing and one slice of bad hot house tomato .
white french baguette bread and butter was plentiful , thank god .
the stuffed mushroom appetizer was bland and my veal entre was drowned in sauce .
the service was _num_ star , i 'll give them that .
i could tell the dressing was house made as well as the croutons .
the fresh spinach on the side was just plain without anything on it .
my husband had a pasta with italian sausage and chicken in a marinara sauce .
the chunks of canned tomatoes were unappetizing .
first time but never again !
disgusting food , terrible service .
things started poorly .
the flavor of the sea bass was lost in the tomatoes .
yes the prices are very reasonable but the food and ambiance are nothing special .
food is adequate but not authentic .
ok , this is entirely sad .
but , not this new year 's eve .
bread , butter , olive oil ?
here 's my problem .
not tonight and that 's sincerely sad .
not up to their par .
it smells like mold & cleaner gone wrong .
not appetizing !
even if your family has eaten here for _num_ years .
no explanation .
no apology .
not a pleasant experience after the drive .
when i inquired , debbie was curt to say the least .
later called me and told me the part `` was on back order ! ''
why oh why would we want to do business with them in the future ?
i have never been treated so bad .
i will not use them ever again .
now , most people know insurance only covers rentals for _num_ days .
poor customer service all the way around !
instead , they had it for _num_ days .
very unprofessional , and i will never bring them my business again .
very rude and very unpleasant & very unprofessional !
those two women should n't even have a job !
i would never recommend this collision center to anyone .
not sure what planet they are on but both should not have a job .
constant ignored emails and calls with the excuses of a school grade child .
both cupcakes were made from a mix .
neither my husband nor i cared for it .
the rye bread barely tasted of rye , although it had a decent texture .
i was appalled that i had to `` prove '' it was bad .
i could not believe this man actually tasted the cake .
this just set me off .
these little bakeries then wonder why they have to close their doors .
sound 's good does n't it .
it 's been that way for sometime and is n't getting any better .
the result is for the most part i tend to avoid the place .
i 'll spend my money there .
another reason not to go there is not their fault .
it 's rather sad to have to write a review like this .
says it 's kosher , but apparently only sometimes .
i arrived and was met at the door by the sign , `` sorry .
so i went inside , wondering if it was an april fool 's joke .
they could not help me .
no yummy kosher flourless chocolate cake would be in my immediate future .
they were tasteless ... everything is the same tasteless flavor .
everything else leaves me flat .
if she would let me use my card .
when i went in , there was a guy behind the counter .
it was really uncomfortable ... .
she just stared at me .
so , i purchased _num_ pastries and got out .
i walked in and looked at the cases .
i wish i could like the idea of going there .
so , here 's a run down .
puff pastry was flavorless .
however , i did like the service !
i brought _num_ bagels to my students and we found them to be stale .
that meant i was going to miss my little sister 's baby shower !
: ( that made me incredibly sad .
holy mary , mother of god , was i dead wrong about that .
i have never cried so hard in my life !
seriously , i was a wreck .
after a recent visit , i still have no idea .
honestly , it 's just not any good .
and my loaf of `` fresh sourdough '' was stale and completely tasteless .
eh ... .
the pour was okay , i 've had better elsewhere for the same price .
not horrible but i doubt i 'll be back .
i do not like saturdays here .
like , under _num_ young .
did i get the word rude in there ?
nick does n't work on saturdays .
it 's just crap .
those guys you were hanging all over were n't even interested in you either .
they were just too drunk to care .
my gay neighbor took me here for afternoon cocktails on a sat .
the bartender was unfriendly and the bloody mary had no alcohol .
gross !
not true and not cool .
i informed them and all i got was sorry .
if you are `` drunk and annoying '' do not come here !
no freaking way !
all in all , fuck that place .
this place is not a local dive bar .
the employees do not care about anyone who lives in the neighborhood .
our experience here was crappy .
but the service and attitude of this bartender was horrendous .
i ca n't believe she has a job there .
then she says `` why is n't he answering me then !
like a damn toddler screaming for attention , that 's what she sounded like .
she just did n't deserve anything .
unless there is another and nicer bartender on duty .
the missing _num_ stars .
everything is dirty , this place needs a deep clean .
Negative
low key we could have hopped the bar , grabbed our cards and left .
this guy is ridiculous and does not deserve anybody 's money .
$ _num_ to have a starter motor and fan put in .
learn from my mistake , and stay away .
$ _num_ down the drain .
slow .
the dealership was less than this repair shop .
he owns the retail shop too , so skip that as well .
i have not had a leak in over _num_ weeks since the replacement .
and advised me with what i needed help with .
she later had a man talk to me that was just as condescending .
left the place feeling like i did n't get what i wanted .
you know i am a paying customer too .
what a horrible place to get service work done .
place is a total rip off i will never go again .
when i went to use it the next week it still did n't work .
i repeat do not !
my little brother was placed here and it is atrocious !
apparently the left hand does n't know what the right hand is doing .
the food is horrible and does not fit with any type of dietary needs .
i would n't feed that to my dog .
i can not stress enough about not sending your loved ones to this facility .
rude lazy people who do n't care .
contrary to what others posted the inside of the building did not stink .
none of the food i saw looked appetizing .
it 's dirty and there are roaches , bugs crawling on the walls .
the staff also does not do nearly enough for the people staying there .
it was so noisy too and smelled like animals !
why are you using email if you are n't going to check for responses ?
thanks but no thanks , i left .
i would not recommend them to anyone .
i first went to this dermatologist years ago and it was a so-so experience .
i will not be returning .
i never even saw a doctor here , something i find strange .
i would never go back again .
the wait time for my appointment was long .
the office sent over my rx to my local cvs .
and nothing .
would not recommend this office to anyone .
my appointment lasted about less than _num_ minutes and was not very thorough .
complete waste of my money .
if u could give _num_ stars i totally would .
this is n't a facility that i would ever visit again !
wow , this has been the worst experience and care ever .
it turned out that they do n't take my insurance .
so i had to leave and wait for the referral to be fixed .
wow , what an annoying experience !
she 's _num_ years old and this guy is man handling her .
the office is old and seems dingy and dirty .
i would not recommend this place to my worst enemy .
office management needs to step in and fix asap !
i can tell you staff is not pleasant at all !
i expected to have a paper gown in place for my exam .
bottom line - an awful experience .
never again will i visit this office again .
they did n't lose or damage my clothes and they all came back fine .
however , i certainly was n't blown away with the customer service .
the parking situation also sucks .
i took _num_ coats in to be altered .
and not that good .
once again the reception person was not only unfriendly , but downright rude .
but when i pick up my shirts they 're all folded up and boxed .
no word to me that they tried and could n't get them out .
they just pressed them into the fabric more and sent me on my way .
but i wo n't be back for a while if ever .
if its friday , hey , maybe we should have more than _num_ barbers .
however , i 've had two miserable haircuts in a row .
he could not help me with that .
in any case , i do n't think i will return .
needless to say , my hopes were let down .
this is not a very hard haircut , mind you .
the whole time , i was faced away from the mirror .
i am still left with cut marks _num_ days later .
i beg any of you that is reading this review to avoid this shop .
_num_ ) appointments kept on time .
_num_ ) warm towel and massage .
whatever you do , dont give them your personal information .
this place has changed so much and not in a good way .
all i can say is thank god my hair can grow back .
me almost two hundred for an oil change and adding coolant .
there is nothing special about this place .
the conversation was totally inappropriate and forced us to eat outside .
this is one cheap owner .
poor value , ok quality .
nothing special , to be honest .
sadly , sonic has better tasting hotdogs and buns .
i know why i have not ever stopped in ... .
what a disappointment !
it was firm , but not dry , and full of flavor .
now , it 's bland and tasteless .
no more .
the selection is n't what it was .
waiting _num_ minutes for a drink however is too long .
so , clearly the musician 's make the night .
our night was not so hot .
the neighborhood is questionable .
the entrance is not obvious , the bar and the service are not inviting .
not worth it .
`` umm ... i 'm not sure can you hold ? ''
`` dude , i just said _num_ . ''
a _num_ , _num_ or _num_ series ? ''
`` dude , i have no freakin ' clue what size engine it is .
+ previously mentioned worker was friendly .
- $ _num_ for oil , tire rotation , air filter .
_num_ minutes from the time i pulled up till the time i left .
i 'll be asking for my money back this time .
first and last time i wo n't be returning .
after all i am the customer and i was not satisfied at all .
( issues , lost time , money and gas i lost . )
rating _num_ stars only for the cabinet quality and resolution work .
the installation was certainly sub par , not on time .
the finished products were poorly executed in places ( cabinet doors off center ) .
i tried to get that corrected , but no response came through .
not a word was mentioned about it from them , not a question !
they are so ignorant !
other than that , camelback vw is as sleazy as they come .
yeah i know sounds like most any used car sales operation in phoenix .
tell us the car price + tax , fees and registration .
they had taken up yet another night and this offer just plain sucked .
that 's when we walked for the last time .
simply did n't trust them .
do not buy a car from this place !
the all time worst experience i ever had with an auto dealer .
spread the word about this horrible excuse for a business .
no customer service at all .
had an issue purchasing a vw back in _num_ .
i 'm not having to take my issue to the better business bureau .
they 're just not worth this much hassle .
i totally get all the bad reviews from these guys .
my purchase experience was just o.k .
once you buy a car there , the customer service is over .
it 's ridiculous .
_num_ .
if you are looking to buy a car do n't go here .
_num_ .
it amazed me how many times they would overlook things during maintenance .
but i would not recommend camelback .
my salesman was marty , who was very helpful .
long story short i took it back and got my audi back .
i leave the lot get into traffic and this car will not move .
barry , my salesperson , was wonderful .
he first showed us this car in awful condition .
the manager flat out told us to buy the car or to leave .
i 've never been treated this poorly at a dealership in my life .
i had cash to buy a car and opted to go elsewhere .
went through all the standard bs that buying a new car comes with .
everything went downhill from there .
ca n't recommend highly enough that you avoid these guys at all costs .
first , our salesman mario seemed irritated to have to be working at all .
_num_ weeks sitting on the lot in less than clean condition ?
but ultimately i decided to buy , and get financing through vw credit .
while i was doing the paperwork , i was told the car being detailed .
it appeared that they they just gave it a quick wipe down and vacuum .
i brought the car back the next day and the customer service was horrible .
when i got the car back , they had n't done anything to it .
i waited _num_ hours for nothing .
finally the paperwork arrived and all was resolved .
moral of the story : do n't waste your time with camelback vw .
i drive over _num_ miles to see this car .
now one was there , they tried the old bait and switch on me !
why would i want to work with anyone who flat out lied to me ?
stay far away from this place ... .
the sales experience was fine , but this dealership does not respect your privacy .
contacted them through the internet , no response .
called the general manager , did n't receive a call back .
low miles , great price , and in amazing shape .
i ask for the warranty to be removed , only to be told no .
i get my tires replaced , only to hear a new noise yesterday .
this time i was quoted $ _num_ !
oh my gosh what a horrible nightmare this has been .
avoid .
they should move the waiting room away from the sales floor area .
if i did n't have lifetime oil changes i probably would n't come back .
i ran out of gas almost immediately after the fuel light turned on .
unbelievable .
what a bunch of , well , use your favorite word .
avoid this place at all cost !
take it from me avoid this place !
this is the worse car i have ever owned !
why did n't i check it out at first ?
all my repairs were not covered by the basic _num_ months warranty .
these guys will rip you off !
the buying experience with any dealership , i found it to be as expected .
the local dealership never responded to my complaint .
my experience is far too long to write on here .
i have been lied to and taken advantage of on more than one occasion .
of i could return my truck and cut all ties , i would .
my finance advisor had me come back and sign my contract four times !
not sure where to begin but i 'll give my experiences .
all i got was `` i made a mistake '' .
right then i knew they were liars and flat out dishonest .
think twice before servicing your car at camelback vw !
the grand total was $ _num_ !
total repair is less than $ _num_ .
worst ever .
Very negative
if i could give a negative star i would .
one of the worst vehicle purchase experiences ever .
terrible .
terrible dealership !
there is a reason why they only have _num_ stars !
we also have had bad experiences with the sales department since .
do not let these people get your contact details .
terrible dealership !
there is a reason why they only have _num_ stars !
terrible dealership !
there is a reason why they only have _num_ stars !
i get here today and no loaner .
`` i 'm not interested in financing i have my loan . ''
`` no i do n't want a $ _num_ car payment . ''
ridiculous . )
i do n't think an intelligent word came out of her mouth .
we could see straight through this woman 's fake demeanor .
shame on you camelback vw .
instead of saying , `` no , '' he just hung up on me .
big mistake .
it is a big dealership so looks very trusting .
they made up the 2nd time though .
_num_ months later i was stranded the battery died .
not holding my breath on this place .
it 's been two days , and they still have n't called me .
i unfortunately got a car from this place !
never , ever give these people your contact information .
you get the point - do n't wait , buy now at any cost !
oh no - that price did n't include dealer fees !
not _num_ months .
not $ _num_ a month as advertised on their own website .
they would n't let me test drive the car .
they would n't honor the advertised deal .
do n't walk - run - from this dealership !
i have purchased _num_ cars from camelback vw and had good experiences .
she did not see a problem .
they gave excuse after excuse as to why it was a low trade in .
this place is truly the worst place to buy from .
i will never use them again because they do not do what they say .
it was the most horrible experience i have ever been through .
being so sick of arguing and speaking with this company i just agreed .
i will never purchase a vw again .
i informed him that i was the original owner of the auto .
he told me to contact camelback vw to figure this out .
this is the worst dealer ever .
do n't buy your car here .
one star does n't give justice to how shady these people are .
they called to tell me the bank would not approve me .
i would n't refer my enemy to this dealership .
get ready for more business vw north scottsdale .
i was a bmw customer for over _num_ years .
it drives like a _num_ series .
the service warranty offered by bmw however leaves vw in the dust !
strike _num_ !
strike _num_ !
so they are fixing that too , so hear i sit for _num_ hours !
strike _num_ !
it was torture .
just disappointing that the communication is n't better when the dr. is backed up .
they have a good selection , we just felt really unwelcome .
not cool .
not the kind of experience i expected of a place geared to all ages .
i was disappointed to say the least .
i do not recommend this store due to the way the staff treats people .
the staff need some serious training on customer service .
a walgreens with no liquor ?
seems like they already lost their spirit .
they do n't care about marketing .
it was horrible .
i could 've had the same experience watching it on my ipad .
do not waste your hard earned money .
i walked in and there was nobody in the lobby and two gentlemen working .
then i told him i would like to get an oil change .
three of the worst dollars i 've ever spent .
bad idea .
the chips were soggy and no crunch to any of them at all .
i 've had better and it could be spicier .
my $ _num_ could have been better spent at taco bell tonight .
i ordered a bean and cheese burrito for $ _num_ .
you 're _num_ % not the only burrito in central phoenix .
unbelievably expensive and very misleading the way they explain things !
no frills .
we walked out paying nearly $ _num_ .
lisa contacted me directly to discuss our experience .
bringing our own case could have saved us a few hundred dollars !
stay away from this installer .
maybe their reviews were closed because they were bad .
but i 'm glad i went for comparison shopping .
so , i made an appointment for last saturday to check it out .
( all of the dresses i chose were under $ _num_ . )
the assistant mgr was the nasty girl ever .
she made my bridesmaids feel unwelcome and she was very rude to me .
they just need better staffing .
service = crap .
was told it 'd be there in _num_ weeks .
_num_ weeks later , i call , am told it could take _num_ weeks .
worst service ever .
they were rude , unprofessional and i will never recommend them .
the owner is missing , and the phone is not working .
horrible customer service .
would not recommended this place .
i 've used the shuttle service often to get to and from work .
german auto said i needed to replace my battery .
i wont be returning to german auto unfortunately .
not even a sorry when i arrived the next day .
very rude and horrible customer service .
if i was the owner of this shop i would fire that employee immediately .
very disgusted with their customer service .
i work up the street and stop here one or twice a week .
be prepared to be upset it is gone has been for several years now .
not very appetizing , but i 'm willing to give any place a chance .
worst fried ice cream we 've ever had !
bad .
very bad .
ordered a combo : sour cream enchilada , taco and tostada .
this place has been around forever , but i ca n't really understand why .
the restaurant is run down .
there are many better options for mexican food around this area .
they were basically corn tortillas with some shredded cheddar cheese melted on top .
check yelp first , no matter how good a deal it seems .
sadly , we found jordan 's .
horrible .
sadly , we did n't have any salsa to put on it .
the visit in november is likely my last .
the service was terrible .
it was edible , but not great .
i am being utterly polite by giving this place one star .
you 've been warned .
outdated , dingy , dining space and help .
avoid it !
sadly nostalgia does n't make the food here any less bland .
what we got was gray meat , with not one ounce of seasoning .
but saw quickly that we would not be buying that story .
this is what happens when you have uninspired people making food .
too sad .
i 've been driving past this place for quite some time .
the service was typical of what you would typically expect from such a restaurant .
my wife and i both the green corn tamales w/ beans .
to be fair , the tamale was ok .
the most disappointing part of the meal was the salsa .
by far the worst salsa i 've ever had !
i really hate giving this _num_ stars .
my _num_ cents !
i 'm not exactly sure .
i ordered a chicken burro enchilada style .
the enchilada sauce topping was also quite flavorless .
just do n't eat here .
just ca n't seem to find anything positive to say about this place .
this place was absolutely terrible .
at least there 's an excuse for food being bad when it 's cold .
my _num_ minute interaction was enough .
my tostada on the other hand was good .
other than that , it was an ok meal .
never rated a place this low before .
the menus came with dried up food on mine .
they eventually came and brought us typical chips and awful salsa .
it tasted a little like flavored tomato paste as well .
he asked what kind of sauce , we said green but on the side .
went in at _num_ ; _num_ for an early dinner .
waited _num_ minutes , and no one came to seat me .
i was disappointed to say the least in the food and the cost .
menu was hard to follow .
chips were good .
was sadly disappointed .
very uncomfortable .
it 's living hell .
am i not also a paying customer that also had an appointment ?
should n't you finish my car before starting work on a different car ?
i 'm sure it was probably my neighbor who was calling in the complaints .
never did anything wrong to this woman .
do n't waste your time .
i know exactly what i want to make i just need some assistance .
i explained i did n't want a class just some assistance .
four times she repeated herself regarding her class .
however i ca n't seem to give them my money .
i 'm solely giving this place _num_ stars due to the selection of wigs .
i almost walked out .
i could not have been more annoyed .
i am giving this business one star due to the poor customer service .
there was no compassion and advise from the sales clerk .
it was definitely not hot enough .
want to piss me off ?
not last night , not today and certainly not tomorrow .
i have been wanting to have americanized chinese for a week or so .
after driving up 7th st .
definitely cheap , however not worth more .
the dining area smelled like a bait shop , the bathrooms smelled even worse .
i was quickly greeted , though , and directed to my seat .
my drink order was taken before i even sat down , which was nice .
not exactly appetizing .
why _num_ stars , then ?
bad .
out of business on april _num_ , _num_ .
gave us a ridiculous quote on a simple solution .
then tried charging us _num_ $ just to diagnose the issue .
they do n't deserve _num_ star !
i usually do n't write reviews but my experience here was horrible .
i was not pleased .
which was very unprofessional .
inspect your purchase while you are still on site .
i get better service at home depot .
not impressed .
me : ok , can you substitute noodles for rice , please ?
now i can see why the employee was so confused .
there was no sauce in my rice bowl .
it was just chicken , rice , egg , and green onions .
now it is plain dirty .
their miso soup was cold and spoiled .
i would never visit this location again .
even for fast casual japanese food , it sucked .
it was like hospital cafeteria veggies .
it was not worth $ _num_ or whatever the price .
one of the worse meals i can remember having .
i would not recommend .
i called in my order , the meals were ready when i got there .
terrible lunch service .
ordered at the counter instead and spent _num_ minutes waiting for the food .
ridiculous .
menu is reduced and new people are running the show .
last four times i came for lunch , it was awful !
used to be a favorite lunch place , but not anymore .
sadly , the food quality and flavor has left this location .
why ca n't i stop eating this delicious food ? '
this is no longer a problem .
it seems that most of my meal could easily be tossed aside .
wow ... this place has horrible customer service !
i will not return here .
tokyo express was the place to go in phoenix for teriyaki chicken years ago .
why and how can you ruin a place like this ?
beware , in my opinion there are better places out there for japanese food .
do n't bother .
worst asian food i 've ever had - nothing asian about except the name .
they were bland , the beef looks like and has a texture of pork .
our teriyaki chicken was dry and the wait was long .
the car has not felt remotely right since it was in their hands .
they seem far more on top of things .
added more then $ _num_ to my final bill which is not the issue .
very disappointing .
no lox for me .
i 've given it about _num_ chances now .
the service is terrible , at least for take-out .
wish it could have been scott 's .
i 'm sorry .
this is the first time i 've been disappointed .
let me explain the _num_ star ... .
why yes , it was your friendly neighborhood roach !
too bad .
most likely will not be back .
used to come by once or twice a month for lunch .
the last time i was here was some time in _num_ .
the service was bad .
and then leaves .
i did n't know what i wanted , so i said , water .
the sandwich was dry .
it did n't have mayo or mustard on it .
i ordered `` french fries '' , but they were more like country potatoes .
severely disappointed .
$ _num_ ... for two crappy sandwiches , and some under cooked potatoes .
really horrible , all the way around .
the soup was also cold .
this was bitter and not smooth .
unpleasant .
you got ta be kidding me .
disgusting .
meatloaf was a friggin ' nightmare .
not sliced from a loaf , but a patty that was baked .
super well done , chewy crap .
carrots were overcooked ; mashed potatoes were ordinary .
my bill was $ _num_ .
with tip , $ _num_ .
service was polite , but a little slow .
i am so angry that i paid for this crap .
this is the second worst meal i 've ever paid for in my life .
i 'm _num_ .
very , very bad restaurant .
ugh .
however ... .
i only had $ _num_ ( only ? )
left the waitress $ _num_ .
it was terribly salty , and not much peppercorn taste .
bread size is the same as an ordinary square loaf of sandwich bread .
not coming back to this place .
speaking of the food , it was pretty terrible .
honestly , i would have rather eaten at home .
i 'm posting a picture of the nasty moldy food we got .
dirty and filthy , food is awful , place filled with bugs and roaches .
then no one washed the table !
gross !
bad food bad service greasy matzo ball soup .
skip this dump .
i literally took one bite and left it was so bad .
these people were so unbelievably rude to me .
i 've been wanting to try scott 's for years .
during the end of the lunch rush scott 's was empty .
ignoring these details was a poor choice on my part .
there were chicken bones in my soup .
it was not prepared to go .
the pickles were the only bright spot of the meal .
by this point i was so over it i just wanted to leave .
six hours later my stomach is upset .
this morning , my wife , daughter and i walked there for brunch .
we sat out side , ordered and ate .
the food was average , and a bit overpriced .
the place was a little dirty .
the food is forgettable and the service , was beyond description .
living in the neighborhood , i 've been to scott 's maybe three times .
you would think that you get your sandwich wrapped in gold leaf .
scott 's does not give me any reason to return .
the service is atrocious .
i once stood at the counter for almost _num_ minutes before being acknowledged .
disappointing deli .
my daughter would n't even eat it .
the breakfast was gross .
waited _num_ minutes for basic breakfast .
should have just come in for a bagel and probably would have been satisfied .
there sub should be priced at _num_ tops .
their pickle taste like its been marinated in salt .
these people were so unbelievably rude to me .
ordered takeout for lunch at work .
so today , i was feeling horrible .
service was kind of slow , but friendly .
it was n't worth my lunch hour .
really gross !
-- small , hard , and with an off taste .
deli sandwiches were ok.
the corned beef was wonderful but so overcooked in my scramble .
tough little bits of meat in the way overcooked eggs .
i had to add salt and pepper and it was still tough and bland .
the bagel was over toasted and tough .
overall , we will not come back and feel so sad .
not that there 's anything wrong with that , but it felt strange .
service was adequate , but a bit slow .
this was awful ; just awful .
it was obvious her english was limited .
i should have just got up and walked out .
i realized she had n't asked my what kind of bread i wanted .
she finally came around and said , `` sorry they 're so slow . ''
i could barely find it .
the grilled onion was inedible .
the pastrami was sky high but tough and not juicy .
with a drink my bill came to $ _num_ .
wo n't go back .
this place is not good at all .
then she brought it without sour cream .
the pastrami was literally flavorless .
the only good thing we had was the potato pancake .
owner yelling at employees in front of customers !
bad , bad , bad .
i would never try this place .
it was dirty as well .
i was tired of waiting and went to the counter to leave .
waited another _num_ minutes at the register for them to get my ticket .
otherwise , it wo n't do well .
i wo n't be back .
awful place not the same .
i bought a breakfast burrito and a vegetable omelet and paid $ _num_ .
just really strange customer service -- almost like they did n't want the business .
i will not be going back to them anytime soon .
even bad pizza is n't half bad .
zero , and i mean zero flavor in this pizza .
and where in the heck do you find flavorless pepperoni ?
terrible !
pizza was below average .
i usually come during the day time to avoid the candle light atmosphere .
pizza still good but anything else is boring like the music .
boring should n't be loud .
good pizza , lousy service !
what a mistake .
we sat for over _num_ minutes and no service .
hence the two star rating .
there was n't anything bad about the place .
oh , ok , stupid me .
i give the place _num_ stars for an ok cheese pizza .
it was n't the worse pizza but it was mediocre at best .
she did n't offer to take anything off the bill and made .
she clearly has no idea what it means to be a server .
the crust was tasteless and soggy like wet cardboard .
i 'm so disappointed .
i am confused about all the hype .
my order came out to $ _num_ .
$ _num_ per wing ?
the wings were soggy on the outside , and over cooked on the inside .
what a waste of time , and money .
it was the most tasteless thing i 've ever eaten .
too bad , i wanted to like this place .
i will not be returning here anytime soon .
overall rating _num_ out of _num_ .
it was hot in there .
i am very disappointed to say the least !
i ordered fried zucchini sticks which were pretty good !
i 'm glad i just did n't order a full pizza .
no soda came and the wings were rock hard .
such a waste of money .
i will not be returning .
i had split a spinach salad with _num_ medium wings .
they were tiny wings and the sauce was just too watery and not great .
i picked pieces to eat , but threw much of it away .
undercooked noodles in the spaghetti .
the meatballs in the spaghetti were bland and overcooked .
the spaghetti was terrible , it had a weird taste to it !
no effort !
i do n't know why this place has _num_ stars .
pizza hell !
the dough was not too good , not too bad .
it took them _num_ minutes to complete our order .
the wait was too long !
i did n't even get everything i ordered .
service was horrible .
the place was empty !
our hostess set us down in the main dining room .
_num_ minutes later our waiter arrived and took our order .
he had our table confused with someone else .
the pizza was just basic pizza .
employees forgot to place order and all the could do was say sorry .
talk to several employees and no one seem to know what was going on .
worst experience ordering pizza .
the chicken was more of a chicken patty or chicken nugget type of texture !
the frys and the wings were also noticeably from a bag .
our waiter is attentive at first but things slowly grew worse and worse .
this was one of the worst experiences i 've ever had at a restaurant .
all i asked for was actual cheese and not vegan cheese .
wrong , i thought the server 's head was about to pop off .
then he proceeds to bring out my actual sandwich with a side of fries .
i paid for my salad and my wine because that 's all i ate .
it was n't a busy night and i was not being unreasonable .
i visited this establishment for a take out pizza experience .
i walked in to an environment that was not well lit .
i waited at the counter ... no one was around .
i waited some more ... no one was around .
lack of quality .
if you like pizza and respect yourself then do not go .
raise your hands high turn around and walk away .
sorry , not sorry .
4th gluten free pizza - do not order this option .
4th time is not and nor will be the charm for these options .
but i was n't impressed .
thin crust pizza was horrible .
ca n't eat and look at that .
horrible service .
they lost a customer as a result of the lack of good customer service .
however , the customer service is terrible .
but this time around , it was not great .
she never apologized .
we live _num_ minutes away .
i do n't need to know how you feel about your staff .
um , its _num_ right ?
my buddy had told me they had awesome sandwiches as well .
the sandwich itself was forgettable .
and when we get the bill i notice nothing was comped .
nothing done to make it right .
our waiter had no personality and was invisible most of the time .
thin crust pepperoni was very blah .
no interest at all in eating it - not worth the calories .
i 'm quite annoyed that i wasted $ _num_ for dinner tonight .
bad customer service + bad food = fail !
after being seated , we orders drinks and an app .
jalapeo peppers were average at best .
it was really just average food with not so great service .
)
needless to say we left as soon as we finished our drinks .
i was totally embarrassed .
i 'm not really a fan .
a few years back i was treated with horrible service .
we approached the owner about it and he treated us like crap too .
i told him i have n't , that i know the laws .
it was not .
this was a week later and the charge went through .
they said they would have someone call me back .
so , its a really racist place that i do not recommend .
so , it 's a really racist place that i do not recommend .
unprofessional and lazy .
and i 'm calling to talk to ron or lee who own the place .
ok , a bit of explanation why i gave this place _num_ stars .
the waitress was stressed out , even though the place was n't busy .
so i think there may have been a staffing problem the day i went .
we opened the door , looked in , and walked out .
did n't think that was possible so we did n't stay .
we feel obliged to warn people about this terrible place .
without soul however , gumbo is just chicken soup .
obviously someone needs to tell him because he has n't got a clue .
he could not have handled the situation worse than he did .
her effort gave the place two stars instead of one .
what a mess !
also , crowded and dirty .
they could even raise prices .
i do n't care how cheap your product is .
not a big fan of this place !
i even tried calling the district mgr .
i am still waiting _num_ days later for a return call .
this is not a place to rent storage space from .
i 'm really getting tired of the rate hike and no notice .
this place is terrible .
terrible laundry facilities .
if you can avoid it , do n't live here .
i 'm still killing and finding roaches even after all of these treatments .
within a week all of my clothes and towels smelled musty and its terrible .
if you get within _num_ feet of it , it absolutely reeks .
this immediately stopped when i was given my keys .
i wish i would have listened to the other reviews .
but , it still feels hot in my apartment .
another problem i 've had is my stove almost everything is broken .
the laundry facilities are ridiculous they are always broken .
the pool is not up to code .
the pool is green and gross looking .
the only time they are ever fixed are when the rent is due .
the money goes to new equipment in the gym that no one uses .
bad , bad , bad .
bad service , bad food , bad experience .
i wanted to like jenny 's , but it just sucked .
and the food is atrocious .
i 'm not really sure when it changed .
hubs and i stopped for breakfast .
now , i understand something going wrong with your order now and again .
but seriously , our waitress was training someone !
stone cold .
pancakes , laughable .
let 's just say that he had a very condescending attitude .
live up to the customer service standards expected of you !
hell no !
way to go denny 's ihop for me next time !
there 's usually a wait ( even at 2am ) the place is packed .
under normal circumstances i would walk out of a place like that .
my friends are poor and denny 's open late .
otherwise , you should never eat at denny 's .
i rate denny 's a _num_ out of _num_ and please read why .
denny 's is that go-to place for any and every occasion .
if you want a late night hangout this is awesome .
and the food is not good at all .
i will not go back to this denny 's .
me and some friends walk in and get seated last saturday night .
it was late so we was n't rushing them or anything .
the waiter finally comes over ... does n't say hello .
if you hate your job get a new one .
not too happy with the service last night .
waitress was kind of mean to me when i asked about the wifi .
we walked in and the first thing we smelled was sewage .
nothing special .
beer is beer .
sorry i put my corona on the pool table .
i 'm sure that 's never happened before mr .
not much else , unfortunately .
$ _num_ , the bartender tells me .
i like paying $ _num_ in fees for a $ _num_ beer .
( with tip , as its not his fault his job sucks . )
instead , i just i do n't get it .
this place reeks of cheap .
so i give it a _num_ out of _num_ .
even if you like that sort of thing , just go elsewhere .
service has went downhill quickly .
we went for the beer specials , which were good .
it 's a very cheap place to have a drink .
the pizza i had did n't impress me .
it tastes like cheese substitute that comes from a bag .
the bar feels dirty and i imagine it looks worse with bright lights .
i never come here and i wo n't likely be a regular .
guess cash does n't matter here .
no more gay cash from me today at the chili cook off .
kyle needs to go to customer service school .
we 're standing at the bar waiting for service and are simply ignored .
some staff there think they are running studio _num_ .
walked in the other night and the place still smells like sewer .
but the service and the wait staff are the absolute worst .
ok.
because , frankly , i 've done that to myself already .
screaming , laughing , crying .
totally out of control .
suddenly i find my throat to be dry , irritated and burning .
all were simply horrific .
horrible .
no bueno .
hello , my name is thomas .
we exit the line , $ _num_ lighter , and find a seat .
wrong .
wrong .
wrong .
it was bad .
everything was bad .
first it is not a buffet .
this place makes taco bell seem gourmet !
are you kidding me ?
everything else was not a pleasant taste !
my stomach wishes i had n't .
the cheese enchiladas were disgusting .
the sopapillas were good , the icecream ?
there are n't many mexican buffet restaurants in phoenix .
the salsa is n't very good ; it 's bland for a mexican place .
the food selection has gotten worse & the price higher .
i made the mistake of going here on a whim .
awful , shitty bland mexican food .
i 'm not much of a fan for this place .
)
now they ca n't get me in for another month !
they did apologize , but i will not risk having this happen again .
but i will not be among them .
they have no idea what kind of problems i might have .
they did n't care .
the problems started when my first appointment was cancelled without my notice .
i called last week to confirm the date , no call back .
i called to get my refill after saying i had made an appointment .
no call back .
here i am again without meds .
when i called to make an appointment , i was equally impressed .
firstly , this is a very small office .
they fixed something else instead and gave it back .
way to check your work , jerks .
this place is awful .
i walked out of here with a serious bad taste in my mouth .
this is a dishonest shop .
Negative
do n't be one of their sucker customers .
i will never take my car to get serviced there .
we 'll today , wednesday i call him because he never called back .
he said it would just be too much money .
and if that was why he had n't called back .
are you assuming we do n't have the money to fix it ?
you 're terrible business person .
very unprofessional .
Negative
there should be a negative star rating ... .
worst place that i 've ever been .
i paid $ _num_ for an estimate .
andrew was rude and lied right to my face .
he quoted $ _num_ .
i did it myself for under $ _num_ .
i purchased the vehicle and a warranty through desert schools .
the ahwatukee branch used to have _num_ atm 's .
the atmosphere was very unprofessional and unfriendly .
chase is worse then them and that is n't saying much .
really , i never heard anything from any loan officer !
this bank can not be trusted with your money .
they do not stand up for the consumer against businesses they suck !
they denied me a job and are assholes .
i do n't like anyone who works there .
they need to get off their high horse .
you can usually find them anywhere from $ _num_ to $ _num_ a pair .
buffalo exchange is no longer like that store .
the only thing that 's generally alright is their shoe selection .
`` they did n't take my stuff !
not really .
did that make me feel bad ?
the jean prices are a little higher here as well .
ten dollars for _num_ dresses , _num_ new tops , and _num_ new belt .
are you freaking kidding me ?
what a total scam .
silly me but that just does n't seem to add up .
she was about _num_ and obviously was n't trained to recognize good merchandise !
i miss the glory days of buffalo .
i feel old ) this used to be my favorite store .
she was pretty snotty and rude .
i am still amazed that this even happened .
i think the salespeople and `` buyers '' are very ignorant about fashion .
gross !
i guess that 's what happens when you work in the industry .
on another note , the customer service just plain sucked .
the prices here are crap .
not going here again .
i wish i could give higher rating .
they just have a `` ca n't be bothered '' attitude .
i guess i was n't `` cool '' enough for her or something .
however , i stopped in last week and experienced something totally different .
for the first time , i could n't find a thing i actually liked .
*** turns out the picture i put up was of the wrong guy .
again , i called their office multiple times before someone answered the phone .
not so .
however , after that i never heard back from them .
that happened _num_ times .
so , i drive over to pick up my pizza .
i walk in and i 'm greeted by a couple guys behind the counter .
i tell him to forget it as i will take my business elsewhere .
this same technique was used on me before a chinese restaurant in west phoenix .
fool me once shame on me .
fool me twice , screw you !
i like domino 's pizza when i just want to have cheap pizza delivered .
this location however is awful .
_num_ .
there are only so many crust options .
i do n't know what i can do '' .
i probably wont order again .
in case you have not yet noticed , you have many competitors .
once again my local dominos lets me down .
there is something wrong with this dominos location .
this place is awful .
pizza was _num_ minutes late and cold .
then laptop to place an order online .
the customer service is severely low class .
unfortunately , there was a problem with the computer .
this man was totally weird and his behavior and attitude felt very unprofessional .
also , it is byob for wine .
the most unprofessional and offensive experience i have ever had within the service industry .
sorry , i do n't plan very much ahead .
next time i will , and it wo n't be here .
not soggy and warm .
this place was rather disappointing .
just left here not fifteen minutes ago .
this one was with salad .
another lackluster presentation , but that would have been ok if were good .
he did finish .
the wait person said ok after we are done she will send someone out .
but it might have been because i guess i caught her off guard earlier .
very disappointing and irritating .
very misleading , the classic bait and switch apparently still works .
still , my tab : $ _num_ .
they might have not even seen it , but for my asking .
no visit from the manager , no complimentary desert .
we split two entrees - filet mignon and lamb shank .
lamb shank was cooked well , but the sauce sucked .
the entrees , however , were fair .
i 've had much better lamb elsewhere .
the entrees were especially disappointing given they were rather expensive .
unfortunately , i did n't have time to try dessert .
but i wo n't be going back .
well , this is the 2nd time my fiance and i have been here .
i must say , i 'm disappointed .
what i did n't like is their problem with gratuity .
ok , so this was really incredibly depressing .
the filets were delicious but extremely overpriced as was the pork tenderloin .
wow , did we have a disaster with this restaurant .
i originally gave it a three star rating .
that was the first bad sign .
later , i called groupon and asked what they suggest .
i called and unfortunately the same guy got on the line .
well , he opted not to do so and hung up .
you can tell it was a full house but just incredibly understaffed .
i then ordered the lamb and my boyfriend ordered the pork .
just melted in your mouth i was super jealous .
it was awful .
the service was mediocre .
the hostess ruined our entire experience .
not worth a visit .
service : horrible .
we had a reservation and they made us wait for _num_ min .
they did not have the courtesy of apologizing for making us wait .
trust me it was not a pleasure waiting with two kids .
the owner was not at all friendly .
never stepping in there again .
the lamb shank was cooked perfectly , but the lamb flavor was missing .
it was okay but no real mint flavor to speak of .
after valentine 's day here , i felt taken advantage of by the restaurant .
- brie brulee : a name far more interesting than the dish itself .
- salad : greens , fruit , nuts , and too much dressing .
it was fine but not worth $ _num_ .
- filet mignon : my boyfriend seemed to like it .
it , of course , tasted like chocolate .
i 'm confused why everyone calls this place charming .
if so , you should look into a bistro , and pay bistro prices .
extremely poor service and attitude !
their attitude was terrible !
i would never attempt to go there again .
lamb shank was mediocre with a dull and thin flavored brown sauce .
the bread is weak too .
went for restaurant week .
i 've had better steak fries .
disappointed .
not impressed .
wrong .
i 'm sad that i wasted one of my restaurant week picks here .
wo n't be back .
i would not spend any money at this place .
the people that run it are very unprofessional .
i was very disappointed and will not return .
she could n't seem to focus on the class .
it was a total waste of time .
i think the class is soo long to schedule in dawn 's day dreaming .
i was ready to scream !
thank god i only went there on a $ _num_ coupon .
i 'm never going back .
i 've never had worse mole sauce .
i would n't even call it mole sauce .
it was just bland , which is really bad in my book .
no wine in sangria ?
ok i hated it !
seriously i would prefer to eat at taco bell than return here !
service is mediocre .
she was okay but obviously not to experienced .
i ordered the steak fajita $ _num_ .
i could not eat it .
she kindly offered to get me something else .
off the top of my head i said a chicken enchilada .
it came out , and it was even worst !
i said it was better , only meaning it was not as salty .
sure glad my uncle al could cook better than this .
not as funny , i did n't agree .
that 's just gross !
mediocre at best .
not too tasty .
salsa blah , beans and rice too salty .
only thing i feel confident in recommending is the mexican pizza app w/ chicken .
other than that , the price is too expensive for the food served .
if anything , you should check these guys out for that .
the quantity was great but this is no trip to flavor town .
the chips and salsa were terrible .
too expensive for quality of food .
once i was greeted , the service was very impersonal .
chips and salsa came immediately .
i ordered my usual - shredded beef tacos .
days passed and nothing .
i went back in person again - was again promised a phone call .
days passed and nothing .
she told me the owner was out of town now for several weeks .
she just looked at me .
this place should be shut down immediately .
food safety and customer safety is obviously of no concern here .
no one appeared happy ; they were polite , but not much enthusiasm .
probably wo n't go back .
service was okay , food was horrible though .
this place has to be the worst mexican food i 've had .
terrible service .
they now suck and they used to be my favorite in the valley !
smaller , less toppings , worse tasting !
was not greeted at the front so we just sat at the bar .
- took _num_ min to get a drink order .
poor presentation on the salsa .
draft beer is luke warm .
please save your money and your taste buds !
i did n't actually eat here .
at least it want bland ?
the rice was n't sticky and fresh .
it seemed a little old and dry .
weak .
long wong 's quality is lost on this place .
bad , bad , bad .
a far cry from the south scottsdale location .
the wings i ordered were ice cold !
if you want good wings , try another location .
when i got there ( _num_ minutes later ) my order was n't ready .
after _num_ wings the ranch was gone .
the place is very dirty .
the kitchen is falling apart , it makes me gag just looking at it .
the dining area is filled with too much junk .
i ordered a dozen garlic parmesan wings and a order of fried zucchini .
i was skeptical pulling into the parking lot because it looked like a carnival .
long wong 's gets one star because the food was awful .
i ordered boneless chicken wings .
the medium buffalo wing sauce was hot but had no flavor .
otherwise , i highly do n't recommend .
we ordered _num_ meals and sat at a greasy , dirty table .
our wings and burger arrived and we were thoroughly disappointed .
came here for pizza and wings last night and the quality was way off .
the wings also were n't up to par this visit .
it made me pretty sad .
overall this visit was extremely disappointing .
decent for the money , but not spectacular .
wings were overcooked and dry .
wings were old and dry and gross .
this place is disgusting .
the seats looked and felt disgusting , and i was really disappointed !
servers clearly do not know what they even have here .
i merely ate here because of the good reviews .
the entire bottom was covered in oil and grease .
i could only stomach eating _num_ out of the _num_ .
it 's a dump in more ways then one .
i did n't even want to give it a star .
the place is a pit and it always has been a pit .
poor service rounds it off to a nice one star .
i will never be back .
their wings were n't good at all .
nothing to write home about .
lots of food , and cheap too !
frozen fries , frozen wings , canned chili , canned cheese sauce .
not underwhelmed because my expectations were in the right place .
if yours are , you will not be underwhelmed either .
the service was horrible .
one girl , kristen , is so rude it 's pathetic .
they will not tell you this in advance of your appointment .
nor was i told this by the technician or doctor .
i would warn anyone to be careful about this place .
i think she 's very hard of hearing .
it was difficult booking the appt on the phone because she could n't spell .
she stated `` no '' .
in this moment , i knew something was wrong .
clearly , it would have been better to be ethical .
instead she opted to lie and then over charge me .
i believe that he can charge whatever he wants for his services .
do n't come here unless you have plenty of time and a good book !
i would n't recommend this business .
i purchased glasses here almost _num_ months ago .
i 've been able to wear them for less than _num_ months .
_num_ months to get them ordered .
( scratches on the lenses ) i was ready to just walk away .
$ _num_ out of pocket after insurance .
the less expensive ones that worked the first time were not designer .
over priced , slow delivery .
lack of attention to detail .
i felt she was extremely unprofessional .
all of my family noticed how rude she was .
-- why is this _num_ block area of thomas stuck in _num_ ?
-- belly dancer goes after everyone in the room .
-- cuisine has come such a long way since _num_ get with it !
-- everything 's in _num_ except the prices .
so , i planned my boyfriend 's birthday dinner to be there last night .
i called _num_ weeks ago to make the reservation for _num_ people .
and why did n't they call me to cancel my reservation ?
the food was neither good nor bad .
either way , ive had much better gyro from other establishments .
it 's a shame this place blows so badly because it does smell amazing !
i walked in and one of the girls stared at me .
i said hello and she just turned around not even smiling .
i found the staff incredibly rude .
after walking out of the store , i realized i did .
i have had only issue after issue in the year i have been here .
last week the ac was not working for almost _num_ days .
my apt was _num_ degrees .
the office does n't care & the maintenance crew is rude .
stay far far away from this place !
yea i 'm sure that 's the reason .
each time i go by no one is there .
office hours are until 6pm i 've not seem anyone there after _num_ ever .
the water is turned off every other week .
and it 's illegal to leave your pet in your car !
horrible place do not rent !
the complex is old and run down and needs some serious updates .
i am clean freak and would constantly be cleaning .
i left the place sparkling clean so i was n't even worries .
not just for carpets but a fee as if i did n't clean .
also did i mention my bike was stolen off my second story room balcony .
so disappointed in the place .
you know something 's wrong when your hairdresser says `` oops . ''
two bad haircuts in a row .
bad haircut in september , took three months to grow it back out .
went in with a picture of exactly want i wanted .
i asked why and was told it looked better .
the manager and sales associates showed little to no concern .
this guy is not someone you want to to deal with .
i actually feel kind of sorry for him .
avoid .
their prices are not very good .
did n't like it .
nothing special .
i tried this tanning salon because each new customer gets a free tan .
she took me into the room and showed me how to use the bed .
the room is about _num_ feet by _num_ feet larger than the bed .
i tried several times during my _num_ minutes of tanning and still didnt work .
they tell me that a bed is ready when they are not .
but she advised me my membership was never frozen .
she told me tuesday her manger would call me back asap .
they were so terrible .
but , they did fix it and we gave it another shot .
terrible .
lost my sweater .
could n't call me back in three months time to correct situation .
do n't recommend .
if you value your clothes , do not use this incredibly unprofessional business .
go to american cleaners instead .
i will never return to this dry cleaner .
they destroyed _num_ of my husband 's shirts .
they said it was not there fault .
when i picked up they had changed me _num_ for one shirt .
management did n't care , so i will be going elsewhere .
in addition they lost a jacket i purchased in london last summer .
mens dress shirts are at least _num_ % higher than most other places .
in fact , i had to point out that the pants were not lined .
probably wo n't be returning .
this time they charged $ _num_ per piece for dry cleaning .
terrible customer service here !
this same shirt everywhere else was $ _num_ to $ _num_ .
i will definately not be back .
while i waited an associate approached me .
she told me _num_ % off .
katie then told me okay , without apologizing for the experience i just encountered .
i then proceeded to locate a corporate number .
katie then approached me with the stores number .
i can not tolerate this service .
i could not believe that the manager 's actions were just like the associate .
extremely rude .
i refuse to shop at this staples for my business supplies .
bad customer service .
whatever you do do n't call this store .
_num_ minutes i will never get back .
staff is lazy and rude .
this store is so terrible .
i 've wasted _num_ minutes of my life for _num_ pieces of paper smh .
i will never stop in here again .
sooooo ... ... disappointed in staples .
my mistake i purchased the wrong # .
worst customer service ever .
never busy but always slow as can be .
it 's not always clean .
copy paper is copy paper after all .
and , then you wait .
and , you wait .
office max is n't a great alternative .
unfortunately the only complaint i have all has to do with the print center .
he tried but did not know how to fix the problem .
it cost me $ _num_ .
i would probably think twice about going back for the steak and cheese sandwich !
this place is located in a big strip mall where i used to work .
i 've seen it a million times and never bothered to stop in .
well , it sucked !
they come in _num_ sizes , a small and a _num_ inch .
it was ready in no time flat , and man , it looked small .
and ugly !
then , i go to refill my drink .
fail .
do n't charge me for a fountain pop refill .
no no no .
this place was not what i expected .
yelp also let me down .
i also really hate giving low reviews for mom & pop places .
not good .
worst customer service .
i 'm going to cancel my account and do my business elsewhere .
i just closed my account at the tempe branch .
this store just is n't what it used to be .
as i searched for my phone i realized i had forgotten it at home .
seems like old navy caters more and more to kids and women .
do n't worry old navy store associate i will not be back !
whatever the case , i wont be back .
however , the meat did not look very appetizing and tasted very dry .
the sauce is very , very thin , which i do n't like .
sadly , i wo n't be going back .
sadly i was unable to eat anything but luckily i had my roommate along .
the ribs came out in a paper lined fry type cardboard box .
i stole a few bites so i could write this .
low sodium tomato soup !
when i was younger , i used to hate going here .
what the hell ?
i hate this place !
i do n't know why i ever go in there !
every time i go a michaels i am sadly disappointed .
the old lady cashiers are always rude like i 'm wasting their time !
they have lost my business !
horrible with a capital horrible !
total crap .
this michaels is awful .
really , really terribly .
the guy that helped me was fairly helpful , but the prices were ridiculous !
guess where i 'm going with the next picture ?
everything smells like cinnamon and i hate the smell of cinnamon !
i even smelled like cinnamon a day after going into the store .
that much is obvious .
ridiculous !
consider yourself warned .
the customer service at this michaels is just plain horrible .
this michael 's is disorganized !
the store itself does n't offer as much as other michaels locations .
they did n't have entire sections the other locations offer .
the customer service is n't good either .
i wish that for the hassle of parking alone they would offer more .
i 've now dealt with them twice - and both times sucked .
almost ten years ago , my dad died .
sadly , there are none .
i promised never to use them in the future at that moment .
i find them to be extremely unorganized and just an overall unfriendly .
i feel like no one helps each other .
ok location , but the management is a joke .
if there were a way to put no stars , i would !
do not rent an apartment here !
eventually just left and went to camelback location _num_ mins from here .
worst .
weird place .
we sat down and waited ten minutes .
totally ignored us .
walked back to the table grabbed our things and walked out .
you just lost a good customer .
the atmosphere of this place is loud .
the mashed potatoes were dry and partially cold , not very flavorful .
my girlfriend was as disappointed in her food as i was .
it really is a giant portion , two , three servings really .
texas people know their chicken fried steak .
for dessert my girlfriend and i shared the peach cobbler .
i went here tonight after hearing good things about the place .
i was very disappointed .
the food servings were large but the food itself was not very good .
the chicken fried steak had no real taste at all .
it was just bland .
salad just a salad and the bread was cold .
very disappointing .
i avoid fried foods whenever possible .
the portions were huge , but bland .
for what it was , it was pricey .
let 's face it : chicken fried steak is a vehicle for gravy .
the sides that accompanied the meal let me down too .
i just do n't get it .
this place is like a homeless shelter but with even worse food .
to sum it up , people swear by this place .
my husband and i came to texaz for our one year anniversary .
not too strong but not too sweet .
maybe i should have got the chicken fried steak .
i just did n't think it could be as bad as it actually was .
the booths are ancient , uncomfortable , and anything but clean .
the salad came quick - too quick .
the brisket was boring and overcooked .
the texas fries were not fries , nor were they good .
even the bread was terrible .
this was the most flavorless piece of fried chicken i 've ever eaten .
the breading had zero seasoning in it , and the chicken was not seasoned .
i was craving a taste of home and saw reviews for this place .
sadly the food was terrible .
however that would explain the ridiculous amount of condiments at the table .
it is not authentic to not season this dish .
the food was good and plentiful , none of us could finish our meal !
but this place gets _num_ stars for the service and experience .
i was soaked , embarrassed , and cold .
my dress would 've been ruined .
just sorry ?
no compensation ?
this should be your first warning .
how much falls in my food from the lazy ceiling fans .
do n't bother with the sauce unless your garnish for okra is tartar sauce .
the buttermilk ones taste homemade , not bad !
one of the worst meals i 've had in awhile .
was n't the best salad .
ate some of it and pushed it to the side .
even the mashed potatoes were bland .
i agreed and started to feel gross thinking about eating any more of it .
i hate kfc and i would much sooner eat that than eat here again.
slow waiter service as well .
chicken fried steak was completely flavorless as was the thick gravy on top .
stuff that is bad for you should at least taste good .
i feel like i was robbed !
the breading had no flavor and the gravy did n't add any either .
i like good chicken fried steak , but this was n't it .
i really wish i did n't listen to him .
what does n't get my ok was the steak .
my girlfriends food was n't that much better .
i have never not left a tip .
not worth it , never coming back here again .
nope , nope , nope .
firstly , parking is a mess .
if i sound pissed it 's because i was .
we did n't even bother with desserts .
service was awesome , and the people were cool .
but not enough to come back to .
i am so confused by all of the ratings .
first time i visited , my boyfriend and i ordered the ribs meal .
the ribs were dry and extremely salty .
their chicken fried steak was bland as was their gravy and mashed potatoes !
the gravy was flavorless as well .
disappointment and empty stomachs filled my household for the rest of the evening .
went to texaz on a whim wanting some steak and we were thoroughly disappointed .
i ordered the t-bone , which was small and grey .
huge disappointment .
my friend got the shrimp dish done on the grill instead of fried .
huge rip off for $ _num_ .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
the side salad that accompanied was fine too .
even the gravy tasted of flour and not much else .
a little seasoning ( salt & pepper ) would have gone a long way .
our visit to texaz is not one we will repeat .
yeah , i just dont get it .
the ribs were good though limited side options .
it is way , way way overrated .
is a pretty simple dish made from a cheap cut of meat .
the accompanying mashed potatoes were just okay .
we arrived 6pm friday night and had a short , _num_ minute wait .
they only take reservations for _num_ or more .
steak was flavorless and the chicken fried steak was tough .
this place was horrible .
very disappointed .
ordered the chili on top of the chicken fried steak .
first the biscuit was just a little bigger than a silver dollar .
never was asked if i wanted a refill on my tea .
my steak came out and was not cooked the way i asked .
the steak had no flavor and was just covered in butter .
she just said ok and walked away .
the problem was the disrespectful treatment we ended up receiving from the manager .
there were _num_ of us .
i found the steak to be tender but bland .
we had _num_ in the party and the server was sharon .
will not be returning or recommending this place to anyone .
it was terrible .
there was absolutely no salt on anything and no flavor .
seriously their `` fries '' were not even salted .
the beef back ribs were n't very good either .
this goes for all aquarium products over $ _num_ .
crappy !
at least not the good , trusted team .
i will not recommend or use this location again .
there was not even mention that she had been very difficult .
forget special orders : those ca n't be accommodated any longer .
despite that being pointed out by several people , nothing changes .
service here tends to be slow .
so leave me alone its my money and my fish .
really do n't like to shop here unless i have to .
something just did n't sit well with me after that .
must not want my service !
avoid this grooming salon .
i wo n't be going back .
i do n't trust them with my dog .
i do n't really come to this location unless i really have to .
the customer service here sucks .
for me , i needed to have the mint mint chocolate chocolate chip .
so , we get there and they are out of brownies .
unfortunately , my second choice would have needed brownies , too !
i just did n't feel welcome .
i will never go back to a cold stone again .
hoping they 'd notice i would like to be helped .
neither of them greeted me or asked me what i wanted yet .
as they walked to the back , i moved up the case .
the male employee said `` whatever '' and walked away .
i guess the service is only nice with select employees at that store .
employees here do n't seem to care .
there were _num_ young kids working at the time .
neither of them seemed to want to help me .
the entire experience was just a mess .
i really would not recommend this location to anyone .
it 's unbelievable how horrible this customer service was .
ok , first time i was here was for lunch .
some of these reviews almost made me vomit ... almost .
kind of a depressing dive bar - not really my kind of hangout .
if i liked the burger , i 'd recommend only ordering it to go .
i went with a patty melt , and was not impressed .
the darker and older the better .
actual shit , as in a piece of crap .
small creatures called chickens .
so i strongly advise against eating here .
the drinks here however are very cheap .
it 's quite sad .
her cheeseburger was over cooked and dry .
my wings were charred and dry .
wait staff asked how it was and i told her `` overcooked '' .
make sure you have _num_ minutes to wait for your average tasting burger .
it 's your typical dark , old and average dive bar .
in _num_ this place was outdated .
i was totally displeased with this place .
this place is misleading .
order the lunch special and _num_ other customers get served before me .
wait _num_ minutes then get up to leave .
do not recommend .
been coming here for years and probably will be coming here for years ahead .
my boyfriend hated the place .
he hated the food and hated the server .
she was n't attentive at all .
the wings were chewy , which means they deep fried frozen wings .
the same lady who cooked my burger before , was working the grill .
( ew . )
just sad .
went here to try the highly recommended wine burger .
the place itself is very dark inside .
they did have good drink specials but it 's not somewhere i 'll return .
just do n't do it .
i went with some co-workers for lunch .
my chicken patty came out like a brick .
it hurt my teeth to bite into .
i got sick from it as well .
it was my first and my last visit to this establishment .
just do n't do it .
she told me i was wrong and refused to believe me .
absolutely unbelievable .
it was a complete and total waste of my time .
horrible company .
i 'm a thrift store junkie and this particular goodwill location is just junkie .
it 's pretty disorganized and the selection is very ... tired ?
yeah , tired .
i get that thrift stores sell used stuff .
this goodwill is a disgusting , stinky , disorganized , picked over mess .
i did n't buy anything .
very sad that nothing is there anymore .
wrong .
this library is just plain depressing .
i 'm sorry .
my impression in that _num_ seconds was enough to send me packing .
gross .
they seem to mess up on special orders so beware ... .
place is dirty too .
does n't seem like they have a manager there anymore .
when across the street to chipotle and never going back .
i was just very unimpressed .
horrible customer service .
showed no effort in helping or listening to anyone .
went to the er having a bad reaction to a medication .
check in girl was fucking rude !
excuse you ?
i 'm not the one who put you as a check in person .
such a weird experience .
probably should expect to spend your entire day here .
your front end people need training in good customer service .
i suggest to all who received bad treatment to report it .
as a sushi place , this is awful .
i 've been here _num_ times and its mediocre at best .
sake selection is small , _num_ or _num_ low end choices .
our server was pretty young and confused about the whole serving profession .
ten minutes pass as tables around us get hovering attention .
we , however , were n't even offered drinks .
sorry , but i was n't impressed .
this place is disgusting !
my california rolls did not even looked like ones .
lunch menu was way too small for the price .
the fish themselves are atrocious and taste like they 've had better days .
my response ... `` yes , by not ordering anymore . ''
no raw salmon ?
am i at a bagel place or a sushi restaurant ?
slow service .
bland miso .
no raw salmon .
enough said , i wo n't be back .
i hate to be an asshole , but i hated this place .
are you kidding me ?
no big deal .
i 'm sorry , is n't it your job to accommodate patrons ?
star removal # _num_ .
star removal # _num_ .
star removal # _num_ .
p.s .
start to finish , lunch took _num_ hours .
fail .
for my entree , i got the sesame chicken with brown rice .
it was ok but a little tad sweeter than i like .
i knocked them down to four stars because the service was terrible .
she never refilled drinks or come back to check on the table .
pad thai sounded yummy and ordered chicken added to the dish .
the manager said , '' of course , sorry . ''
but we were actually insulted !
food was good , service was lousy .
the service was bad .
the table next to us was left dirty for our entire meal .
also , took about _num_ minutes to get the check .
a sushi restaurant that does n't carry raw salmon ?
wish i could them better , but not impressed .
unfortunately , they do n't have great sushi .
we arrived at moto and were seated promptly at a table by the bar .
our ice teas were low and she never offered to refill them .
he informed us she put it in but it was n't up yet .
we were absolutely confused and asked the bartender about our order .
on top of that we missed our movie and just decided to go home .
they are neither .
yeah , i want to eat there ; where the women cry .
i 'm not kidding .
it 's the only way not to be disappointed .
you can tell it is n't fresh fish and never taste super .
lame !
one star is too many for this place .
we just went for the first time tonight .
our waitress was slow and lazy .
the sushi is cheap and skimpy , spring rolls were bland .
we said `` no '' because nothing was good .
we will not be back .
no idea how this place stays open .
but their service can be really bad .
they said they could n't guarantee to have it ready in an hour .
so , i hung up and wo n't be doing that again .
i 've lost my patience with moto .
service was incredibly slow .
i was n't amazingly impressed , but i was n't disappointed , either .
some of the prices seem steep .
slightly loud , but you could still hear each other talk .
no huge loss here .
we probably wont go back .
mediocre to the max with bad service to boot !
the service is probably the worst part .
the food is pretty horrible too .
unfortunately , none of this matters because i got food poisoning .
worst _num_ hours of my life .
it left a bad taste in my mouth .
stopped in here for lunch one day and was n't pleased with the experience .
the rolls were warm and fell apart .
it had more cucumber then tuna and forgot the cream cheese and avocado .
i will never go anywhere near moto again after this experience .
place is garbage , over priced , with lousy service .
just an awful place .
completely flavorless .
add the fact that they charge $ _num_ makes it even worse .
meatballs were rubbery , sliced beef dry and chewy .
owners need to consider taking this off the menu .
gross , gross gross ... .
but every time i go i leave feeling a little disappointed with my meal .
service was horrible , we ended up walking out .
unfortunately , that was the only positive to this experience .
b ) there was a _num_ % gratuity included in the bill .
i was excited to try a new sushi place and normally really love sushi .
not at moto .
sushi was average & choices extremely limited .
drinks watered down .
we have been loyal customers of moto for years .
unfortunately , the services is inconsistent .
before our food arrived , we asked for the bill to cancel our order .
an hour after walking in the door , we still did n't have noodles .
the waitress walked by _num_ or seven times and was avoiding making eye contact .
worst pho i have ever had !
the single most disgusting sushi experience i 've ever had .
$ _num_ down the toilet .
not impressed my last visit .
ordered lunch togo , i was craving the chicken salad .
service was good , which is why it gets _num_ stars .
i sat at the sushi bar and waited _num_ minutes before anyone acknowledged me .
_num_ min later i finally get a drink .
they really need a second chef to help with the sushi .
they were n't attentive and it was really a sub par experience at best .
sushi is sloppy , not creative , and poor cuts of fish .
i sent the following to the management at moto on july _num_ .
she was told no .
in an empty restaurant .
i came away unhappy with your business practice .
do n't waste your money on a subpar restaurant .
there were _num_ tables including ours .
it took over _num_ minutes to get water on the table .
and every time i come here the service gets worse .
it was _num_ minutes before the `` birthday girl '' received her dinner .
does n't say much about the owners or management .
the food and service is going downhill .
last night entrees arrived _num_ minutes apart .
apparently they do n't talk to each other .
sushi is okay but a little over priced .
service is n't the best either .
how this place has even _num_ stars i will never understand .
the waiters pretty much ignore you once you are seated .
do n't like how the food tastes ?
both the presentation and the flavor seriously left something to be desired .
however , i ate here yesterday and experienced the worst customer service .
half and hour later nothing had changed .
i was forced to walk to an atm and take cash out .
i will never return and i will never recommend .
by far the worst customer service i 've received .
the cool kids in the office like moto , i want to like moto .
they burned my wings .
they are overcooked .
however last week we had terrible service !
i just ordered it anyway and low and behold it was not very good .
this was not much past _num_ .
it was just gross .
how disappointing !
_num_ 1/2 hrs for lunch really ?
the food was n't that flavorful .
haha i could n't stop looking at it during dinner .
after the anniversary party i just ca n't take it anymore .
very disappointed .
sushi had way too much rice ( some nearly inedible ) .
not what we were expecting ... with a $ _num_ bill .
the worst ... that 's all i can say .
tried spicy tuna , philly , chicken wings , chow mien .
it was all really bad .
horrible .
server was indifferent .
there was a bone in my salmon sashimi .
no plans to return .
this was by far my worst experience ever at a supposed sushi restaurant .
pretty standard fare and definitely nothing too exotic .
the spicy yellowtail was even worse .
needless to say , avoid this place if you have any respect for yourself .
the owners are awful people .
our experience was offensive .
worst sushi in town .
bad service .
what a waste of a date night !
worst customer service i 've ever experienced .
but the food did disappoint .
the first visit was mediocre at best , mostly due to poor service .
very , disappointed !
calamari was also undercooked , a mixture of soggy and rubbery .
know the menu , attentive and personable without being fake and obnoxious .
it 's july , it 's miserable i get it .
they were understaffed , but hey , it 's summer in az .
things slow down .
or just an unhappy man on a mission to ruin everyone 's night .
not appropriate , and unprofessional .
it was unprofessional and a poor example of what i assume would be management ?
normally , i would give _num_ stars to moto .
how inappropriate and out of line .
the manager or supervisor was very rude .
obvious she did not like dogs .
i do n't want to go back there again .
i responded with i know corporate , i was a partner for _num_ years .
a lot of stores are not gold standard .
not impressed at all .
terrible location .
i waited _num_ min and the drink came out absolutely disgusting .
could n't even drink it .
just a disgusting location .
effing gross .
gross gross gross .
people bring in their stupid ( non service ) dogs all the time .
they do n't seem to give a crap about anyone else .
people bring in their stupid dogs all the time .
they do n't seem to give a crap about anyone else .
when speaking to the staff , they do n't seem to care .
the owner of the dog did n't look the least bit concerned .
this store is totally unorganized .
i walked in around 10:30 am to a short line .
additionally , the taste of my beverage was absolutely horrible .
i was quite disappointed and do not plan on ever going back .
but no , not this guy .
there was a small couch on clearance .
no comment coming from her .
there was none left in that style that i liked .
now they seem to be so disorganized and sloppy in their work .
no need to come back .
pharmacy : they only have _num_ person staffing this location .
takes more than _num_ minutes to fill a rx .
this place has the worst customer service !
i use the one on 7th st and mcdowell and never run into this .
he does not !
i go to pay & the charge me for gel !
i tell them that ryan did n't use the gel just the polish .
well hello thats not gel .
after _num_ hours i get to go back tomorrow what joy !
do n't get ryan .
the biggest issue i have is not the customer service .
i went to tiffany 's nails for a gel manicure .
i would not go back to tiffany 's nail salon for a gel manicure .
poor customer service !
expensive and does a poor job !
this particular time however , an older lady did my nails .
she filed the top of them leaving them scratched and very thin .
the finished product looked like something i would try to do at home .
so my first experience with ulta was ok .
ugh .
i would consider the shopping experience here a small step up from walgreens .
i 'm always bummed out when i walk around .
as for the staff , ca n't stand them .
nope , not ulta .
this is probably the worst ulta when it comes to customer service .
this is not the case at this location .
if it is , then they are doing stellar !
i thought the women who worked here were completely useless .
the points are a waste .
spend hundreds of dollars for a free hair brush ?
i wanted to try something different and was excited to try some new makeup .
needless to say i 'll be taking my money to another store .
terrible service by the sales staff on the floor of the store .
finally , the parking here sucks .
otherwise use the ulta in chandler for better parking .
too bad ulta !
i mean , i did have the exact product i wanted to purchase .
but from the moment i walked it , i felt invisible .
during my wait there though , i happened to stumble upon the product .
come on -- i had to look confused .
i 'm some dude at ulta who does n't belong in ulta .
this store is a mess .
wrong .
it was gross .
only one cashier handling a long line of people waiting to check out .
i 'd rather drive to sephora to get my overpriced shampoo .
staff ... ... ... not the best .
my eyebrows looked a hot mess .
i ended up buying the eye brow paint we originally tried .
so staff sucks .
the employees are too busy talking to each other to provide customer service .
but then i could n't find anyone .
you have failed me , camelback ulta .
it just is n't worth the hassle .
i wish i could give _num_ stars .
horrible job .
however they offered to `` fix '' it at a later date .
no thank you .
thank you ulta for a horrible start to my birthday weekend .
i have been to many ulta locations and this is the worst .
the cash wrap is always about _num_ people deep on weekends .
i rarely come to this location and i probably wo n't return .
the woman that was following me could 've asked !
terrible store , terrible service will not return !
i do n't know what it is about this location .
when i arrived at the store it was relatively empty .
it was a rainy day and not many shoppers were out .
she did not offer her help either .
there was complete silence from her as she continue to ring my sale .
i could n't let this one go .
the associates are never around when i need to ask a question .
wandering around the sections of the store , clearly confused .
and i did n't get any help .
ok , no problem .
well after spending almost _num_ hours there i was less than pleased .
i have very thick hair and it is very hard to cut .
after she dried my hair i could n't tell the difference .
i had her re trim several areas that looked very uneven .
i just wanted to get out of there , so i paid and left .
no one asked us for help and no one was really around .
it is impossible to run in there quickly to pick something up .
downhill .
over the last few years , it 's slowly been going downhill .
their signature italian beef sandwiches are often served barely warm or cold .
i am still searching for the ultimate italian beef sandwich .
can anyone help ( er , `` yelp '' ) me ?
just seems too high for a couple of sandwiches .
hey , i could have gone to capital grill for not that much more .
beef was somewhat bland today .
is that what they called those pickled jalapenos they put on their sandwich ?
this place is sub-par at best !
do n't waste your time !
i am leaving this review to remind myself to not waste my time .
i was a long time customer and left the area ten years ago .
bun was average - not fresh and not stale - unremarkable ... .
it was hard to open the package and the packaging was hot !
tasted as expected but the process to get to it turned me off .
i really wanted to give _num_ star , but the beef was good .
got _num_ italian roast beef sandwiches and fries .
lousy service , mediocre proportions vs others around , no fresh cut fries !
even my mom could n't believe how rude he was .
chicago hamburger company was better .
philadelphia sandwich company was better , kinda .
luke 's does , but in a bad way .
twice if not 3x more meat .
owner or whoever was at the counter was extremely rude .
this is no al 's beef ( unfortunately the one in scottsdale closed ) .
luke 's italian beef is dry and lackluster in flavor .
very disappointed .
zero stars if i could .
good lord , has this place gone downhill .
you 're rude , lazy and a downright tool .
the bathroom looked like it had n't been cleaned in weeks .
i 'll spend my _num_ bucks where i 'm appreciated .
she introduced me to italian beef and is a native of chicago .
showed up one saturday and the place is empty and up for lease .
not everyone 's big on small talk .
none offered .
then he remembers that i still need to sign off on the receipt .
i get my food , and leave .
bad service , i 'm hoping the food at least makes up for it .
people , i 'm from chicago .
thing is , it 'll be about $ _num_ .
i am not sure what 's up with the owner .
time for luke to thrown in the towel or make some big changes .
we wo n't be going back there again .
i would not recommend it to anyone .
better dogs at costco .
unfortunately , it is no longer there .
since moving to phoenix , we ca n't find a good one .
this one came very close , but the owners attitude sucks .
_num_ bucks for _num_ of them .
this guy is crazy for charging such a price .
i was excited to try this place since i often drive by .
i was very disappointed .
the beer battered zucchini rings were over salted .
the meatball sub was over priced ( $ _num_ ) and lackluster .
the italian beef sandwich had good beef but was very dry .
i do not recommend this place , the food was not the best either .
ate there awhile back and will not be back .
food was terrible and way overpriced .
no more .
very rude and uncaring .
the food is exact opposite of chicago food .
the overall experience has kept me from going back .
i hate to even give this place a star but i have no choice .
we walked in and we were not greeted .
they never bothered to come back to the phone for _num_ minutes !
what a waste of time and money .
totally disappointed !
chicago style toppings were right but felt like a cold smoked sausage not polish .
kept wanting to drive back and let them know .
do n't have a grill ?
it worked too !
unfortunately , that 's what i go to a restaurant for , the food .
it seems like everything was marinated in oil then deep fried .
i guess that made up for the mediocre food .
just awful .
this place is nothing to write home about .
fries are not so great .
the sauce was yummy but i 'm angry about the wing size !
i want so much to write a glowing review here but no .
i tried one , and eventually my friend let me have the last _num_ .
i think jack in the box could 've put out a better product overall .
poorly .
worst diner ever !
waste of money , waste of time , waste of space .
i will not go back , ever .
not just at this 16th street location but at all _num_ & diners .
it was a saturday night but wasnt too busy .
entire outside seating was available and a few booths inside were empty .
ordered the bacon cheeseburger , nothing fancy .
so half of the burger was cooked through and the other half was pink .
the sunday came out with almost no hot fudge on it .
so i ordered a bacon cheeseburger , pretty basic , no special instructions .
when i got it , it was half cooked .
i am not sure how that happens .
service was slow .
i was overwhelmed by the choices .
i went with lunch during breakfast time .
there 's a dead fly in my fruit cup .
i mean , i do n't know what else they could 've said .
once we ordered i just assumed that everything would remedy itself .
server rule # _num_ - never make your problem , their problem !
do i think that we deserved as much attention as anyone else there tonight ?
did we catch them on a bad night ?
about the only thing i can eat is the potatoes .
ick .
the person at the front taking names and seating people was downright rude .
yes , she was young and ignorant , but she still acted badly .
uh , rude .
needless to say i will not be going back there ever again .
absolutely waste of time & space is this establishment .
not my first time here , definitely my last .
no discount , no nothing .
_num_ and diner is a diner , i do n't expect _num_ stars .
at best , hit and miss .
food - not so good .
i 've eaten here twice for breakfast .
the second time i got california eggs benedict - big mistake .
the hollandaise sauce was disgusting , and did not look like hollandaise .
terrible in that my overpriced grilled cheese had _num_ small pieces of cheese .
she offered to make me another one but i was not interested .
for two pieces of bread and _num_ small pieces of cheese !
this is the third time in a row where the steak just sucked .
carlos told me he tells his boss but nothing changes .
makes denny 's like like it deserves _num_ stars .
i ordered an eggs benedict , and the sauce over it was frankly inedible .
my wife 's special scramble was equally bad .
my _num_ year old son did like his kid 's meal .
but they did n't , and i wo n't be back .
damn shame .
the taste of the food was off .
my son 's shake was n't blended all the way .
mediocre chain diner with around denny 's quality or slightly lower food .
it was gross .
what kids do n't deserve a decent meal ?
so me and my husband came in last night , it was pretty busy .
i would n't have came back if it was that bad .
it tasted like cardboard .
which is everything to me , other than what you are paying for .
had some high hopes for this one .
well , my wife and i just left disappointed .
we probably wo n't be coming back here again .
instead of onion rings they gave me fries .
still not a big deal , but getting a little irritated .
the sauce on it was horrible she said .
the only redeeming quality of this place was the shake .
my chicken sandwich was n't anything to write home about , but edible .
the only saving grace of this place was the shake .
like i said before , we probably wo n't be coming back .
disappointed that our visit was n't better .
the food was horrible !
i ordered the chicken strips and fries and both were cold and gross .
strips were really hard as well .
overall the food was a big turn off , we will not be returning .
just a disgusting plate to eat !
two people coast _num_ .
the food was cheap in taste .
the milkshakes were _num_ % milk and _num_ % ice cream .
both times , the meat was overcooked and dry .
ca n't recommend .
the small amount of macaroni cheese old .
friendly server , but i wo n't be back .
so horrible just left the restaurant they served me raw chicken strips !
like dead ass raw chicken strips not even half way cooked .
we just walked out of this establishment after waiting _num_ minutes for service .
at _num_ minutes we complained and at that point we were served drinks .
_num_ minutes later , we were still completely ignored .
at that point i carried our menus in and explained why we were leaving .
manager , move out from behind the counter and serve your customers .
i 'm totally disgusted with this place tonight .
manager , you should be ashamed .
ridiculous .
where 's my meatloaf !
i ordered chicken tenders and cheese sticks to go at 11:30 .
it now was cold , and my lunch hour was over .
last night , my husband and _num_ brothers came in at 11pm .
we not greeted by our server , _num_ different servers walked past us .
we sat for _num_ min , and left .
this was the worst service i 've ever had .
i expressed my concern to him as we walked out the door .
i 've shopped here before .
customer service was not that great .
rude lady would n't go back in ever .
she 's very condescending sounding .
tanks are way overpriced .
do n't let online pictures fool you !
for the price they are asking there are several better options in the area .
if you have a pet , do n't live here .
your dog will escape because he 's confused and scared .
the big king did not live up to it 's name .
it was actually kind of a pathetic looking sandwich .
unfortunately that 's exactly what happened this past saturday .
apparently that threw the kid totally off .
this set me off .
give me my correct change , and i will get my own damn napkins .
i only go here because i only get a _num_ min .
but they always get my order wrong .
i was so embarrassed .
and today , i ordered fries and onion rings with no salt .
my fries and onion rings are covered in salt .
save your money and time , do n't go here .
i live down the road and they consistently serve old , soggy fries !
it is so unhealthy and gross !
the chicken there is n't even real .
slow .
wrong order and did n't ask if i wanted cream and sugar .
flies everywhere , place is dirty and food not cooked well .
Negative
if i could give this restaurant negative stars i would !
mcdonalds service has gone so down hill and managers do n't care .
never going back .
the cashier did not even apologize for the wait .
very disappointed .
they got my order wrong .
badly .
i just do n't get it .
this place is horrible !
this place is horrible !
good luck trying to get _num_ $ an hr for what you do .
thumbs down !
so i spent about $ _num_ that night .
i walked out and my friend asked what did i get .
so watch your bags !
and i 've worked in retail , really lame employees and actions that night .
get the hell over yourself !
and that 's it , she cut me off .
are you kidding me ?
do not ever go here , this place is a nightmare .
and that 's it , she cut me off .
are you kidding me ?
do not ever go here , this place is a nightmare .
too expensive .
no bread .
also cold .
no bread , no pita bread .
my experience was horrible .
it has apparently not changed in that many years .
it was overly spiced , and drowned in sauce .
there was no taste of salmon to be found .
the whole ordeal came to about $ _num_ plus tip .
i wo n't be back .
do not waste youre time going here !
i really do n't have anything bad to say about them surprisingly .
and my bill would not have been _num_ $ .
this place is a joke and nothing like authentic greek food .
enter stage left , a host .
it was dry and not tasty .
nothing to really yelp about .
it was the absolute worse that i have ever experienced .
i was extremely disappointed .
it was pretty bad .
the rest of the food was ok but very pricey given the portions .
none of it was good .
service is totally crap .
if you 're handicapped you are screwed one parking space for the whole building .
this was n't all that impressive .
calamari was mediocre - definitely had much better elsewhere .
my meal was awful .
he did however take a long time to bring the bill .
ultimately i would probably go back but i might try other places first .
there were other issues that unfortunately you were not aware of .
i do n't know how this is the best greek in phoenix .
everything did n't taste like it should .
will not be coming back here .
our drinks ran dry and the service was terrible .
i will not be back .
extremely disappointed !
wow i feel sorry for this place .
the place was empty , only one other table .
this is just a depressing store .
it 's not fancy .
it 's not particularly clean .
the staff is n't particularly friendly , nor is the service anything amazing .
and i was charged $ _num_ for a natural nail french tip ?
but , i really have n't .
i would like to rate the work here , but sadly i ca n't .
i waited for _num_ minutes and they never opened .
i wo n't give them a chance to waste my time again .
unless you have time to waste , do n't go to this nail salon .
do not go to this place !
horrible job !
i would give it a zero star if i could .
would not recommend to anyone .
terrible service !
i sat for _num_ minutes watching people with appointments get served .
none of the techs were in the least bit friendly or personable .
it was horrible .
i 'd recommend you just skip this place .
and they 'd never rip my nails off like that .
not worth my time nor money .
service is bad .
not sure why they take appointments if they will take walk-ins first .
hit or miss here .
tonight , pedi was okay and mani was awful .
they refunded me for the manicure , at least .
techs are rude .
the service is very inconsistent and this will be my last time going today .
this was by far the worst mani pedi i 've had : ( .
i will not be a returning customer .
waited _num_ minutes they forgot about us we waited .
_num_ more minutes and they were super rude .
i 've been here once before and the pedi was ok .
have now taken _num_ customers ahead of me .
_num_ minutes !
not a thorough pedicure what 's so ever .
nobody was waiting after me .
i will not be going back .
i walk in , order my flat bread , sit down and bam !
i went here a couple of times and was dissapointed every single time .
the obvious question is `` why then do you continue to go back ? ''
usually i leave feeling like a fool for falling for it once again .
poured most of it down the drain instead .
nasty stuff .
i wait .
this location , however , leaves a lot to be desired .
this last visit really made me mad .
the store seems to stay fairly busy in the morning hours .
either way , i 've made my final visit .
i can get a hot drink elsewhere .
service has been only okay all three times we came here .
also , $ _num_ for egg , cheese and a bagel ?
too much .
i ate 1/2 and threw it away and never complained .
but , things have recently gone downhill .
next time ill just come earlier .
i like your bagels !
einstein , what is it you make ?
really _num_ minutes ?
wtf einstein 's i did n't go there to buy cream cheese .
i wo n't bother to stop again .
hello fellow yelpers !
i feel like i 'm on a middle school campus when i 'm there .
ordered a thin bagel toasted .
asked for potato salad for my side , received fruit .
literally some of the most incompetent people working here .
also their restrooms are disgusting .
too bad this place has worst service !
literally yesterday i walked in .
this store needs to get to it together .
nothing complicated .
then why why did why did i why did i pay for that ?
and i wait _num_ minutes to find this out ?
paid a _num_ cent up charge for the special bagel i did n't get .
ok i might be picky .
the next day no one could find it .
it is awful .
service is not good .
service here is awful .
i would n't recommend this place at all .
she refused to acknowledge that maybe she was wrong .
just insisted that i had said delmonico .
but i do n't recommend the place .
we were extremely disappointed .
not this time .
the sauted mushrooms were particularly disappointing .
sorry , lone star .
steak was not cooked properly .
.
horrible .
this review is from june _num_ , _num_ .
drinks were fair , service mediocre , atmosphere boring and smelled like old people .
no salmon there when i went .
overpriced , mediocre food .
$ _num_ for a store bought slice of apple pie that was so tiny .
i meal prep so i make sure i have the correct portions .
i should n't have to drive back because of their mistake .
the food tasted reheated ; that 's the only way to describe it .
reheated in the microwave is what it tasted like and it tasted old .
the baked potato should n't taste like that .
i have had better baked potatoes from my microwave and this was bad .
my meat was over cooked and not seasoned well at all .
my boyfriend stated that it was under par for him as well .
been here lots and this was n't the best .
just paid $ _num_ for a ribeye that i just could n't eat .
i cut a bite of steak off and tasted it .
not bad however , a bit over done .
she gave me a _num_ % discount on the steak only .
the food and service were poor at best .
the only thing worth a cent is the mac and cheese .
do n't waist your money on this place .
not good for vegetarians .
in addition , every time i eat there i get sick .
food quality is poor and is on par with taco bell .
they actually tasted more like cereal than tortilla chips .
our server barely spoke english and barely seemed to notice we were there .
he ordered guacamole with his and i asked for sour creme with mine .
all in all -- nothing overwhelming , including the food .
other than `` spicy '' -- there were no particularly memorable or enjoyable flavors .
maybe it was just an off night for me .
not impressed at all .
no flavor !
the fish was grilled , but i could barely taste it .
i doubt i 'd go back there .
the layout of the establishment is also really weird .
but this is n't a place you 'd want that kind of attention .
we want spicy , cheesy goodness .
but really the lack of service will prevent us from coming back .
the rest of the meal is bland .
i wo n't go back .
please do n't waste your money .
this is such a poor example of no service and bad food .
the service was awful and the wait was too long .
also i was not to impressed with any of the food that day .
this place was just okay for me .
save yourself a lot of aggravation and disappointment and go somewhere else .
stole money from us , admit to it and refuse to make it right .
no wonder they are about to lose their business .
i immediately noticed that it looked like it needed a deep cleaning .
this really turned my stomach .
visited the gilbert restaurant tonight at 7pm .
after _num_ minutes without food ( _num_ adult meals and a kids meal .
manager said he would check on it and be back to me .
he never returned to me to check on us .
_num_ minutes later , our food was delivered .
no one apologized or explained why our food took so long .
if you are looking for tasteless mexican this is your place .
no rice or beans and our bill was $ _num_ !
walking in was not to expectations .
me & boyfriend stopped in after work , sat in the bar .
drinks come & the beer is half ass cold , jim was fine .
its ok , i 'm mexican i can say this shit !
you want mexican , tons of other places .
skip this place , overpriced .
gross .
this place is a disgrace to mexican food .
very low budget !
today 's experience was awful !
we 're not dumb .
not impressed .
atmosphere is blah .
just nothing special .
it 's as if they threw it in the microwave for _num_ minutes .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
hands down the most aweful margarita i have had in my life .
do yourself a favor and skip this place .
there are a ton of awesome restaurants in phoenix .
my rating used to be _num_ stars , but this place quickly went downhill .
it was almost all salsa water , or whatever it is .
i just had the absolute worst experience ever at a restaurant at this location .
the bad part was the food .
the worst part was the service .
i told her she was rude and disrespectful .
her only reply was that they have problems with people leaving without paying .
service here sucks our waiter martin who goes by jesus was not welcoming .
salsa was horrible .
very annoying .
terrible experience .
ok first off the decor made me feel dirty .
i ordered a shredded beef taco and my wife got the chicken con queso .
jar was the size a side of sour cream would come in .
rice was very bland .
the cream cheese sauce was kinda weak in the flavor department .
chips and salsa were ok .
i ordered some of their hot sauce and it was chunky like their salsa .
the decor had a layer of dust all over it .
it felt very _num_ inside .
it made me sick to have to touch it to pay .
my last visit was terrible .
served moldy tasting chips in a dirty bowl .
the beef enchilada had fatty pieces in it .
other than that nothing was worth eating .
if all u want is cheap this is your place .
this was no big deal to them .
gross !
nothing special .
the food was ok , but the atmosphere and service was less than stellar .
it was a chicken sandwich and was missing it 's main condiment to boot .
now the bank gets to duke it out with the restaurant .
it was offensive .
i should 've taken the hint then .
there wo n't be a third .
disappointing .
burger was cooked properly but lean and dry .
le slaw was bland and chili was essentially pork and beans without the pork .
just not great food .
my chicken was overcooked .
my wasabi mashed potatoes were tasty although there was no hint of wasabi whatsoever .
i had a mandarin mule that was okay but not great .
all in all , not a great experience .
bartender was rude as could be .
clearly annoyed when we had a question about our bill .
if only zero star was available .
i am allergic to diet soda .
not here .
there is an older waiter who is rude and inconsiderate .
i will spend my money elsewhere ... .
terrible service .
she was awful i would n't recommend this place to anyone .
it just is n't worth it .
a very unimpressive meal today for breakfast .
and your employees are brain dead .
why do n't you put that in your back pocket ?
the worst best buy i 've ever been to .
and what ever you do do n't let anthony touch your vehicle !
this issue was covered under the extra plan i purchased .
worst best buy ever .
treating customers like crap just because someone asks if they can buy something ?
employees are rude and mostly brain dead at this store .
the manager of this store needs to be fired .
ok has been _num_ months since my _num_ star rating .
big mistake .
this is not the place to buy any gps or gps accessories .
customer service here is terrible .
guy working there would n't accept my tv even though it was under warranty .
not worth the hassle to go here .
the main tv salesman straight up refused to help me .
anyways , i do not like best buy .
mid day , mid week , store pretty empty .
_num_ employees hanging around the camera department as i started to look at options .
i think i have it , i 'm ready to select .
they were just gone .
i could n't possibly stop them all .
i am not surprised that this store is the lowest rated in the area .
excuse me , i have a return .
mgr : i 'm sorry .
we do not take returns over _num_ days .
mgr yes , but you did show it to me .
i looked around with a customer service rep , who was in fact friendly .
in short , i have no problem with the customer service at this location .
this store however has been terrible .
i brought my laptop here to get repaired on thursday .
not a big fan of best buy .
they are over priced and staff is not helpful .
today was sadly no different .
we now return to our regular scheduled program , customer service _num_ .
what a nightmare !
lo and behold they have _num_ in stock .
at this point i did n't know that it was the wrong player .
best buy has the worst customer service and they do n't care .
lame .
client service is awful .
real qualified manager if u do n't know the policies .
purchased over _num_ laptop out of state .
i ca n't believe how dishonest this company is .
customer service is extremely lacking .
do not buy geek squad insurance .
it 's $ _num_ .
this _num_ star goes to geek squad .
they wo n't steer you in the wrong direction .
lame !
i wo n't take a risk buying from best buy again .
i pay for tech support ... but they are n't much support at all .
_num_ .
my phone was worthless .
_num_ .
as for best buy , i would probably never go back .
selection sucks .
not sure why .
do n't even get me started about the geek joke at these locations .
geek squad are terrible and know about as much as a door nail .
worst customer service ever .
this location has terrible customer service .
shady business trying to get rid of old stock .
i asked an employee for help ; he sent me to the geek squad .
_num_ , i think .
the cover cost $ _num_ and they insisted on charging $ _num_ to install .
the second one they installed had a bubble underneath .
if it does n't , come back and they 'll install a third cover .
that 'll be another wasted _num_ minutes ... no thanks .
try not to come here .
so he was helpful , it just took _num_ minutes to get that help .
if i could give zero stars i would .
just do n't do it .
but after that , you would 've thought i was invisible .
i wo n't be going back , thank goodness .
he said `` slow down partner , in here to help .
he could have just waited a few minutes and then sold me a laptop .
just poor customer service from this guy .
avoid them at all costs .
they are sketchy and i would not recommend doing business with them .
they are less expensive and so much better !
poor customer service would actually work out , we got no customer service .
finally , she looked at my account and saw that i had canceled .
she was going to fix the problem right away .
man what a mess !
: ( ( ( never had this happen with previous owner !
hmm i do n't think so , nor did my vet .
you would have known had you followed up as you said you would .
i was not impressed and left really missing our groomer back in ca .
pretty disappointed will not be returning .
terrible customer service .
actually , no service at all .
looks like they got my dog wet but did n't clean him at all .
if you want to get what you pay for , take your pup elsewhere .
wish i could have wrote a better review about this place .
i 'll spend my hard earned money else where thank you .
very disappointed in my order .
the bill was $ _num_ .
just like everything else , there was no presentation at all .
i would not use them again .
they are not my first choice .
it 's just disappointing .
would n't recommend .
she does n't care about her customers .
i did not feel like i was helped here at all .
when customer service is everything this store is nothing !
wish i would have gotten their names .
two is n't really that many !
the mattress is n't that great either !
we purchased a high end mattress that was delivered on may _num_ , _num_ .
very poor customer service .
what a complete and utter nightmare .
Negative
if i could give negative stars i would .
recently purchased a car here .
do not let the initial welcoming manner fool you .
words of advise ... stay away from these people .
no problem , i 'll just take it to get taken care of .
i asked for a break in the price , to no avail .
i thought ok , my fault for not looking at the mileage .
this was n't his first time towing this vehicle .
i ask for jason , he still is n't in .
i feel like i am being avoided .
no sir .
i was n't willing to get out of the car .
how difficult could this to be to make .
consistently , they are terrible at this one particular starbucks .
i thought i was going to die without my caffeine fix .
i do n't understand why after the service i got .
wow , i have never received such crappy service in my life .
sometimes these people forget what they do and who they work for .
avoid this location , either go to the on on camelback or _num_ st .
the reason for the _num_ star rating ?
why ca n't they put up a barrier ?
not my favorite starbucks location .
nowhere near a grande .
the drive thru is a nightmare !
the price chart say that children under _num_ are $ _num_ .
i really , really hesitate to write a bad review .
do not recommend .
everyone i know that has ever mentioned the duck tells me they like it .
i really do n't even know where to start with this place .
the decor in this place is cluttered , old , and feels dirty .
i do n't find that particularly appetizing .
wrong .
the french bread was hard as a rock and was way too much bread .
the sun dried tomatoes were huge , but overpowered everything else .
i could n't taste the brie or the prosciutto .
i was very disappointed in the entire experience .
this place is subway quality for way more money .
i thought duck would be great for a quick casual lunch .
turns out , the dark brown layer was actually rotten avocado .
avocado is like prime rib to vegetarians .
it was truly nasty .
there is no flow .
there is no love lost between customers and employees here .
it was empty .
i pulled the full dispenser toward me so i could use it .
apparently , she was unable to provide the effort to move it herself .
there was no trouble finding an empty table outside .
this was not an eight dollar sandwich .
the southwest pasta salad side was ok , but a little too wet .
i probably wo n't go back anytime soon .
we have too many great options today , in central phoenix .
- veggies were fresh and deli meat was meh .
when i open my bag , there is only half a sandwich ?
if i could give them minus _num_ stars , i would do so .
not good .
ambiance a big zero .
on a busy sunday afternoon this is unacceptable .
i ordered a blt on sourdough bread with a side of coleslaw .
she never told them when ordering yo hold the spinach .
i could n't hear or talk to the person sitting right next to me .
i opened my sandwich to find it made incorrectly , yet again .
i reached my breaking point and called asking to speak with a manager .
still not good .
sandwich just not good .
i tried the tuna on white rye .
but the flavors were just not there .
not a fan .
sandwiches were alright , but not worth the price .
also , do n't go here if you have a dog .
it 's kind of hard to find since it 's located near office buildings .
i was looking forward to the smoked duck , but i was disappointed .
the cranberry sauce completely overpowered the meat so that 's all i could taste .
i could only finish half my sandwich and tossed the rest .
after reading good reviews , we thought we 'd try this place out .
unfortunately , it was quite dirty .
after that , the food did not seem quite so appetizing .
unsanitary , disorganized , and poor customer service .
then the same manager opened up the gates on the windows and walked away .
i ended up buying the flat iron thanks to the help of the employee .
ugh .
this is not a high end shopping experience .
this is not a customer focused experience .
they often run out of merchandise .
i 'm not willing to spend any time thinking too hard on this .
it 's not worth it .
manager could n't help either .
so this was a bit of a turn off .
it was dry it fell apart and had a stale and bland flavor .
i want so much to return the crap right back to them .
i was n't impressed with this place .
the workers seemed very rude and the store was kind of dirty .
i ended up leaving empty handed and very , very disappointed .
would n't recommend this place .
i 'd really second guess this daycare .
i dropped off a prescription tuesday evening .
not a `` hi , we 'll be right with you '' nothing .
so i left , extremely upset , without my medication .
i will most likely be going elsewhere next time i need a prescription filled .
then i get a call its ready _num_ minutes later .
so slow .
one cashier and _num_ customers !
worst pharmacy service ever !
messed up my prescription several times this year already .
because it is friday now , the medicine will not arrive until monday .
i need my medicine and nobody seems to care .
i like this cvs because it 's close to home and open _num_ hours .
the store itself is alright .
the problem with this cvs is the pharmacy .
they are a little clueless and some techs are just rude .
i needed this script asap so i killed time in the area .
an hour later it was n't ready .
excuse me ?
my doctor gave me this for a reason !
i was extremely upset at this point and just left .
this is not okay !
now , though , there are new employees and unfair practices .
i 've worked in retail before , and this goes against most store policies .
prepare to be disappointed .
very frustrating experience .
i kept smiling , but they just looked away .
the manager did n't know how to properly take the photo .
my photo looks incredibly pissed off .
overall , annoying experience .
avoid if you can !
the minute clinic is awful .
incredibly rude and inconsiderate .
i did n't notice until i took it and felt funny .
i ended up in the ed with low blood pressure .
this is unfortunate because i have had nothing but horrible customer service experiences here .
that 's not something we offer .
use it for animal medication , as long as it was available .
i called cvs to refill my own prescription .
she really ca n't see my prescription history ?
so i say `` okay '' and wait while she checks .
no apologies for the confusion , nothing .
so , if you have a choice , do n't use this pharmacy !
the pharmacy gave me someone else 's prescription .
going through the drive thru was a very unpleasant experience .
the gal was very rude , slow , and had a horrid attitude .
i 'll stick with the drive-thru from now on .
meanwhile it took _num_ minutes to get my appetizer .
lackluster , boring , unimpressive , less than inspired , and fishy smelling .
the tuna and salmon were pretty much just rice and the mashed fish filling .
probably wo n't be returning anytime soon for happy hour .
we had attended the fish market last night , as a party of _num_ .
the atmosphere is like any other seafood restaurant with a mixed crowd .
service was horrendous and completely changed my attitude about the experience .
we did n't get our food ordered until an hour after being seated .
the presentation was poor , and looked very unappetizing .
the chicken was overcooked , served with bland rice and potatoes .
it was n't worth the money , nor our time .
i wo n't be back .
but it just was n't unique enough or amazing for me .
the same thing happened , but this time the pain was much worst .
at this point i knew that something was n't right .
the prices there are way too high .
unfortunately my first experience at runner 's den was n't good .
had a terrible experience today .
she did n't care and it showed .
i 'll buy them elsewhere .
my husband , kids , friends will never shop there again either .
there were _num_ buffet items that were totally out .
not good since there were only a limited number of items to begin with .
i thought the taste was off , not my type of indian food .
no spice and no heat .
come on , it '' s a buffet and it 's lunch .
nobody has time to wait around for a piece of tandoori chicken .
time has not been kind to flavors of india .
obviously , i 'm going to order the rice .
they need to change the name of this place to nickel and dime .
the fried items can be a bit soggy from sitting out too long .
i feel like there should be a discount at places like this for vegetarians .
but until then , i 'll probably just be staying away .
it just was n't particularly awesome or memorable .
i 'm not sure what 's going on with flavors of india .
the food was okay but the experience was not enjoyable .
i 'm not sure what it was .
dirty and full of roaches .
the rice was dry and crunchy .
the food was of poor quality .
the tomato chicken tasted like beef jerky .
on top of all that the services was horrid .
this was the worst experience ever in a restaurant !
finally , the cockroach fell onto our table .
is this the worst part of the visit ?
the dining area is too dark and the lunch buffet is mediocre .
worst dish !
have went here for dinner before , it was okay but not great .
went to lunch buffet and it 's terrible .
not spicy .
the dishes taste nothing like they should .
if you must eat here , the tandoori chicken is n't bad .
service was poor .
not my choice for a lunch companion !
i guess the thing to remember about this place is to get there early .
if you do n't , you will be waiting for food and _num_ .
really pissed me off that she said that .
the atmosphere is quiet and a little awkward at dinner time .
it is n't really a good value either .
i would recommend taking the food to-go or maybe going at lunch .
this place is a run down dump .
the buffet is over priced .
there are some great indian places in phoenix and this is not one .
the chicken curry was spicy but executed poorly .
if u want it eat otherwise u can leave .
bad restaurant ... .
i asked around the office where i could find some great indian food !
the gentleman who greeted us was pleasant and i assume the owner .
there were a total of _num_ tables being occupied .
we 'd been there _num_ minutes or so now and had n't ordered .
service was friendly but not enough to make us go back .
not happy with this restaurant at all .
unfortunately , the best part of our meal was the plain basmati rice .
i love ginger , but this was so overwhelmingly bad .
i 'd expect so much better after paying $ _num_ bucks .
sucks since this is the closest indian restaurant by far .
if gas stations sold indian food , this is what it would taste like .
the sauce was watery and i am sure it was n't made with yogurt .
the garlic naan was soggy because they drenched it in a buttery sauce .
i love indian food , but this is the worst i ever had .
looks like we are only indian here .
are you kidding me with this office staff ?
the tempe office wait is never less than _num_ minutes .
ridiculous !
can i bill them for wasting my time ?
both were totally incompetent and uncaring .
i 'm only _num_ years old .
pain does n't just come from no where and have no explanation .
pain is not normal , it 's a warning sign that must be addressed .
this was responsible for all of my pain !
both were totally incompetent and uncaring .
i 'm only _num_ years old .
pain does n't just come from no where and have no explanation .
pain is not normal , it 's a warning sign that must be addressed .
this was responsible for all of my pain !
worst physician experience of my life .
got the bill today ... $ _num_ for _num_ minutes !
-no one takes any personal responsibility .
wish i could give them no stars , and get my wasted time back .
did not get too far into the bs .
was on hold for more than _num_ mins to make an appointment .
however , not the top notch service they provided at one time .
good doctors but a mess .
avoid it if at all possible .
wish i had never called them .
had to go to tempe where their office parking situation is a complete nightmare .
i strongly urge others to seek care elsewhere .
he missed the problem area due to poor testing .
oh , he missed my left arm all together .
the staff might make it at the post office ... maybe .
worst customer service ever !
needless to say , i will not return to this office ever again !
so disappointed !
whatever you do make sure to never have him as a doctor .
it 's been a mess .
to be fair i can not speak on any other dr in this establishment .
i hope this saves someone from a mess .
then she was prescribed with pain meds .
she was crying in pain everyday and in the night too .
then he walked out .
like he did not already know her condition from day one .
time to get a clue on customer service !
bad doctors , bad pt staff .
it was n't all bad .
if not for her , i would never go into that bar again .
and she repeated it .
not cool to be stupid drunk in your own bar lady .
the other customers were very nice , the bartender was not .
i had the same experience as dana b below .
not on one occasion ... three .
_num_ ) number one and three .
_num_ ) number two and three .
_num_ ) all of the above .
alright , i 'm done .
do n't waste your time !
my friends and i stopped in on a sunday afternoon ... big mistake !
not very original .
dumb .
other than that , the place is ok for a dive bar .
this was very disappointing since it now fit worse than before .
did n't seem to want to help me.
pretty nice selection though , maybe they had something that would have worked .
oh well ... there are other jewelers in town .
i could n't have imagined a more perfect ring and i absolutely adore it .
customer service was horrific !
too expensive and had my computer for over a month for a simple repair !
horrible experience !
u could find much better places for computer repairs ... .
the whole thing seemed so fishy .
they did n't even start looking at it until i was on my way .
horrible customer service .
once i approved the repairs , it took almost _num_ weeks to fix .
worst experience ever , avoid this place !
i had already paid them the $ _num_ .
i was told that the $ _num_ was to diagnosis the problem .
i refused to pay and will be picking up my computer .
this is not what i wanted .
i did n't have a good feeling about this place .
about four months into the contract i decided it was n't worth it .
below is my outdated review .
i hate danny 's .
over $ _num_ for a crappy detail job .
do n't bother .
the prices are on the high side and it can be quite busy .
that car washing cost me nearly $ _num_ .
of course , danny 's car wash was not responsible .
but wait , there 's more .
i still feel it should get the same attention , especially at $ _num_ .
ok , the owner must be a complete idiot .
lucky me .
everytime i go to this place i wonder why .
no shock at all on the numerous bad reviews for danny 's .
i wish i would have read them before i took my car in .
they stole my change ( probably over _num_ bucks ) .
i was jammed up so she drove straight back .
no surprise the reviews reflect the shitty job they do .
i should n't have to get a manager involved every time .
the car is dirty and i 'm sad .
i did n't buy it .
nothing was there , nor had been for quite some time .
i do n't recommend it really unless you are desperate .
dirty car even after most expensive carwash .
this last time , it really looked like they just vacuumed my car .
also , they are really too expensive for what you get .
so i 'm going to try somewhere else .
getting my car washed there is too much work for me .
danny 's was a _num_ star car wash _num_ years ago !
in the past several years i 've had countless bad experiences .
( average job on the wash then , btw . )
so _num_ hrs later , i call , find out it 's done .
worst car wash !
but no !
worst service , worst car wash and worst detail of my life !
no thanks .
bad wash as usual and no customer service .
convenient yes - but never going back !
too bad .
they also try and do everything so fast that its confusing for some .
so if you do go do n't pay full price !
filled up the tank and chatted with the attendant , nice guy .
when they flagged me down , i walked around the truck .
had to get them to finish washing the spots off .
do n't go to this joint .
lol they try and upsell you everything they can think of .
no sir i just want my car washed .
they left water spots , they did not vacuum my truck .
you would think it would be a little better in a area like this .
i would recommend everyone go to hot shots on 16th street .
the management there has some integrity requirements when they hire employees .
time to find a new place to get my car washed .
i will finish this when i get my car back !
after drying it off , another guy got in to park it .
they obviously have no respect for other people 's personal vehicles or opinions .
the vip carwash includes washing the car , correct ?
today was ( again ) a poor experience .
last time the car did not even looked like it had been washed .
this is the same sloppy work the last time i was there .
the passenger seat is wet .
especially for _num_ dollars .
i am extremely unhappy .
let 's see if anyone cares enough to email or call me back .
bell road has the worst customer service ever .
well even at the discount it was not worth it .
i later noticed that money i had in my car for parking was missing .
this place is horrible .
so , so horrible .
its been impossible to get in all week .
major suck .
i have been here _num_ times with three separate vehicles .
go somewhere where your car actually comes out clean though .
i feel if your paying _num_ for detail .
why so sloppy .
do n't waste your time here for a detail .
this place dont know the meaning of that word .
no thanks .
car was n't clean .
( do they really vacuum ?
let me add on to the pile of bad reviews .
_num_ bucks for a _num_ dollar air filter that is still mostly white ?
no thanks .
car was poorly cleaned and vacuum job was miserable .
i will never be going back .
_num_ of _num_ times , my car was not cleaned well .
on a previous trip , they stole my husbands phone charger .
this place is so slow .
i 'm not coming back here .
my $ _num_ car wash just became a $ _num_ car wash .
there is definitely a reason why this place gets such bad reviews .
there was an attitude of less than mediocre at this place .
i should have read the reviews before taking in because they totally suck !
shame on me for going back .
this is crazy that you have to inspect everything before you leave .
not helping your cause dude .
i finally get my car back , get inside and leave .
the vacuum job was shabby at best and my windows were still dirty .
they have really gone downhill over the last few years .
it cost me $ _num_ to get it fixed .
or maybe vacuuming out all of the stuff in the car is extra ?
i paid $ _num_ for a crappy car wash .
decent wash , sloppy dry .
will not be returning to this rip off spot again .
Negative
negative experience overall .
the place made me feel uncomfortable .
i was so wrong .
i 'm highly disappointed .
my car seemed worse off than it did when it went in .
next time i will go to los olivos .
stay away from these rip-off artist .
i have taken my car to several places to get the oil changed .
no hidden cost or shop fees the coupon said .
overall , if i could give even less stars they would get it .
no thanks .
no thanks .
no thanks !
if i did n't need to come here , i would n't .
plain and simple .
r u kidding me ?
lazy , unprofessional and downright rude .
it was like they actually used the stain water to clean the entire car .
why not focus on the interior and actually get it done right ?
utterly pathetic .
if you own an expensive car do not bring your car here .
unless you do n't care how your car looks afterwards .
why not put them in a dryer ?
again , this made no sense .
these items were not trash , they were barely used .
sorry danny , you have lost a loyal , formerly happy customer .
worst service ever !
even if the group on said free we will never ever go back .
i could n't believe it .
i told him no your guy told me this price .
too bad the management ca n't manage the staff .
i have n't been to this location in a couple of years .
its awful !
so sad that management let it go !
the card racks are all empty .
all the snack and candy bar boxes are empty , too .
but no one has bothered to remove the empty boxes .
not anymore .
even the fish tank looks awful .
my vip wash was not worth the money .
the entire visit was totally disappointing .
she shrugged it off .
so crappy .
no thanks !
he acted confused and did not remember seeing me earlier that day .
zero stars !
the worst customer service you could ever imagine !
all i know is i will never be back .
they know exactly what they are doing and have no shame .
terrible .
terrible .
terrible .
customer service was awful and my car was n't even clean .
never going back .
the worst car wash in town .
please do not give them your business .
without fail , it is an unpleasant experience .
all bad , management needs to take notice .
the employee asked me if i wanted additional services after i already said no .
very frustrating .
if i could give them a lower score i would .
horrible decline in quality of service .
this place is the worst .
the service has gotten worse .
i will not be going there ever again .
the wash was ok and did n't take too long .
somebody is not telling me the truth .
quick review : this place is terrible , do n't ever go here .
next day visit lasted another _num_ hours !
the car still was n't really that clean when taken off the property !
this is where i almost lost it .
so i pay , no problem there .
the guy even gives me a student discount after i noticed they honor them .
i hate this place today .
it 's very slow so almost no staff .
so my car has been setting for _num_ minutes now with nobody in line .
most expensive car wash ever .
my iphone was stolen out of my car on august _num_ , _num_ .
i filed a report with the police .
the last location before it was disabled was at danny 's car wash .
obviously , i will never be going back .
the manager did n't even seem surprised or apologetic .
like it was not anything new and he did n't want to be bothered .
if we could put _num_ stars we would .
how can anyone be so bad at running a car wash ?
this place is the worst .
i 've never left there feeling like my car was clean .
today i visited and it was the worst !
seriously , you ca n't clean before you open ?
the car wash was mediocre at best .
lying about it will only ruin your business as everyone cares about their time .
its not worth the money and time .
went to get my car washed today and had just left the bank .
not to mention my car still looked like shit .
they are rude , unprofessional , crooked , lazy and disrespectful .
Negative
if i could give negative stars i would .
this is the worst danny 's i have ever been to .
whoever runs this location should be ashamed of yourself .
the back of the car was n't even vacuumed out .
the worst , the store manager is unprofessional and not very bright .
by far the worse place ever .
never bring you 're car to this joke of a business .
they had a system error , and refused to honor my groupon .
i was advised to contact corporate .
a gentleman told me i was just upset because of the groupon .
another associate took me to the car to find our what was wrong .
not the most professional display , even for a car wash .
eventually i got my car , still not vacuumed thoroughly and left .
absolutely worst car wash !
will not return and should of checked yelp reviews before i went !
pissed i even tipped the guys who think this is acceptable .
people are very rude !
very poor service !
how bad could it be ?
they probably could have used three .
i had n't been in my car for more than _num_ seconds !
this used to be my go to place for oil changes .
it was n't the fastest cheapest deal and in my neighborhood .
never more than _num_ min wait .
but today they lost my business !
bad move !
i wo n't be back .
i still gave them a _num_ tip .
came in to get my newly painted car detailed .
told the guys it was newly painted to be careful .
i walked to a nearby shopping area and waited the two hours .
i also had to hose off the floor mats that were disgusting and crunchy .
no offer of compensation from danny 's .
i wo n't make that mistake again .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
you should hang around the waiting area and pretend you are a customer .
i 'm not .
do n't waste your money or your time at this place .
i used my last free car wash ( crappy ) today .
the wash was pretty decent and they got me in and out fairly quickly .
i do not believe anything about this place was honest .
i have been a regular danny 's car wash customer for _num_ years .
such a disappointing experience today !
it had n't even been put in line for the wash yet !
not easily replaced !
... bad ... to worse ... to the worst experience !
he attempted to find them but to no avail .
it is bad news by far the worst car service i have ever had .
and gave it another shot even worst .
the car did look a bit better but not $ _num_ worth .
i will not come here again .
it looked like i had just told him his dog died .
$ _num_ for a basic car wash ?
ave car wash at best .
_num_ degrees and the misters do n't work ?
anyway , just a piece of advice - do n't go there .
i have n't even seen my car yet .
i see a chip in your window do you want it fixed .
poor ethics on their part .
definitely one of the worst car washes i 've been to .
it was $ _num_ for a medium sized bowl and drink .
the chicken was mediocre and the rice was kinda gummy .
nasty .
perhaps _num_ years from now this will be a hipster hot spot .
* two pool tables .
* no beers on tap , but miller high life by the bottle .
* cash only .
save yourself time and aggravation and use another store , not worth it .
poor customer service .
and he 's particularly rude on the phone .
it 's too bad , since i actually like most of his staff .
do n't waste your time at this store .
my advice is to avoid this store .
was not greeted or assisted when i came in .
ups needs to do review on this store and shut them down .
the clerks who work here are very rude .
very poor customer service .
avoid this store at all cost .
unbelievably bad experience .
this place is the worst .
this is the problem with the ups store no two are alike .
sounded like it to me too originally .
i will not go back to this location .
stopped in to drop off an amazon return .
not here .
admittedly , like an idiot i just paid it .
as i started to leave , i felt taken advantage of .
i asked if i could have my packages and get my money back .
he again denied me my refund and packages .
he responded as loud as i was by asking me to leave .
i went back in to the store and asked for my boxes .
he refused to give them to me .
this is the exact opposite of customer service .
he is very unprofessional and the owner called me an idiot .
would give zero stars if i could .
i 've been to other ups stores and never had any problems .
this was my first visit to this specific location .
i did n't even want to give this location one star .
it deserves no stars !
it is no surprise this place has a _num_ star rating .
i am shocked at how rude the owner john is .
the owner ( john ) , completely unprofessional .
rude .
fed ex all the way from now on .
save yourself the headache and frustration , go anywhere else but here .
wish i could give it zero stars .
i called on a friday , and they were able to get me in .
( i ca n't stand that smell ) .
the top part ( roots ) were alot lighter than the bottom .
it 's just a really bad way to begin and end every salon visit .
also , if you buy a gift certificate , beware the expiration date .
it 's just not worth it to me .
avoid this service shop .
there are other repair stores in phoenix , use one of them .
i took it home and guess what , it made no difference whatsoever .
they told me it would be about another _num_ to fix it again .
i would stay far away from these guys .
they told me it would take a week for an estimate .
a week later i was told it would be another week .
a week later they said they would take three more days .
it turned out that a tech had died and they were short handed .
i would have understood if they had explained and not been totally rude .
their customer service is lacking .
they did n't look at me or acknowledged the fact that i walked in .
well ... the customer left and they continued to stay up front talking .
they never once acknowledged me .
it was the worst service i have had in a long time .
i could have taken the entire store and these _num_ would n't have known .
very very poor service .
i feel bad for whoever is paying them .
the sandwiches were ok , we ate them there .
your prices are very high and then to have tasteless cheese and cherry peppers ?
but how much gas are we going to spend traveling back to you ?
the raviolis tasted freezer burned and the sauce tastes as if from a jar .
as other reviewers have described , the customer service here is quite lacking .
they said they could not find it so it must not have come in .
i did n't feel comfortable to ask anymore questions .
worst service and pizza !
just ordered chicken bbq and i got something totally not chicken bbq .
i did n't even get to tell them .
my favorite pizza is pizza hut but not this location for sure .
find the other pizza joints in the area , i 'll not be back .
she came back and asked me if she could get my husband again .
these were tiny little shrimp drowned in sauce .
coworkers and i like to out out together after work .
ca n't comment on the food .
two stars for good beer selection , but lots of better choices nearby .
i had the wings , ( i 'm sure you are shocked ) .
a total cheers atmosphere for sure .
consider yourself warned .
typical late night bar food being served in a restaurant .
i used to love this place .
it all went down the past few weeks .
the food quality was lacking compared to their norm .
usually i could have shrugged this off but this last time was most disappointing .
the biggest complaint is their beer lines taste dirty .
usually i 'm not so easily offended but this was bit ridiculous .
the salad dressing ( blue ) was weak and the salad itself nothing special .
i was disappointed with the food and really disappointed with the service .
i wo n't be back .
his was sub par ; he ate about _num_ % of it .
everything was below average , except for the music , which was about average .
we did n't mention it and just asked for the the utensils and napkins .
my boyfriend said taco bell had better tacos than here .
there hummus was nothing special however the pita bread was very fluffy and delicous .
i wo n't be coming back .
they were so greasy he could n't pick them up .
we both had bad stomach ache for hours after eating there .
for two watered down drinks is a rip off !
mediocre , at best .
very disappointed in flavors in all but hamburger .
no recommendation on this place .
i would go back for drinks but not likely the food .
rude staff at bar .
the beer was flat .
eclectic mac and cheese was okay , but nothing special .
advertised happy hour beer specials but that did n't show up on our check .
also almost fell out of the booth because the bench seat was broken .
honestly the place was n't that bad for what it is .
the food was decent for bar food and the beers were really cheap .
i ordered one of their burgers that i could n't remember the name .
this place is n't good .
not a fan .
i want to like this place .
unfortunately my first experience has left an impression that is less than stellar .
my girlfriend and i had been wanting to try it out a few times .
this is a huge pet peeve for me .
finally we went with the sesame crusted fish with a melon salsa .
this dish started off a disaster and just got worse .
this is just plain stupid .
there is no need for a plate to be _num_ degrees .
unfortunately the fish was not edible , at all .
the melon salsa was horrid .
we walked in to a very dark bar .
the tuna was good but lacking some flavor .
i actually have been there twice in the last two weeks .
who never even apologized for the bad service and food .
to my surprise , some changes have been made .
instead , the house salad is offered at $ _num_ with the entree purchase .
it 's a shame really .
i ordered the lamb and it was basically just fat .
our waitress was rude , and our bill was _num_ !
it was horrible !
i think management just is n't paying attention .
we just wo n't be coming back .
this used to be one of my favorite places .
very disappointed .
worst experience ever !
the other couple was already sitting !
customer service is obviously lost on this place ( except the sweet door host .
worst experience i 've had in a long time .
but worst .
just `` i do n't know , so live with it '' .
umm , the bill was for $ _num_ , not $ _num_ !
not so much .
what a disappointment , all around .
i was expecting more since there are so many _num_ star reviews on yelp .
three friends and i tried rokerij for the first time on saturday .
i do n't want to work that hard .
ca n't you just spell out the words ?
what was delivered was an unappetizing mess .
really it was a terrible presentation .
also , our waiter sucked !
i wanted to like it so badly but no dice .
we would have loved it rushed .
huh , how did he get that wrong ?
he kept running away as we were trying to give him our dinner order .
his steak tasted like hamburger meat and my fries were cold .
i was falling asleep near the end as we tried to get the check .
maybe i hit it on a bad night ?
the dessert actually was very good , but too little too late .
okay food , terrible , slow and arrogant service .
recent outing included drinks downstairs and staff was unfriendly and uninterested in helping guests .
dinner upstairs was a poor experience .
has rokerij lost it 's touch ?
when i got there i was told it was n't available .
the hostess was n't rude but was n't about to accomodate .
very disappointing as expectations are always high when eating here .
worth the long wait to be seated .
i do n't want to look for another favorite restaurant .
i want to love this place so much .
but sadly i had a very disappointing experience there .
the atmosphere and wine did not disappoint .
when asked if i wanted it grilled or blackened , i chose grilled .
i get that not everyone 's tastes are the same .
i will only return for drinks and to soak up the atmosphere .
ordered _num_ small plates .
calamari was cold .
overall , below average .
what a disappointment .
however , we left bitter and disappointed .
that is borderline fine dinning pricing and should come out looking as such .
they then took the food off but left the other stuff on .
the bill came out to around _num_ dollars .
not impressed .
not worth the price or time .
it took like _num_ minutes literally to read the entire list .
anyway then we ordered some grilled oysters .
then my boyfriend tried one and it was full of sand !
such a shame .
if you choose to go with the mexican side of the menu its disgusting .
no one should come here and pay these prices .
too bad the manager has absolutely no clue what he is doing .
ok no big deal .
but after 20-30 min of waiting , i started to get pissed .
so we left and went to capital grille instead .
no employees for _num_ minutes !
we walked out !
still no water after _num_ minutes and no asking us anything !
very disappointing .
downstairs was too small .
too dark .
too warm with the fireplace going .
bar was packed and the chairs and couch i tried were n't comfortable .
no one wants a filet this way .
my duck was tough and fatty .
the wedge came out with no salad dressing .
the waitress insisted that it had dressing .
no offer for coffee and desert .
if i could give a zero i could .
waited _num_ minutes for a 7:30 reservation .
downhill from there .
our waiter was clueless and disappeared during our ordering and our meals .
the only good thing was the roasted beet side dish .
maybe this qualified for one star .
this used to be our favorite restaurant in the area .
the hype is killing them .
the kitchen and especially the employees need attitude and training lessons .
food on the other hand was not quality that we expected .
cocktails were not up to par either .
nothing here was as shiny as the build up to the place .
nothing to do with smoke house cooking !
she was excited that this would be something special .
it says complimentary , however it is just rude not to tip a valet .
there were plenty of empty tables so they did seat us right away .
i am so sorry that the expectation was so much more than the meal .
but nothing came out that was exceptional except the creme brulee .
keep in mind i did not eat here .
so this post is not about food quality .
just a shame .
the food is good but service is horrible .
i 've had nothing but bad servers with no concern for my experience .
there are too many good restaurants in this area to tolerate the rokerij .
back ... i 'd spend your money elsewhere .
and this absolutely ruined the evening for me .
very disappointing .
but the rest of the visit was less than pleasing .
the guy bartender did not smile once .
the chicken schnitzel was fine .
slow service .
we just wanted a little more privacy for his birthday but no biggie .
after waiting _num_ minutes after our appetizer was done , our entree came out .
this is disgusting .
we never even received an apology , smile , nothing .
to add , i emailed to let the owners know and received no reply .
horrible customer service .
the answering service promised an answer within _num_ hours .
_num_ hours later , no response .
according to their own manager , they would prefer that you go elsewhere .
no big deal right ?
i was visiting phoenix and we came here for my brother 's birthday .
what a mistake .
although the drinks and food were very good the service was awful .
at this point we still had not ordered out entrees .
i will definitely not be going back due to this experience .
sometimes i will give a restaurant a second chance but not this time .
the eggs benedict included a hard boiled egg and lacked any flavor .
the bloody mary was lame , no spice , no bite at all .
it tastes like french toast , if you like that then go for it .
service was horrible , the waitress forgot all about us multiple times .
all our glasses were empty most of the time .
service was horrible .
food was just ok , not worth the cost .
when we arrived there was complimentary valet which was awesome .
no worries , we were all about taking it slow and enjoying ourselves .
once our food finally came around i was pretty damn unhappy .
our server himself told us that our ticket time was _num_ minutes !
i dunno , i just left with a bad taste in my mouth .
that 's frustrating .
the kitchen and management really fell through on this tonight .
we will not be going back .
so sad to post this because we usually love this place !
officially not worth the the prices .
the downstairs bar and dining area with the fireplace has been a winter favorite .
sadly the downstairs bar staff were amazingly bad .
incorrect drink refills , arrogant and incredibly slow service .
i could pick it up and the red chile was paste !
no big deal right ?
just being a fresh order ?
not particularly fond of .
mask one 's odor .
as to the preparation of the actual meat .
lol so we said screw it and decided to check it out anyway .
he sucked !
the philly pizza was sub par .
it was low on cheese and some what under cooked .
our waiter was very generous , unfortunately i forgot her name .
overall , i would have preferred hitting up streets of new york !
by the way did i mention i do n't like police .
_num_ minutes .
this occurred on good friday between 1:30 and 2:30 pm .
it was then that he told me he 'd check on our food .
finally , _num_ minutes in , our food arrived .
my eggplant lasagna was certainly not the best i 've had .
i would like to say the poor service was because the restaurant was understaffed .
although the place was full , i counted seven employees , including a manager .
i have never been to a place with service this horrible .
there was only 1-2 dedicated servers , and they completely ignored us .
i just had to try something different than dominos .
my only complain in general would be the cost for my pie .
the sicilian here does n't really stand out .
meatballs were dry as shit and sliced .
overpriced , terrible service !
$ _num_ before tip is pretty steep for a med pizza .
italian sausage , black olives , onions , garlic and basil .
i first experienced nypd at another location , and fell completely in love .
something different was off with each experience .
i visited nypd this past saturday .
really disappointing .
this is probably the worst experience i have had .
i wo n't be eating here again and neither will my friends .
you seriously disappointed me .
my husband and i stopped in on saturday around 1pm .
we split the chopped salad and had a few slices of pizza .
water was never refilled and extra napkins never appeared .
the employees could care less if your there however .
only way we got a drink refill was to flag down the waitress .
they gave us a _num_ % discount .
however , i am pregnant and just miss this place !
the girl did n't seem to happy i was checking up on it .
it took _num_ hrs this time .
it was awful .
looks like streets of new york it is for now on .
disappointed in delivery .
terrible customer service .
i did or said nothing wrong .
so we went from _num_ stars to _num_ .
not for the food .
we ordered lunch , and food was forgotten .
crap happens , i understand that , so i immediately call .
( chicken on a salad ) .
so now my friend has some iceberg lettuce for lunch ?
this place has a very weird atmosphere , staff was awkward and weird .
not true new york pizza .
this is a chain of restaurants so that should say something .
horrible choice since it was so bad i really just do n't want one .
horrible choice since it was so bad i really just do n't want one .
i want my money back - you ruined pizza night !
the boneless wings we ordered were good at least .
wait , how did they even get seated ?
when i walked in they would n't seat me !
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
sat for _num_ mins without any type of service .
zero menu , zero water and zero waitress .
would not be coming here ever again .
the cashier was rushed and appeared bothered by our ordering and asking questions .
no additional veggies or croutons .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
very , very average pizza .
really disappointed !
it could have been the questionable food at the baja fresh we ate afterward .
minus a point for his lame joke about it costing $ _num_ .
the sales rep never said anything about a debit card .
can i only conveniently use it at a verizon store ?
he then called security , which is when i really got mad !
most inefficient place i 've been at .
everyone was pissed off in the store .
you ca n't get simple service without waiting .
i would rate this store _num_ stars if it were an option .
the woman i dealt with clearly had no desire to help me .
my friend and i walked in this store the other day .
the store had at least _num_ employees standing around and talking with each other .
i ended my service after _num_ years of being a loyal customer .
just where i finally realized verizon really does not appreciate its customers .
they then told me to leave , that they would not do the refund .
when i mention this they said they really could care less .
terrible service !
worst location i 've ever been .
i had brought the dog with me before .
horrible place !
so frustrating !
also their service was slow and they were n't very customer service focused .
this guy just wanted me to sign off on whatever and be done .
really really poor customer service .
had to reset whole phone to pull all my info in .
thank you verizon sales associate for wasting my time .
never never again .
worst store i have been to .
jen did n't offer any of those options .
these idiots do n't know one bit about what they are talking about .
probably one of the worse stores in north phoenix .
disgusted .
do not do business with this ppl .
the customer service at this location is extremely lacking .
halloween , xmas crap !
i 've heard they officially changed their name to big pile of crap .
i 'm sorry .
they did have some outdoor patio furniture , that seemed reasonably priced .
i think that 's why i was so disappointed by giuseppe 's .
failure , failure , failure .
it is very difficult to find real carbonara in the valley .
most places just toss together white sauce and bacon and call it a night .
not the greatest deal .
this place seems to want to get rich off being featured on food network .
the sandwich was a little better , but nothing special .
all in all , this was n't the best experience .
( its byob , $ _num_ corkage fee ) .
i 'm very disappointed in food network .
it was $ _num_ for two pasta dishes and bread .
$ _num_ for each meatball the size of a golf balls .
we could n't believe it .
on one hand , i 'm glad i did .
on the other hand , the overall experience i just found lacking .
reading many of the previous reviews , i had caught that it was byob .
no more byob .
oh well , wine never really goes to waste .
it 's gross .
not impressed .
bland , plain , flavorless pasta dishes .
husband had osso buca was very tender but again flavorless .
disappointed .
wo n't be a repeat client .
hardly inspiring .
did they end up in the calamari by mistake ?
a real disappointment overall .
the prices are actually a bit expensive for a strip mall and poor quality .
rude server obviously upset that we were not spending tons of money .
terrible bruschetta .
the only item i have had and really enjoyed was the meat ball sandwich .
this place was a huge disappointment .
the waiter also tried desperately to get us to purchase wine and sides .
for this stale bread , we got charged $ _num_ .
i will not be going back .
the noodles were a little dry .
$ _num_ for this is also way to much .
was this restaurant featured on a show from the food network ?
i should have stuck with take out only !
prices are too high .
each time i 've been to g. 's they have run out of something .
they say oh , this will be as good but it is n't .
whatever this place can suck it i wont be back .
the tomatoes were not ripe , and the other toppings were very disappointing .
we were so disgusted by our experience that we will never go back .
every time it has gotten worse .
the meatballs were small and tasteless , the sauce was very sweet .
in my opinion a stupid move .
maybe gordon ramsey should visit and give giuseppe a much needed reality check !
first off , i think the show got to the owner 's head !
the shop is extremely small with maybe seating for about _num_ .
the chairs were cheap plastic chairs .
maybe it was overcooked or bottom of the barrel for my dish ?
this place is not even average .
we have tried it 2x and just wont do it again .
not sure .
the prices were a little steep for lunch and being in a strip mall .
the sauce was a little dry tasting , which was a bummer .
overall the service was friendly and prompt , but not worth returning .
you 'd be better off with going to spinato 's pizzeria or oreganos .
i find these _num_ star reviews to be incredibly suspicious .
i 'd much rather take my money to a place that appreciates their customers .
i went there with several friends ( party of _num_ , including children ) .
i can not recommend this restaurant .
was so looking forward to it , sounded yummy .
she said no , and showed me a menu .
$ _num_ , for seven raviolis .
no soup .
no salad .
!
this place has nothing going !
it 's disgusting places like this are open and people rave about it .
it sure ai n't money baby any more or on point .
did n't come close to our expectations .
bruschetta was served on garlic bread .
my italian home cooking is much better and i 'm a novice .
he says , i asked you a question , do you have a reservation ?
so i answered , if i had one , i would 've said yes .
he says , can you not see how busy we are ?
i have never been spoken to so rudely to as a customer .
went here with _num_ other friends for dinner .
my osso buco was below average , flavorless , and dry .
r u kidding me ?
dinner for _num_ of us was way overpriced .
only thing good was desert .
the owner thinks he 's a _num_ star chef .
plastic water cups with these prices ?
dinner for _num_ here , will run you around $ _num_ or more .
restaurants pay thousands to shows like dd & d just to be featured .
the meatballs were okay and slightly above average size , but $ _num_ each ?
considering the prices , i expected more .
i do n't understand why anyone likes this place .
the food has no taste .
this was a return visit , so we knew about the limited seating .
i 'm sorry , too , for a very unpleasant experience .
avoid .
expensive wine list and our waiter pulled a wine scam on me .
the wine list here is ridiculously expensive .
i did not want to pay more .
then the waiter took the bottle away .
let me just say , none of us will be back .
Very negative
this is the first negative review i have ever given .
it was a disappointing dinner .
both dishes we ordered were tasteless -- adding cheese on top did not help .
the dish i ordered was a mushroom `` stew '' over ravioli dough .
not good .
i will not be back .
i would not go to this place again if someone else was paying .
when i got home it was terrible .
four small shrimp and hardly no alfredo sauce , i mean dry .
i did n't even touch that dry mess .
i was pissed off .
so we eat it with disappointment .
the sauce is tasteless i mean no flavor at all the bread was dry .
i do n't know why this place is crowded .
the food is bland and it 's so tiny .
guess i was expecting to much , it was okay not great !
the salad dressing was tasteless and the osso bucco was just okay .
i wish i had n't tried them ... it was a disappointment .
i looked over the menu before entering and _num_ employees offered assistance .
( fine dining ) there was parmesan but no salt or pepper .
the pasta was good , the sauce had zero flavor .
it was meaty but did not have a flavor at all .
i tried a bit of parmesan , nope .
i asked for salt and pepper , did n't help .
i will not be going back ... .
went there tonight .
only two stars , and that was only because of the service .
very , very disappointed .
i did n't eat mine .
did not come with salad , garlic bread .
very disappointing .
we have to adjust uncomfortable plastic chair and wipe fake candle on the able .
review is not for the food .
the calamari had no flavor at all .
but overall a waste of money .
the staff said only seating outside for right now .
it was hot on the patio no misters .
not rushing to go there again !
pricey , overpriced compared to other higher quality italian restaurants .
that 's not good , they wound up losing business .
so , basically , they lost my business and my referrals .
not impressed , will not go back .
man was i wrong !
it did n't taste that good .
it was horrible if i '' m to be honest .
not just better but _num_ dollars with bacon and jalapenos .
the size is a little more , too .
very tough and dry .
even baked ziti was just fair .
very inconsistent .
the eggplant parmigiana was heavy and not fresh .
a waste of $ _num_ .
i will not be returning .
it was disappointing .
Neutral
i have never been so disrespected in my life by the people here .
all in all , we would n't jump to return .
tonight we decided to go back and had high hopes .
the salad was fine but too much dressing .
with _num_ reviews and _num_ stars i had high hopes .
we were sorely disappointed .
the restaurant : dated decor , christmas lights everywhere ( in feb ) .
poor layout .
the food : mediocre would be a compliment .
the salad was lettuce carrots and oil .
the service : our server started off well but went downhill fast .
the price : there 's not much worse than over paying for lackluster food .
the verdict : any other italian restaurant is a better choice .
the decor was outdated along with the menu and food .
they did not break out with new flavors .
i will not be going back on my own free will .
very expensive , mediocre food , small portions .
l ordered the gnocchi with alfredo sauce .
i will not go there again .
two of the four we were treated pretty poorly by a female hostess .
food has been inconsistent , but not all that bad .
too bad .
we waited _num_ minutes before anyone greeted us at the door .
i said no , and he brought someone over .
the waiter did n't seem to thrilled to serve us .
not impressed with the service , staff , or food .
wo n't be going back .
how embarrassing for him ... would never go near this place against .
looks like he managed to have the review that detailed it removed .
how embarrassing for him ... would never go near this place against .
service was poor .
left before we could try food .
very disappointed .
i ordered the linguini with clams and my husband ordered spaghetti bolognese .
the pasta was more than al dente , but still good .
unfortunately my dish was not good .
linguini in that condition at home even on a week night in a rush !
perhaps from cooking too long , i 'm not sure .
and there was n't really any other option if the cooks were gone .
even my partner who likes vinaigrette could not eat it .
it was not worth the drive or the prices .
the food was nothing i expected from an italian upscale rest .
not worth it at all .
so why only _num_ stars ?
kind of sad to see .
anyway , i made my way to the movie theater , which is upstairs .
this bar does not have anything going for it .
weak .
no thanks .
i ate lunch here today , as it 's in my office complex .
this place sucks .
honestly , do n't waste your time .
the service is awful .
i hate the parking structure .
it 's just a mess .
a hot mess .
the tea was flavored and tasted really gross with lemonade .
then we split a medium pesto , tomato , and basil pizza .
costco pizza would have been better .
it was okay , nothing to write home about .
fries sucked .
do n't even bother .
this place is a ghost town with less than bright servers .
not one to waste liquor i finished it .
sorry i have not reviewed this joint sooner .
this burger was awful , maybe even freezer burnt .
barely to bites of meat all bread and not good bread either !
this is bad eggs and really bad bacon !
just not what they used to be and it just keeps getting worse .
also on a side bar the service has gone way down hill to .
they were barely warm !
$ _num_ house wines , and $ _num_ drafts .
i stood up , left money on the bar and walked out .
out of business , not surprising they have been going down hill for years .
it was disgusting .
gross .
this is for the filiberto 's at _num_ e. indian school .
i 've been through their drive-thru twice with a _num_ month period .
i 'm sure i 'm not the only one who has noticed the stench .
their beans tasted so watered down .
i got the huevos rancheros this morning and it was so nasty .
super disappointed .
bland , awful .
wo n't be going back .
was terrible quality and not even what i ordered .
not impressed .
no way , this place needs to close immediately !
Neutral
the service was good .
this place ca n't even get your order to you correct .
filibertos are individually owned and operated .
they were cold and soggy .
huge disappointment .
if they were n't ready , i would have waited for fresh ones .
i doubt i will ever be back .
do n't rent unit _num_ .
i paid two hundred dollars to have the place professionally cleaned .
your parking space is no where near the unit .
the clubhouse is no more , was converted into the new leasing office .
the hot water still takes forever to get hot .
oh the best part , rent goes up without fail every year .
not a very good place at all .
be very careful if you decide to live at this apartment complex .
worst place i have ever lived .
no water half the time .
no a/c the other time .
i ca n't wait to move .
the rooms are outdated and the gym / pool area are small .
i do n't know if you can self park the car anywhere close .
service = horrible .
i would say it was on par with a super _num_ .
i would not recommend staying at the ritz .
so , no fresh towels the following day .
however , to call this a `` center '' is laughable .
$ _num_ white rain on a marble counter top is n't classy .
it once again smelled of cheap .
was not impressed with a upscale hotel .
very tired and in need of a makeover .
rooms are not nice .
old ... just did n't feel like a ritz .
it had tasteful , old school decor and helpful people at every turn .
oh , yes and we were already running late so this was very annoying .
i said no , there was n't any in there .
when i went to my room , housekeeping was just outside the door .
but , then again i think there is a w nearby .
there 's something very wrong with this .
overall the hotel itself is a little outdated .
the downside is that the walls are paper thin .
just because your in the biltmore area , does not mean you have class .
it 's dead we ca n't kill it .
we were having breakfast and a server recognized my friend from past visits .
i was introduced by first name only to the server .
this is supposed to be highly inappropriate for their employees to do .
do yourself a favor folks and stay elsewhere .
like the biltmore hotel , royal palms , or the phoenician .
the pool does not include a hot tub .
the restaurants are boring .
i would only stay here again i i had business meetings close by .
this ritz is disgusting .
it could barely pass as a marriott .
easter brunch - i was so looking forward to this .
desserts were lackluster .
the whole time we got no service !
need to improve their restaurant reservation process .
around _num_ i started seeing dr. price .
i was told almost instantly that i needed a crown replacement .
there was no root canal needed .
however , i am not comfortable seeing this dentist anymore .
i have had a horrible experience here .
but this is n't the worst part yet ... .
i had been going to another dentist for my cleanings .
so , i walked back and they cleaned my teeth .
i did not want to continue going here after going through all of this .
i ordered bowl of clam chowder and the main lobster .
we arrived on a wednesday evening and there were _num_ of us .
we ordered apps , salads , wine and entrees .
the outer parts were overcooked and the inside was raw !
_num_ stars .
however , it took another _num_ mins .
, while the mac needed more cooking time .
even the replacement was n't any good .
my sister and i had a horrible shopping experience here .
i was so shocked and disappointed that i left without purchasing .
my sister and i had a horrible shopping experience here .
i was so shocked and disappointed that i left without purchasing .
they seriously need some customer service skills .
no , more like convenience for her .
um , excuse me ?
she insisted i drive myself ( which did n't make sense ) .
in other words , an order was n't even placed until i arrived .
even worst , it did n't arrive until 9pm .
do not use this company to transfer title .
stay away , stay far away from this company .
do not use these people .
they are incompetent and useless .
you will be so full of frustration when you are done .
the food was n't spectacular .
apparently , its not so good there .
menu selection disappointing .
nope , typical golf club restaurant .
what a disappointment .
only the valet was worthwhile .
do not waste your money on this place .
we waited _num_ minutes to get water to the table .
our client got a turkey sandwich .
nothing to rave about .
considering the options in the area , i wo n't be back .
it taste like pure mayonnaise on my salad .
first off the hall carpets are dirty .
the room was average but smelled musty .
i would not waste my time staying here .
for being as expensive as they are you would expect a better quality .
ok i 'm greek so i 'm very picky about so called greek food .
please tell me the owners are not really greek .
the pork and chicken were pretty disgusting .
both pork and chicken were dry .
the owner responded to this very quickly which is nice and shows he cares .
the fries are ok , but the seasoning is not very even .
that would put you out of business in chicago .
next the toppings are weak and need to be improved .
the pita is ok but not worthy of my mouth or money .
stop giving us greasy fries they suck buddy .
come steve better gyros for all is needed .
i mean dry and burnt just does n't work man .
but better gyros are down the street at z 's greek .
not impressed .
finally , my coworker politely asked if we could see the book .
she 's not here . ''
he then informed me he had no idea when she would be back in .
honestly , i really do n't care what his problem was .
not my issue .
i could n't care any less what he thought of me or my coworker .
blow it out .
this dry cleaners has got to be the worst one in the area .
it was truly insane behavior .
obviously , i 'm never going back .
unfortunately when i picked the shirt up the metal numbers were bent and scratched .
one week later after not hearing from her i called again .
when i went to pick up the shirt it was n't there .
so i left another note for sarah .
she then threatened me with her lawyer .
needless to say there is no resolution and will never use this service again .
the ladies restroom was worse than a truck stop restroom .
worse part about it was the managers rude reaction .
i guess that is why the place was dead at midnight on a friday .
it was also apparent that he lacked basic customer service skills .
never been here before .
girls ' night out .
not sure i will be back .
less drinks , same price !
the most amazingly bad service i 've ever received .
do n't let this place fool you .
btw def did n't taste like a merlot .
checked my credit card charges for _num_ separate receipts few days later .
she does n't deserve it !
adam said he would call back a couple days later .
one week went by and no one called me back .
spoke with another manager , francisco .
why would i go back to a place that is shady ?
anyway he said adam will call me back .
soon my two friends and i were yelling our conversation to each other ! '
i am not making this up .
fail .
we went back to bartender again because she kept our valet and garage tickets !
i did n't like that one bit .
i was n't blown away by the choices .
a bit disappointing .
also the ambience was nothing special .
not the elegant classic bar i was expecting .
the bartender was awesome .
just bad service lol .
not a fan .
the customer service was also very lack luster .
i was lied to about their return policy by an employee and screwed over !
the cuts were tough and just were n't prepared well .
the pasta 's were just boring .
recently , they 've been able to get a super discount on salt .
but this last time , i did send my main course back .
very poor planning .
does not leave a good impression as the last thing you remember .
if you have any other emergency , find another place to go .
i had my light on for _num_ minutes and no one ever came .
twice , they turned it off without coming in .
no one explained to me what was going on .
i wo n't come here ever for anything if i can avoid it .
terrible coffee .
what a waste .
my advice , walk across the street to starbucks .
located at the biltmore fashion park , parking is usually an issue .
the crew on hand is usually a little surly and sometimes a little scary .
and wipe down the counter .
sadly , no .
just know you 're lucky you did n't drink the `` coffee '' here !
i agree with jake ... mediocre at best ... .
finding a seating area off the main path is a plus !
the main path feels and looks like an over sized hallway ... beware !
although , i have so many friends who love this place .
i just do n't get it .
she said she could not do that .
no substitutions .
that cpk allowed substitutions ?
yep , i might tell other people .
this review is not for the food , it 's for the service .
i have not had a chance to review until now .
it was about _num_ months ago on a friday evening .
we walked in and there we some other parties seated waiting .
i went up to the hostess and gave her my name .
then another mom and child walked in and were seated .
she was rude and clearly did not pay attention to her job .
she was too busy trying to look pretty .
i wo n't be going back to this particular cpk .
cali ca n't do pizza !
nasty !
the food is fair but not worth the price imho !
i had one bite after my partner had one piece .
after the bite , i notified the server that there was cilantro .
first time in a cpk , was not thoroughly impressed with the food .
_num_ folks , so we got to try a couple of different items .
the food was n't horrible , just was n't worth the money spent .
why does this place still exist ?
it 's not the answer to any current question .
the pizza is never better than so-so .
in fact , i think applebee 's does salad better .
the service tends to be a bit slow .
there are tables jammed into every possible space .
terrible !
she was very direct and was n't pleasant at all .
i gave the soup back and she did n't apologize .
it was disappointing .
i 'm tired of coming here and having bad experiences like this .
this service is too inconsistent .
pizza tasted great but crust was like rubber , $ _num_ wasted .
does n't rate even one star .
why would n't you just turn people away at the door ?
glad it did n't make it in tucson .
super disgusting .
victor the manager argued with me instead of being apologetic .
when we were seated i noticed a very bad odor immediately .
i went to the hostess and asked to be seated away from location .
the next booth was n't quite as bad .
there again was that horrible spoiled dirty smell .
so needless to say i was very disappointed .
do n't think i could go there again .
i showed up about _num_ minutes before my appt .
a couple other employees walked by but seemed to act too busy to assist .
pedicure : this on the other hand was painfully long .
well as you can imagine that massage was lack luster as well .
there was nothing warm about it .
this pedicure is a basic one , nothing special .
she is incredibly rude .
for a $ _num_ ( overpriced ) pedicure i expected way more .
never will i go to this sleazy spa ever again .
i did not like the pedicure chairs at all .
they obviously do n't care much about their customers .
it was so long ago i was there i ca n't remember the service .
she apologized and explained to me how this could have happened .
when we finished she thanked me and apologized once again .
the manager never apologized or thanked me for my business .
this woman should not be managing a spa of this caliber .
there was no attention to my body 's needs .
i 'm really disappointed .
i would not recommend taking your pet to this hospital .
after seeing my dog it was clear i would have to put her down .
i will never step foot in that place again .
she acted like i was wasting her time by asking questions about valley fever .
i waited for a few more minutes and then walked out !
it was obvious that my dog needed to be put to sleep .
they only want your money they do not care about the animals .
arrived on a friday night around _num_ pm , the place was pretty empty .
the waiter was friendly but did n't have much personality .
we had the bleu cheese chips , which were excellent .
when it did arrive i was unfortunately , disappointed .
personally , a little under is always better than a little over .
and for a $ _num_ steak , it should have knocked my socks off .
however , the green beans we ordered as a side were very good .
i could tell throughout our meal the server seemed a little rushed .
unfortunately , it caused his service to really lack for us .
unfortunately , we probably wo n't be back .
_num_ minutes passed by and we were wondering what was going on .
safe to assume he forgot we sat down at one of his tables .
another _num_ for our food .
this did not wow me at all .
like the steak was gold on the inside .
we all know tips should be for quality of service , but whatever .
i am writing as the mother of the bride where we had _num_ guests .
at least two of the tables was missing a place setting .
no biggie , just get another place setting and we would be happy .
our entrees were salmon and new york steak .
the mashed potatoes were dried out and crusty .
i did not even get a water glass !
_num_ plus min .
later we met server at the bar for the bill .
never got drink or a sorry .
she probably thought we were poor people and could n't afford to eat there .
maybe she should n't judge people by the way they are dressed .
this place gets _num_ star because you ca n't give _num_ stars .
avoid , it is going down hill quickly .
looked at a _num_ bedroom apartment here a few weeks back .
an application fee that was something insane like $ _num_ .
this place is not safe to live in .
the staff is rude and unprofessional .
they will not help you at all .
the place is also dirty , the grounds are kept unclean .
avoid at all costs !
not worth the hassle to pay rent every month for lousy service .
this is typical of the place .
that 's not saying much is it .
horrible .
do n't go to this location .
they do n't follow the parent company 's lead .
you 'll have a headache by the time you get out of the store .
good customer service but the most disgusting smoothie i 've ever had .
a depressing waste of _num_ dollars .
she just sorry these do n't work and walked away .
just made us feel like idiots with her condescending attitude .
you 'll be disappointed with the lack of respect the employees give you .
for the price i paid i would have expected a higher quality of care .
the staff member i spoke with told me no problem and to come down .
she says she can not change out a _num_ dollar bill .
there was no one around to help .
the _num_ load machine is $ _num_ , _num_ load is $ _num_ .
the dryers are _num_ cents for _num_ minutes .
pretty lame right ?
pretty lame considering those guys make about $ _num_ per hour .
before i dropped a chunk of mass i ventured into this store .
yeah , this is before i started eating clean .
anyway , i had some questions .
same thing .
just left this place laughing my ass off !
no big deal right ?
he told me yea they do n't carry it .
he looked it up and still nothing .
nothing came up .
a full _num_ second stare .
you did n't even walk out till after 8:00 .
Positive
i do n't consider myself a negative nancy , hello bright side !
you did n't even walk out till after 8:00 .
Positive
i do n't consider myself a negative nancy , hello bright side !
did n't you just eat out ? ''
`` yeah , but we ate at miracle mile . ''
i got the chicken and noodles with a side of mashed potatoes .
foul , foul , foul .
the child menu is short and fare priced .
would have had a better sandwich and salad at subway for a lot less .
vegetable soup that was so flavorless as to be nearly nonexistent .
and then there 's your pathetic excuse for a sandwich , mile .
i 've given you plenty of chances , mile .
for $ _num_ bucks really , .
no thanks .
probably the worst tasting stuffed cabbage i 've ever had .
the ground meat on the inside on the other hand , was very bland .
no , i simply can not put in a good review for miracle mile .
who knows if i will get my _num_ for moldy pie back .
alas , that was not to be .
unfortunately the meat loaf was dreadful as were the mashed potatoes .
seriously awful .
it 's also not particularly cheap .
my prison plate was $ _num_ with the tax .
unfortunately , that did n't happen .
the food was less than average and nothing i would do again .
i do n't get it .
the food was cold including the soup , fries .
the brisket was dry and the service was awful .
the ruben was awful .
the mac 'n ' cheese was good , and the sandwich was just okay .
way better food , and for $ _num_ you can get dessert too .
ok , no problem .
within _num_ minutes , the corned beef arrived .
corned beef was dry and tasteless , cheeseburger ok for eight bucks .
do n't bother , especially if you want an order to go .
i do n't know how this place is even around .
it 's a sad weird place frozen in time .
avoid at all costs .
plain sandwiches and too high a price .
i do n't care for this place all that much .
the portions are big , that is correct .
the real cheesecake factory is in my kitchen , just so you know .
the fish was bland and overcooked , and the fries were pretty terrible .
sorry , penny .
wo n't go back .
right off the bat , our server was rude and disinterested .
this visit was most definitely my last visit to the cheesecake factory .
no comp , no apology until we cleaned up ourselves .
overall , food was good and service was sub par .
attitude was lousy !
better luck when seated at the bar , on past visits .
this time was no different .
_num_ % on the tab , which i understand with large groups .
as for the food , it 's a big whatever .
anything other than lunch is overpriced .
in the end it 's just overpriced ridiculously sized chain food .
i do n't understand why people love it so much .
not so much .
not a huge deal , being cheesecake factory on a saturday night .
at this point , it becomes pretty apparent we 've been lied to .
i have no problem with cheesecake factory not taking reservations .
very confusing , unappetizing and this dish should be chopped .
but last two times the service was terrible .
the cheesecake is the one item where you can not go wrong .
it was packed on a thursday night .
everything on the menu is sooo expensive .
the waitress could not recommend or guarantee anything that was gluten free .
it was n't very good at all .
this location is a hot mess .
choose another location the waitress smelled like a pack of cigarettes .
so standing over me taking my order made my stomach turn .
im asian i eat rice almost everyday .
i wo n't be back to this location .
we understand it is busy and there is going to be a wait .
we stayed though because we are not rude .
we always like to come out here to have our favorite appetizer and dessert .
$ _num_ per slice for a cheesecake ?
what i got from this location was nothing short of horrible .
next time i 'll just go down the road to chili 's .
i was n't offered water and warm bread came out _num_ mins later .
this location , however , is my least favorite .
needless to say , we left a $ _num_ tip .
also , we never got our boxes for our leftover cheesecake .
the front desk girl a few different times was n't friendly at all .
she kept making excuse after excuse not once did she apologize .
nope you 're wrong not with elizabeth .
we 've been back since and always make sure we do n't have elizabeth .
very disappointed and wo n't return to this location !
however , when it arrived i was very disappointed .
$ _num_ for a _num_ minute lunch !
the food is alright , just typical chain restaurant food .
i usually get the louisiana chicken pasta which always has a lot of flavor .
my beef with this chain is their portion sizes .
nothing special .
the service there is atrocious !
will not spend another dime at this establishment !
wait is longer than indicated - no reservations .
hosts do not acknowledge or update you .
what i did n't appreciate was what we got in exchange for his mistake .
i am embarrassed because this was my boyfriend 's birthday dinner .
our gratuity was n't so nice , because of it .
i went here last night with a party of _num_ .
they do not take reservations .
we got _num_ complimentary orders of nachos for waiting so long .
service was horrible .
there were _num_ servers for our group .
i will not be going back to this location again !
i can see why this restaurant has three start rating .
for this reason we will probably never return although we live _num_ minutes away .
the way they handle parties of _num_ or more is ridiculous .
this was nice as we do n't usually wait , just a habit .
the spinach , artichoke cheese dip was typical , nothing to rave about .
good spices and the chicken was tender but more pasta then chicken .
yuk !
no crunch , no color , no like .
the food was nothing to write home about either .
but unfortunately , we ended up not having much fun at all .
how rude , i thought .
why can ; t she just help me instead of trying to be sarcastic ?
that was simply not true , as there were other tables which had light .
there was no sense talking to them .
i drank water since i had lost my appetite .
we left disappointed .
one one occasion i ordered the chicken piccata .
wrong !
sorry cheesecake factory , you had your three strikes !
this place was no where near busy .
our food arrived with _num_ minutes to spare from our break .
it was very hard to eat .
the bathroom was very messy .
paper towels were everywhere .
my mom was very disappointed .
tired of my vanilla stylist , i went here .
i still hate it and i am still furious .
at least she did n't charge me for the haircut .
but no , i wo n't be going back there .
busy is one thing , cold is another .
she had no other work experience posted . )
if i wanted a brand new stylist , i would have asked for one .
it took _num_ hours and _num_ minutes to cut and color my hair .
i 'm _num_ yrs .
i ignored my gut and scheduled .
my answer was a very clear `` no '' .
and , the `` experience level '' really showed itself in the color dept .
it just was not good .
it was not a `` style '' .
she walked over to ask her and return and said it was okay .
umm ... no thanks !
fancy spa this place definitely is not !
probably wo n't be going back .
do n't answer the phone like everything is the same .
anyway , my haircut was terrible .
not cute .
my hair is a bit past below my breasts .
expected yes , impossible to correct , no .
silly me , i should of known better .
grand total $ _num_ .
i am too mad to even go back and have someone else fix it .
fyi .
like it 's my fault you 're only into young boys .
inside tables were left dirty , the bathroom was filthy too .
i am quite shocked that i did n't get sick after eating there .
both the health dept and corporate need to make a surprise visit .
this is my worst experience i 've ever had .
i would n't give them even _num_ star .
there is only one guy speaks english enough to understand what you want .
i think he hate his job , and he was in rush .
when i pointed out to him on this , he got mad at me .
and started do even worse .
finally , i decide get out of there before he kills my nails .
this place is gross .
i was greeted and promised `` _num_ more minutes . ''
i asked for the manager and there was no manager avail .
service was good but my account was overcharged .
i agreed to pay $ _num_ on my receipt and was charged $ _num_ .
if i could give zero stars i would !
in my mind i want to so are you blind !
ridiculous .
but instead it went back on the shelf .
i doubt this happens often but i wo n't be going back .
gel nails that chip after one day for $ _num_ ?
this is the worst manicure i 've ever gotten .
i want my money back .
do not go to this salon !
the gel manicure was peeling off the next day too .
do n't waste your money and go somewhere else .
terrible costumer service .
called and asked if they had availability to do _num_ pedicures together .
she said there would just be a _num_ minute wait .
i do n't have another _num_ minutes and make my friend wait for me .
i settled on a big chocolate chip cookie that was way too sweet .
like , inedible .
after a few minutes , the male owner talked me into trying the croissant .
i was disappointed in the quality of the pastries at this place .
and this bread was not it .
wrong !
the sweets may be good here but why was there no fresh bread ?
no french bakery feel at all .
this place is horrible .
pricey and bad service .
also , there pastry selection is always inconsistent .
they are ok , but not anything special .
i would not recommend this place and certainly will not go back .
so not worth it .
do not drive to this place .
do not go out of your way for this place .
we drove from southern scottsdale to arcadia and it was a waste of time .
also , waste of groupon money !
do n't bother .
the bad reviews below are all accurate .
the food was substandard , i could have eaten better at a cafeteria .
ridiculous .
it 's just not worth it , i would never return .
beware being ripped off at au petit four !
if only i can give no star , i would .
i am extremely disappointed , shame on you au petit four !
so we all walked to the dessert case .
no detailed bill ?
the kids were tired and we just wanted to leave .
i feel a little ripped off .
how _num_ faced can you get .
you know , we should have taken the kids to mcdonalds for dessert .
very disappointing .
i stopped in here for lunch one day last week .
au petit four a disappointment to say the least .
i doubt very much if they even sold those .
worst brunch i ever had !
i was hoping for a nice sunday brunch but was very disappointed .
pastries arrived quickly but no coffee .
halfway done my croissant i realized i had no napkin .
they were luke warm too , not as hot as from mcdonalds .
the worse thing is it destroyed our whole day being treated this way .
will not go there ever again !
my review has n't changed for the new place also .
the place itself has a very odd smell inside .
not my top _num_ smells to smell when you walk into the place .
no prices listed , so be sure to ask first .
the place has a stink of a sewer .
to top it off , the bill was $ _num_ bucks .
they were stale and nothing great and this was in the morning at 8am .
big disappointment !
sad cause i could have actually liked this place .
these people are horrible and rude .
the macaroon was so old and crunchy that i spit it out .
one bite of the tiramisu and i threw it out .
do n't waste your money at this place .
$ _num_ for two very gross pastries .
i dropped off my clothes thinking it would n't take more than 2-3 days .
at the time i did n't care and just wanted it done .
i asked for my clothes back and will never come back again .
_num_ stars .
but either way , i 'm gon na look around next time .
i am disappointed in this place .
they had n't done anything with it yet ( thank god ) .
however , they absolutely destroyed a pair of pants i brought in one time .
i had not even worn the pants or washed them .
overpriced and grocery carts are in the parking lot if you need one .
i prefer a sprouts , safeway , or frys .
for starters , i find thier food selection odd .
then , they stopped making it .
i dunno , but i have n't seen it in like _num_ weeks .
bought an apple pie and it went moldy in two days .
brie was expensive and the worst tasting i 've ever had .
love tj 's as we have been loyal customers since _num_ in socal .
not wanting to stand there all night i decided to jump in her line .
samantha proceeds to order me to use the chip in my new card .
the thing that rubbed me wrong the most was her comment before i left .
i personally will not be going back to this store .
what a really terrible experience .
he did n't apologize .
he did n't go check .
holy crap ... really ?
no friendly faces there anymore .
he never spoke another work or even acknowledged i spoke to him .
when it 's that time , there are _num_ houses i look to .
they just were not made with love .
i hate that i even need to give this place _num_ star !
never going back even if they paid me too !
she was quick and talkative but the quality of her work was awful !
within _num_ days they were coming up and cracking on the sides .
i paid $ _num_ for horrible set !
i am very unhappy and will never go back !
i experienced very slow service for ritz standards .
i had to wait a while for someone to wait on .
for the next _num_ days , i just walked across the street to starbucks .
restaurant was empty .
when the food came i realized why .
the meat was tough and the sauce was beyond bad .
why _num_ stars ?
so disappointing !
so disappointing !
do you valet more often than not ?
i 've heard great things about the food but i was disappointed .
dry aged steak ?
they just are n't supposed to be chewy .
the side dishes were mediocre .
again , steak is not supposed to be chewy .
i would say from start to finish i was thoroughly not impressed .
garbage .
went to capital grille for resturant week pre fix menu .
it also had very little flavor itself .
bad food and terrible service .
do n't do it , try city hall .
dessert was unimpressive as well and really uninspired .
they were a pain in the butt to deal with .
needles to say i will not be returning .
he then proceeded to wait on the other _num_ tables that arrived after us .
_num_ minutes later we flagged the busboy down to get us a check .
the food was delicious but the dining experience a large disappointment at every turn .
the caesar salad dressing tasted mostly of mayo .
i feel a steak restaurant should know how to cook a steak .
the mashed potatoes were lumpy .
the steaks themselves could 've used a bit of salt and pepper .
i would give this capital grille location no stars if possible .
we wasted almost $ _num_ on this horrendous dining experience .
mediocre at best .
creamed spinach mediocre .
they gave us an on the house coconut cream pie to go .
horrible food , my third visit and extremely over-priced .
honestly i would n't even take it home to my dog .
the steak that is almost tasteless .
veggies that are plain but buttery .
the only good thing about this place is the interior itself .
the dinner alone was _num_ dollars ( split amount _num_ people ) .
first of all the service was absolutely horrible .
even at that , we had to track him down to get the bill .
however , he did not ask us why or inquire about the food .
very bad service overall .
my husband 's was mediocre as he had described it .
mine was horrible .
the meal was so salty i could barely eat it .
really horrible .
horrible .
too many other great restaurants to visit to waste my time on capital grille .
the dining experience was terrible !
for a $ _num_ meal that was average at best .
we had dinner there tonight .
also they failed to fill water glasses and drinks in a timely manner .
this came out on a plate with gigantic grilled shrimp on top .
which is sad when it 's suppose to compliment the steak .
i think i 've had better steak at outback steakhouse .
the potatoes were bland and unimpressive .
to pay this price for dinner and still walk out hungry is sad .
save your money if you want mediocre steak - go to texas roadhouse .
would n't come back here again ... even for a free meal .
chalk it off to a bad experience but hope they fired the waiter .
for these prices expected a lot better experience .
and the steaks were overcooked as well !
no one could finish their steaks either .
then i went to leave and asked them to validate my parking .
tough , get used to it .
we will not be back !
this place has slipped significantly in the past _num_ months .
cheaper , better tasting and larger portions .
this place is the good , the bad , and the ugly .
unfortunately the chips are soggy after _num_ minute .
there 's your bad .
too bad .
ordered _num_ quesadilla and _num_ rolled tacos .
first off she tried to add extra beans .
politely told her at checkout no beans we did not ask for that .
turns out she gave me one less quesadilla then we asked for .
they are awful do n't go there .
what a huge disappointment .
dressing was over spiced , just burned .
pita was bland .
the food is better than the service which is n't saying much .
i probably wo n't go back .
disappointing .
food was n't terrible , but not good or great .
had the vegetarian appetizer ( $ _num_ ) .
i mean , that 's what greek is all about .
restaurants run out of things .
my chicken was low quality chicken , fatty , and kind of nasty .
probably $ _num_ worth of chicken .
salad was decent , but just a greek salad .
should have sent them back but did n't .
damage , $ _num_ bill plus tax and gratuity .
if you go here , get a cheap sandwich or a salad .
just do n't go here and expect a nice big meal .
myself , i doubt i 'll be back .
just too many amazing dining opportunities in phoenix .
it says you 're open until _num_ on sunday .
not cool .
no ambiance .
went there for pickup and the waitress was extremely rude !
worst service i 've ever experienced .
staff is incompetent and rude .
the prices were very affordable so i did n't expect anything heavenly .
i took a bite of the burger & it was very dry .
the raw portion of her chicken ruined it for her .
she ate her rice & salad , which were good .
shame .
we will not be back .
i was very sadly disappointed .
everything was bland .
greek salad tasted like nothing .
calamari fried in old oil as well .
gyro sandwich was bland too .
beer selection limited .
mediocre food .
the staff also has no idea what the hours are .
avoid .
not impressed .
very , very disappointing .
my wife and i are attending a conference at the arizona biltmore .
it was a disaster .
the pastries were tough and dry , and the fillings were not good .
the second wine was poured after we were chewing our undercooked pasta .
and the third came out _num_ minutes before its dessert pairing .
something had to be wrong , but that is not our problem .
stayed at the biltmore and went here because of an american express dining certificate .
Negative
if i could give `` negative stars , '' i would .
six months later , i am still disgusted .
i wo n't eat scallops .
six months later , i am still disgusted .
i wo n't eat scallops .
the lamb sirloin on black garlic risotto was tough and tasteless .
the halibut oscar did not have much flavor .
we do n't mind paying for a really nice meal .
this was not a really nice meal and was therefore way overpriced .
next to it was cooked spinach about the size of a thumb nail .
one of our friends actually sent hers back .
now i am not a big eater .
it was pretty pitiful .
but i would not return for the brunch .
we live on the property but we have never dined at the hotel .
ca n't say i would go back here again , maybe for brunch .
it is a shack of a place ( are n't they all ? )
but it had a drive-thru and thats all i cared about .
the chips were rubber and dripping with oil .
the taste of the oil was disgusting .
guess not .
this is where the bad experiences started .
i had two glasses of wine and my husband had two top shelf martinis .
the bacon wrapped prawns appetizer was ok , the dipping sauces were nothing special .
fine , no big deal .
$ _num_ tip on a $ _num_ meal !
strikes # _num_ , _num_ , and _num_ .
unacceptable .
anyway , staff , what staff ?
they were all too busy going through what they were going to buy .
( the really short _num_ 's looking guy ) .
that unfortunately includes the clothing side .
ive been to better consignment places .
however they are the only ones that would take some of my older clothes .
new location needs better ventilation .
awkward layout reeks of musty clothes .
and what i received in return in cash was $ _num_ .
it was because it was an item they had priced under $ _num_ .
they pay _num_ % and shipping .
i found my sisters closet was very dishonest .
that was completely false and i did not get a dime .
consignment shops are able to not have to be honest way too easily .
not all consignment shops are dishonest , but this one is .
their advertising is very misleading .
at my age , i think i know what a sweater is !
i am not returning ever again .
unacceptable !
bottom line : decent meal + bad service = _num_ stars !
not good .
and it 's not been for a couple of years .
only _num_ beers on tap .
garbage .
did n't see a thing wrong with it .
no apology .
i went to this salon for a _num_ minute full custom facial .
thought i would give them another chance .
no attempt to offer a discount or anything .
unfortunately the mani/pedi was possibly the worst i 've ever had !
not at all the case .
the biggest issue is that they have very limited appointments available after 4pm .
it 's a shame because this is a place i would love to frequent .
sorry , but not impressed .
when i finally did get in the experience was horrible .
do n't buy deals for this business .
i 'm getting a refund and going to dry bar instead .
whoever answers the phone here is pretty rude , as well .
this business closed in early november with no notice .
good luck .
hit or miss .
service can be slow .
this place screams style over substance .
i really do n't get why zen _num_ is always so crowded and busy .
could it be that people here do n't know good sushi ?
service and long waits are to be expected here .
back in the restaurant , the sushi is kind of lackluster .
the sashimi and rolls i 've had here were so-so .
i just have n't found this place to measure up .
maybe , if it was _num_ .
zen _num_ is terrible .
sushi was ok for phoenix standard .
there are other places that serve better sushi .
gross !
to make it worse , service was ridiculously lackluster .
zen _num_ was my sushi standout in phoenix , az until today .
after much aggravation , the manager removed the charge .
the floating flies were not the worst part .
conclusion , go to zen _num_ for the ambiance .
not the food or drinks .
then it got worse everytime i came there .
the rolls kept coming out soggy and cold and these were the tempura ones .
it was the opposite of fresh .
too bad , really .
the chefs could n't even see their hands .
if you fail rice , you fail sushi .
u wo n't b paying _num_ what the sushi is worth .
ugh .
also , the place is crowded .
not in a good , social lounge scene way .
seriously , it 's not that chic .
worse service ever !
i have been here twice and each time i have had the worst service !
server comes back and charges my friend $ _num_ and me $ _num_ .
then she told us that she could n't add the tip with it .
could n't she have told us that first ?
even the temperature of the food was n't right .
( it was n't very warm out there ! )
boy was that a mistake .
not only did it taste bland , it was also poorly rolled .
this place is lots of hype with no actual show .
they were extremely cheap though , something like _num_ dollars for _num_ pieces .
they 're seriously no bigger than quarters .
pathetic sushi , really .
they have a very limited beer selection as well .
totally disappointed .
i should have went to the safeway next door for sushi .
so sad .
my plate arrived and looked like a garden threw up on my plate .
the server was also very clueless .
= ) she did n't think it was too funny .
i walked away from zen _num_ and i wo n't be back .
there 's no other way to say it .
do n't get me wrong - its not bad , its just not good .
and , their happy hour is totally weak .
but , if you enjoy sushi do n't waste your time .
i am willing to pay reasonable prices for good sushi .
zen _num_ is n't one of them .
she did n't really have the answers to a whole lot of questions .
not good , not bad , just okay .
i would never return to this place .
food is mediocre at best .
please go else where for your sushi and japanese needs .
so cheap !
everything else sucks !
)
, for being the first to make me tired of sushi .
it 's that bad .
giving up does n't seem fit .
garbage seriously tastes better then anything at this location .
i have lost all faith in taco bell .
not really sure what went wrong .
lame .
again , lame .
blah , worst coffee ever .
had this place _num_ weeks ago and i will never come back .
horrible .
a waste of my time .
yep yelpers - i 'm not ever going back here again .
nope ... no big deal .
she said sure , no problem .
okay so then she sent me over to the bar to the hot coffee .
oh , but wait !
there just is n't any room .
and frankly , i never want to put that stuff in my mouth again .
i do n't see what this place has to offer .
several sales were lost today due to her total incompetence .
meanwhile , another customer walked in and stood behind me at the counter .
i backed away from the counter and got the hell out of there .
bad wifi .
ai n't no one got time for that .
i could not taste coffee .
no offer of anything else , no suggestions .
just the attitude get going and get of here .
tried out this place a few times and have never felt welcome .
go to sip down the street or lgo for the cold brew instead .
there are better buffets with greater selections around the same price .
read a review from the newspaper so i tried it .
not impressed .
gross !
not sure how , or why .
soup 's not the same .
plus , the chinese food choices in central phoenix are pretty sparse .
but i 'd get it to go rather than eat it there .
tried this place for lunch since i drive past it near my new place .
if that was n't bad enough the buffet food was terrible , too .
this was the most awful dining experience i have ever had .
low quality food .
first bite was disgusting .
could n't bring myself to finish lunch .
wrong !
the noodles , rice , everything was sadly made with no care .
now there are plenty of great chinese food around better than this nasty place .
Positive
now the negatives ... the cashew chicken was flavorless .
the restaurant was n't very clean and you could tell it needs work .
we had lunch today .
had their pork fried rice but the rice was overcooked .
beef and broccoli was salty .
the meats did not seem fresh .
the moo goo gai pan was very salty .
when i complained to the waitress , she ignored me .
the moo goo gai pan was so salty that it was barely edible .
when i got home , i was immediately sitting down in the bathroom .
so we had bloody marys instead .
)
the crawfish were decent size but the taste was awful !
they did n't even use the proper spices or anything .
for $ _num_ , that 's ridiculous .
i really do n't know why this place gets any positive reviews .
i went with five friends and nobody was all that impressed .
bland , boring and old !
get new recipes and better cooks .
bland , uninspired , boring and dark .
do n't miss spicy mary .
do n't miss it .
am missing something ?
is southern cooking just not interesting ?
i 'd hate to waste a star on this place !
how can a cajun restaurant get this wrong ?
the chicken was placed on bread that was hard .
wrong !
the fries were cold .
they need to season the crawfish with spices and not hot sauce .
our last visit was n't the greatest .
microwaved etouffee just is n't right .
that should be your clue .
regardless , i am only giving this _num_ stars .
do n't get me wrong , i 'm not complaining about the taste .
it was not good at all .
maybe it was an off day or something for this place.
stopped in for lunch today , it 's a saturday .
i 'm very hesitate to say but i must , it was n't good.
food seemed really dry like it might have been sitting awhile .
i felt really bad though looking at my husbands plate .
the food lacked flavor and just was sort of eh .
i went there for lunch with my boyfriend .
they were all edible but not very pleasing to the palate .
it was pretty disappointing .
nothing to rave about this place .
service was poor and the food was bad .
i know , i should n't expect much on cajun food in phoenix .
i had the red beans and rice which came out warm ... not hot .
the service was horrible .
not good .
my gumbo was cold and really bland .
it was really dry and flavorless .
overall , bad service and bland food .
it was not worth the time or money .
we were greatly disappointed .
it should have been more like a salad and less like a mayo spread .
last but not least , the gravy .
it was so burnt that we called the restaurant and returned it .
this year , with every bite , we became more and more disappointed .
this meal was not worth $ _num_ .
i can not recommend baby kay 's .
my review is already biased from the start .
i do n't mind eating food with seasoning and some pepper .
but i do n't like eating fire sauce in any of my food .
the jambalaya was way too hot for my taste buds .
had lunch with my _num_ year old on friday , april _num_ .
both were mediocre .
everything was mediocre .
pricey for mediocre food and service .
would not recommend this place .
the food was mediocre .
also , the rice was overcooked and mushy .
the seafood gumbo was just meh .
it was just a thin soup .
not the correct texture or flavor .
regarding the shrimp you really have to salt them heavily .
these shrimp lacked seasoning .
and this time the flavor was just totally lacking .
save your money - there 's no value to be had in this restaurant .
good family owned business , but call before you waste the time and gas .
inside tables were left dirty , the bathroom was filthy too .
i am quite shocked that i did n't get sick after eating there .
both the health dept and corporate need to make a surprise visit .
someone took me to the upscale biltmore shopping center one in phoenix .
ugh .
it was more like salt shrimp .
or soggy ass salt shrimp .
not good .
no awesome blossom here folks .
not much joy in this club .
just awful .
first the phone call to the office was less than desired .
i was n't given a choice .
why not offer to fix it ?
the price should have been about _num_ in my opinion .
no questions , no apologies , no explanation .
the person at the counter , was pathetic when it came to providing service .
when i put it in the pool it still had the same problem .
can i give these company a worse score ?
less than _num_ years later , the pump i purchased is broken .
i am not the only person this happened to .
no apologies .
no warranty .
i said `` why are there bubbles coming out of the return .
mike just basically blew me off .
had their tech guy out and he was just plain rude .
yes , i told you it was a _num_ '' cover i needed .
no point in giving my money to people who definitely do n't appreciate it .
worst haircut i have ever had !
that is how bad she left it .
this is the worst haircut ever !
but i was wrong .
so i am stuck .
which is why i am warning others .
he was not that great but friendly and nice guy .
i refuse to go back .
i really do not see why .
through living social and yelp , i found 25th street automotive .
i wish i had gone elsewhere .
this was not the case .
it just made no sense at all .
i have never been denied service on purpose .
i have never been treated so rude .
do not give this store your business .
)
this candle cost almost $ _num_ and would not light !
i would never hire this company again .
there is a real lack of ethics and professionalism at the company .
is it possible to give `` zero '' stars ?
i 've been in there twice and the employees were rude , both times .
i 'm a paying customer too .
the little boy who said he was the manager was rude too .
staff is mostly disinterested , but some are helpful .
i mean i know working sucks , but come on it 's your job .
do not go to the ski pro outlet - terrible service .
charity `` the cashier '' was extremely rude to me today .
the business does not even have the courtesy to call their customer back .
i will certainly not bring my business to this place again .
and i will advise everyone to avoid this place .
i will also be sharing my experience online on social media etc .
the manager still has not called me back .
the boots were sold as new , on clearance .
big mistake .
i give the bartender who works at this hotel _num_ stars .
we stayed here for four miserable nights & two awful rooms .
the first room had a broken a/c so we tossed & turned all night .
what 's wrong with this place , then ?
second , the staff could not care less about pretty much anything .
bottom line really bad bad customer service .
stayed _num_ nights for spring training .
staff are super friendly , free breakfast and evening cocktails and snacks were nice .
carpets in rooms and common area are dirty as well .
gym is small and outdated .
these rooms are not what i expect for this price .
over all very disappointed in this property i would not recommend it .
extremely dissappointed i must say !
breakfast was not worth the time or money ( free ) .
i checked out the next morning and wo n't be back .
this hotel is very disappointing .
checking in was a breeze .
then i found out it 's only free if you 're a member .
an old hotel stench .
bathroom was very slow .
other than that , i 've experienced better .
miserable customer service from a battered , tired , dirty & old facility .
such an outdated hotel i 'm totally disappointed .
this hotel was built in the 80s and clearly has not been updated since .
i could even hear the embassy suites shuttle and its reverse warning .
every entrance to every room faces the interior courtyard .
its just a bizarre set up for a hotel .
the bathroom makes no sense .
i just expected more from one of the higher end hilton brands .
a/c does not work if you want it cooler , stay elsewhere .
also rooms have a terrible old musty smell .
rooms were not cleaned properly , do n't even think maids have a vacuum .
carpet in lobby and hallways filthy !
seven day stay between christmas and new year .
dirty beyond belief .
seven days here and i did not see one vacuum being used .
pool was filthy and lots of missing tile , cracks and leaves in water .
birds in the atrium while food was being served .
a dog was led through the atrium during breakfast .
but dirty silverware was the final straw for me .
_num_ ) no ac .
_num_ ) absolutely and completely filthy .
2nd room smelled like _num_ years of smoking have been going on .
_num_ ) elevators are unbelievably slow .
limited electrical outlets .
overall : not so good .
and when i have arrived there was no room for me .
was sent _num_ miles away .
replacement hotel was not good either .
do not trust this property .
visited this hotel for a conference and opted for the upgraded room .
the hotel itself is filthy .
the most disgusting thing is the food in the hallways .
next year we will be staying elsewhere if the conference is held here again .
i do n't even know where to start with this horrible place !
its _num_ degrees outside !
still , i expect excellent service from hilton and this location falls far short .
boy was this the worst mistake i ever made .
until it does i would not recommend this place to any frequent hilton user .
the dessert selection was also less and portions appeared to be cut smaller .
it was shocking and frankly , insulting .
it 's really a shame .
it was bad .
i have had some mediocre carpaccio before , but never this poorly prepared .
i suspect a bad cut of beef .
the fries themselves were overcooked and tasted like jack in the box fries .
when it arrived , it was clearly not medium .
our glasses were never empty and the food did arrive promptly .
more like a ton of disappointment .
$ _num_ bought us entry into the mansion and nothing else .
that was n't mentioned anywhere .
drinks were small , weak and overpriced .
( $ _num_ ) not very decorated at all for halloween .
they were serving food ... appetizers were $ _num_ a piece .
total waste of time and money .
i had the cesar salad which was fishy with stale croutons .
the carpaccio was the worst i have ever tasted .
and worse , it tasted like it .
i am pissed !
there is no longer a $ _num_ buffet .
i swear , even the outdoor lighting has been removed !
but they were not prepared .
the service was very poor .
it 's likely i wo n't be back .
and the salmon was too salty even for me .
recommend ?
the food was horrible !
the server was the worst i have ever seen .
hmmm well what about the two tables that walked in _num_ minutes after us .
the table next to us was also pissed and yelling at the server .
it was unbelievably bad .
most restaurants would have a baked potato or something to substitute .
that 's absurd .
the food was below average relative to the prices .
also , the service was very sub-par on most accounts .
we were disappointed and embarrassed by several things .
once we were seated it went downhill .
the manager shrugged and walked away .
one can be in error on this too .
we were so disappointed !
clearly there was available tables we could have otherwise dined at .
this was the most disappointing dinner we have ever had .
the food was terrible , the prices were high , the service was indifferent .
the $ _num_ glass of wine was the only thing that was good .
it is very sad when a restaurant ca n't cook a steak .
then the service was disappointing as we hardly saw our waitress .
we were visiting from out of town and this was our first visit .
very , very poor .
first course consisted of shrimp cake or butternut risotto .
the soup was ok but nothing to write home about .
the fish over couscous was cooked well .
the espresso creme brulee was more creme than brulee .
even with the voucher , the tab came out to about _num_ .
the server probably could have been a bit more professional .
i consider this deal a rip off .
we went there to celebrate our anniversary and were really disappointed .
saturday evening , for dinner , was an experience that left us very disappointed .
i am unsure why .
the restaurant was not full .
the views , outside , were fantastic .
we saved our money on the card since there will be no second visit .
had a deal , it was not worth it , it was a ripoff .
a top , and , it is high .
handicapped , it is really dangerous .
they have taken away several of the better offerings .
sure the mansion is nice ... but brunch lacks ... alot .
no real substance to anything food wise .
real disappointment .
it was a very limited menu and small portions .
the food was average at best , not super flavorful .
the atmosphere was nice but i 'm pretty sure we are not going back .
very marginal food .
but the food was poor at best .
we will not be going back !
he also said the carpaccio was n't very good .
the starters were passable but nothing either of us would want again .
the highlight was a small chunk of gorgonzola cheese .
i ate here this morning for brunch with my husband .
the meal cost $ _num_ per person .
i wish i could say the food was out if this world .
the omelettes were made to order and so were the pancakes which were good .
however , the rest of the food not so good .
the croissant was dry and the prime rib was chewy .
i so wish i could give this restaurant a glowing review .
visited for az restaurant week .
our server was curt and mostly ignored us .
waited far too long for the check .
servers , bartenders , and managers displayed unprofessional behavior throughout .
chicken and steak we ordered were dry , salad was nothing special .
flourless chocolate cake was dry .
plus $ _num_ fee for valet ?
far nicer restaurants in phoenix offer valet for free .
this place is not worth the time or money .
wo n't be returning or referring .
bar options were ample , wine was decent , and service was adequate .
the food however was a desperate cry for help .
if i had the chance to go back , i would n't .
service was horrific .
the female bartender in the main bar was rude and never did serve us .
however , do n't go for happy hour .
hardly any room , and the wait staff really is not into that .
the hr food was horrendous and all fried carbs .
it just got worse from there .
skip this place and spend your money elsewhere .
start looking around and the service and food is quite unremarkable .
oh , we waited 15-20 minutes for our cocktails , too .
sometimes she would even poop and pee herself obviously completely terrified .
be weary of this groomer .
now i had a very bad experience with this groomer .
i 'd wondered why my pup was acting so odd and scared .
very bad experience trying to board my dog .
i have a _num_ yr old puppy who goes to daycare regularly .
he also said they did n't have any capacity to board her this weekend .
what a huge waste of time and frustration !
lame .
a real horrible experience , never again will i go there .
worst experience ever .
slow as hell and no customer service .
it 's the worst day food we have had since we moved here .
just threw it all in the trash .
a waste _num_ $ .
_num_ minutes pass and the cars are lining up behind me .
she could not get the order straight .
she finally just quit talking so i drove to the pickup window .
some people just ca n't decide what they want '' .
by now there was only _num_ car behind me as everyone else had left .
not a good first impression .
this was n't some `` maybe '' food poisoning .
also , just like other reviews stated - the service here is the worst .
this location needs to get it 's sh*t together .
only reason i went so many times is because it was nearby .
just go to a different location .
very unprofessional and rude .
he came & fixed my problem quickly .
no fix , no refund , no nothing .
Very negative
this is the first negative review i have ever written .
ca n't see myself ever coming back .
they took my money and then i sat for over _num_ minutes !
i could 've made my own chicken dinner at that point .
avoid this location .
what a waste of a trip .
we waited _num_ minutes at the speaker before they would take our order .
they took _num_ minutes at the window .
said they could n't give us a receipt .
our food was cold .
i drove twenty minutes on a friday to get my family dinner .
i arrived at _num_ pm and they are supposed to close at _num_ .
such a terrible experience .
we all proceed to go back and the man says he can fix it .
total rip off .
avoid .
a terrible experience .
i do n't understand why they are still in business .
well , it just goes to show that yelp does n't always work .
i gave my dog ( really ?
i told him she already had blood tests , etc .
no , they must have them done again .
could n't be bothered with holding her or catching her .
wan na bet that 's the first thing they look at ?
it is filled with lies , as it would be .
i have proof from three other vets that his diagnosis was wrong .
no blood .
he just kept yelling how she 's obviously in heart failure .
i have no reason not to .
no thanks .
i did not receive a call back at all .
shop elsewhere to avoid the wait .
the friendly operator said someone will get back with me shortly .
will not be visiting this clinic again .
i truly hate this vet office .
f & @ $ this place and every body that works there sad .
bad all around .
worst apartment complex in the history of the world .
and they refuse to fix it !
management is horrible .
staff is completely useless .
run run run away .
i really think the `` phoenix film festival '' should be in phoenix .
what the hell is this place ?
no , `` they do n't do very well here '' .
my recommendation , do n't bother .
the beer was flat , however the bartender switched it so that was decent .
however , i had really a really poor experience .
then i arrived ... no one came over for like _num_ minutes .
i flagged down another server and told her we needed our server .
not a very professional response .
i just think that 's really skimpy for a $ _num_ dollar meal .
i was just really disappointed tonight and thought you needed to know !
she was still friendly and attentive , but overall not the greatest experience .
slow service and they were empty .
we spent our _num_ at a different restaurant .
however , we just had one issue after another during our visit .
the taste was n't bad , but it was just impossible to eat .
there was very little fruit , and the dessert was greatly lacking .
the food is just ok nothing special .
the service is just ok too .
worst wait staff and management i have ever experienced in my life !
i would n't go here expecting too much .
the food was really bad .
will not go back .
very empty at dinner time on a thursday .
odd crowd and wait staff seemed uninterested in our table .
no soup for you !
it should be simple enough , `` no more stars for you '' !
after that , i just did not have the heart to come back .
the last time i went , we waited _num_ minutes before just giving up .
horrible !
that is a direct quote .
avoid this place !
the gm is n't friendly and could careless .
you can tell the staff is n't well trained .
big disappointment .
we stood up and our server was nowhere to be seen .
not sure if we would try this place again .
but the rating goes mainly for the staff .
should i not have been advised on later appointments what the results are ?
everyone has been back to see the doctor but i am still here .
this is n't the first time i have had to wait .
as i sit here _num_ more people have walked in .
urgent care would be a better option if you need to see the dr .
worst mexican food chain ever !
is it so expensive to have more than one bowl of chips ?
fail .
well , the steak fajita nachos were ok too .
but only if i can have a margarita next time .
i 've been here twice now and each time it reeked of rotten eggs .
frustrating .
not impressed .
for instance , there were about _num_ plates ... more than we needed .
veggies were fresh , some of the quantities pretty skimpy .
it was really empty when we were there .
but recent experience not so great .
seeing my disappointment , the sales woman offered to get it from another store .
there really was no other option . ''
then , i noticed a $ _num_ `` ground '' charge .
`` yes , unless you use your saks card , you pay shipping . ''
not your best , saks .
he treated me as though i was an inconvenience to him .
horrible quality and costumer service .
this is just an unreal experience so i have to share .
this is where it goes weird .
she says they have them , but not for sale .
she next says , would you like to see one ?
i say sure , i would like to hold it and not buy it .
obviously missed my joke .
she is still confused ... .
so i leave and go to the fashion square gucci store and buy one .
this whole _num_ minutes was so surreal , simply blows my mind .
worst possible customer service experience at lv .
terrible sales associates .
do not waste your time .
recently i decided i need to splurge on myself and get a chanel bag .
it took me _num_ seconds to get someone to look at me .
_num_ customer and _num_ associates and they were all trying to pass on me .
out loud .
disappointed in their shoe return policy .
i will not shop for shoes there again .
snooty vibe , unwelcoming pretentious people .
i 've shopped on and off at that store for years .
too many other stores that i can spend my money at .
the wrap work was done appropriately , but the customer service is pretty bad .
why do they schedule appointments if they ca n't honor them ?
i would recommend shopping around for better customer service .
pretty poor customer service in my opinion .
turns out i was wrong .
i waited another _num_ minutes in there before his pa arrived .
_num_ days later and i feel exactly the same .
are you kidding me ?
i told them it wasnt a problem but i was just having some symptoms .
his staff is extremely poorly managed .
steak is probably better in the desert .
played the links course for the first time and will not be back .
while facilities are nice the course itself is lack luster .
the bad part !
played my _num_ holes and got out !
they cant tell me anything til monday !
she also saw bubbles in the platinum along with the crooked channel setting .
i do n't understand all the good reviews .
we shared the caprese appetizer .
for lunch i had the pasta trio .
disgusting .
we drank waters and the bill was $ _num_ after tip .
i wo n't be going back .
we felt the whole thing was a rip-off and will not be returning .
)
and pass on dessert and salad course unless you like a ton of dressing .
the experience did not improve my initial opinion .
wo n't be trying this restaurant again .
while the ambience is pleasant , lighting is too bright for a romantic evening .
Negative
negatives were the entrees .
groupon rip-off .
i had n't eaten here in years .
nothing has changed it 's dark and outdated .
the veal parm which is my favorite of all time was not good .
the veal was rubbery and the breading soggy .
the pasta was way overcooked although the sauce was good .
the tiramisu was soggy as well .
the cake at the bottom was soaking wet .
the risotto was undercooked and had no flavor .
this risotto was a disaster !
my friends vegetables were mush .
it was worse than the first visit .
the long and the short of it i wont be back .
disgusting !
had a groupon so my daughter and i tried it out .
the food itself was pretty bad .
we were given _num_ dinner menus for _num_ people .
the entrees where very bland and lacked flavor and substance .
very disappointed .
maybe it was because i went on an off night ( tuesday night ) .
and do n't get me started on the decor .
and if you want a cleaner taste , try 5th & wine .
everything was extremely overpriced for the quality and the service was terrible !
beware of ordering the bruschetta if you do not like olives .
he got a tip , but small because the service was so bad .
will not go back again .
there were _num_ or _num_ other tables here that night ; not very busy .
she did not seem to enjoy this very much .
even worse the butter soaked farm raised salmon cubes were just luke warm .
the vegetables were mush and again just luke warm .
however the food was horrible .
my girlfriend and i went there tonight and the food was way over priced .
i feel like i paid $ _num_ for professionally prepared tv dinners .
i am in shock this place has been open since _num_ .
nasty !
completely outdated overpriced food .
coming here was not my idea .
not here .
this was all for the price of around $ _num_ per person .
did i mention the over-priced , watered down drinks ?
no real italian would ever put cheddar cheese on an antipasto .
i was very uncomfortable having to pick with my hands .
it was all poor quality food and poorly prepared .
for starters we ordered the pasta trio sampler and the oyster rockefeller .
it tasted at least _num_ days old .
i look forward to cracking my crme brulee , darn !
needless to say i will never be back here again .
the shrimp cocktail was large , cold and fresh .
the steak that my brother in law had was very large and cooked properly .
i had the pasta trio .
there were _num_ of us dining .
wo n't do it again .
, mushy , and tasted several days old .
_num_ seating .
order taken , maybe slightly rushed .
we were not advised of the specials for the evening .
even though , the most expensive item on the menu .
then service fell apart .
we ordered tiramisu , absolutely disgusting .
i 'm so glad i ordered sausage and peppers from another vendor .
mushy and in a gooey tasteless white sauce .
the ambiance of this place is nothing amazing with its outdated decor going on .
no where on google does it say that its supposed to be that soggy .
i should not have to repeat myself to have to ask for things consistently .
the flavors were very blah .
just a bunch of mush .
i will never dine here again .
_num_ bucks a plate .
more like an american italian food .
the best part is the tacky 80s decor !
it 's not authentic italian .
the pasta was not served al dente .
it is terribly ugly !
so do n't go here expecting a good view .
the whole thing was bad .
my date got spaghetti which was n't anything special .
it did n't have enough sauce on it and it just was whatever .
this place is a little over priced for what you get .
horrible food .
super disappointed .
i 'd never go back .
a week later , i started hearing the noise again .
ive been having my car serviced here for _num_ years .
they are careless and do not take ownership of their mistakes .
zero customer service !
Negative
if i could give a negative star i would .
shoddy work , inept & rude .
so , clearly customer service is not a priority for them .
Negative
as in other reviews for this location i wish i could give negative stars .
_num_ years plus of routine service , oil changes etc .
i will stick to the dealership and discount where they appreciate your business .
but overall this is just like any other food city .
otherwise it would have been _num_ .
also missing was a jalapeo pepper .
no worries , just a mile down the street .
geez ... ... that 's just really bad customer service .
we were ignored for most of our short visit .
we were n't really greeted .
there was no , '' hello , how are you ?
there was literally no one else in the store .
she said she did n't have either .
i was really disappointed .
nothing too fancy , but certainly well-maintained and clean .
the cashier was a nice enough kid , this really was n't his fault .
not $ _num_ for the first session .
it would be great if they were new , but they 're not .
we 're not complete snobs , so we did ok .
i literally hated this place .
this place is dated .
i 'd much rather go to the alley on scottsdale and thomas .
unfortunately , like i said , they suck at servicing the customer .
also , the lanes and the area around are really poor .
its not the worst alley in town , although close to it .
not impressed .
i roll in and it 's not done !
so i dropped off tow shirts a few days ago for dry cleaning .
those guys should be in the money laundry business imho .
a while back i dropped off two dresses to be dry cleaned .
_num_ of the employees saw me , ignored and one proceeded to clock out .
now i 'm left with _num_ of _num_ shirts for a work event .
i wish i had looked at yelp prior .
wo n't make that mistake again .
this is sick and made me lose my appetite .
worse service i have ever had in the _num_ years of visiting this place .
this place lost a good waitress when laura left .
sorry jerry 's restaurant but your food is terrible .
i will not be returning .
was the cook .
this was an awful experience !
the food was good but the service is the worst !
let 's just say do n't waste your time .
almost nothing served at this restaurant is made in house .
the only thing made in house the night we visited was the meatloaf .
it was mediocre .
not terribly impressed .
for $ _num_ after tip i will probably never be back .
well , needless to say my food was incorrect again .
we sat for _num_ minutes before the server came to take our order .
she did n't say hi , did n't say there would be a delay .
the only cook was n't talking to her .
lame !
thankfully the meal was pretty cheap .
i ordered the hot turkey sandwich .
it was tolerable .
however , the service sucked !
the service is appalling .
not even a hello , or sorry to keep you waiting .
_num_ minutes passed .
_num_ minutes ago .
no one cared .
hire more servers !
maybe then people will want to come back .
gross .
gross .
gross .
service is awful and the food was just as bad .
there were just two servers on for the place .
service was slow to say the least .
the potatoes and toast were pretty standard issue stuff .
nothing out of the ordinary and nothing wrong with them .
the pancakes were good , but the potatoes did n't have any flavor .
i felt uncomfortable being in their restaurant and eating their food .
this was pretty much the worst dining experience ever .
the waitress was highly defensive when grandma made a comment about order being lost .
in the last three months the service has been absolutely horrible !
unfortunately she only works certain days .
service is bad !
bad !
bad !
id like to add that our waitress was not pleasant .
when it came time to pay the bill , i gave her cash .
that is a big no no for me .
we just left the restaurant .
the manager was n't in , i will be speaking to her today .
there are good greasy spoon restaurants and bad ones .
.
it was tasteless and cold .
poor service , cold coffee and food , wrong everything .
third time coming in , it was ok , could have been way better .
chicken fried steak was frozen great .
there was nothing wrong with service , the food was terrible .
it sat like a lump in my stomach , leaving no room for desert .
the herbs did nothing for the dish .
after going , i think perhaps we should find a new place .
even the oysters on the half shell were just there , nothing special .
all in all , not enough positives to go back .
it was just ok.
the bartender , brian , was very attentive .
just ok for lots of money .
overpriced and not the best phoenix has to offer .
mediocre food .
mediocre service .
unfortunately , i did not have a good experience .
i ordered a grilled cheese with tomato and split pea soup .
the waitresses were very friendly , and the prices were not bad .
wo n't be back .
in the mood for comfort food ... i was disappointed .
i wo n't be going back there ever again .
i just ate there about _num_ minutes ago and am still feeling pissed off .
everywhere i looked , things were grimy and just not ... clean .
when the food came out i was already over it .
$ _num_ dollars !
for me and my husband to have pancakes , eggs , bacon and coffee .
that did not include toast or potatoes and half the plate was inedible .
you fooled me once linda .
shame on me .
in fact it was almost like they did n't want us to buy anything .
they do n't seem to care about our business .
they were rude , unhelpful , and about an hour and a half late .
they did n't think any of this was a problem .
i ordered _num_ tons of rocks and scheduled a 7am delivery time .
very frustrated with this place and will never use them again !
it sucks when it 's easier to go to home depot .
the employees here need some serious training .
i had a terrible experience here .
the cheap bag they gave me fell apart when carrying it into the house .
original is a faded yellow and they used a shiny bright yellow .
looks totally sloppy .
$ _num_ for every little sewing job .
no one answered and i did not leave a message .
do not bring your clothes here ; price and time length is unreasonable .
i ca n't stand sprint .
the insurance only covers a direct replacement .
so why _num_ stars ?
no problems at all .
sorry for the _num_ stars but that 's all sprint deserves anymore .
employees are slow .
and just all around poor customer service .
how this store stays open , i have no idea .
the fact that angel lied to get a sales is sleazy !
hey , sprint , you guys need to close this store .
seriously , do anything you can to not come into this specific store .
yeah , no thanks .
the sprint service sucks too much for me to want to pay more .
i hate when people act like i do n't know what i 'm saying .
worst customer service because i have no answers .
do n't waste your time here ... or with sprint for that matter .
i 've since discovered they are worse .
are you kidding me ?
wow was i wrong .
wrong , again .
this is by far the worst sprint store !
as everyone else has stated , it is filled with a bunch of liars .
do not use this store .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
everytime im in here staff is extremely rude .
i will not be visiting this store again due to employee 's .
wouldnt recommended sprint or this location to my worse enemy .
do n't use sprint !
the phone purchasing process and service was fine ( explaining the _num_ stars ) .
i would strongly recommend against getting a mobile hot spot , however .
i seriously hate this store .
my phone is broken and ca n't turn on !
do n't waste your time here !
sad to say , i 'd totally opt for subway .
the prices are reasonable but the choices are slim .
we 're talking ham , turkey , italian , that 's about it .
nothing special whatsoever .
wow .
i did n't find what i was looking for and left without buying anything .
i think i 'll stick to the other two stores i normally go to .
there was no apology or explanation given .
Neutral
if i could rate this shop a negative _num_ star rating i would .
in summary , stay far far away from this place .
rude and dishonest staff , terrible service , awful experience .
Very negative
negative stars !
last time i was there he was very short and rude .
_num_ stars ?
this business does n't put care , soul , and heart into their work .
after i came back they fixed it without even saying sorry .
this is not type of people i want to do business with .
i do n't recommend this business .
they just seemed clueless about my car .
the quiche was burned ( blackened crust ) , she brought it out black .
she brought out a second quiche , which was undercooked and very soggy .
the inside has a slightly funky odor , like spoiled cheese and cheap wine .
the owner was a sour faced jerk who demanded to know what i wanted .
also they can get you in quickly for your initial visit and follow-up visits .
i do n't regret going to him , but i ca n't recommend him .
i was sent to collections without even getting my last bill in the mail .
they can no longer be treated with antibiotics .
so a total of _num_ teeth .
ridiculous .
condescending and arrogant does n't even describe it .
but let me warn you now to run , run , run !
i 'm not at all surprised by elizabeth w. 's post .
um , i 'm getting oral surgery here , lady .
do i look like the guy from a million little pieces ?
_num_ 's this place was the best club around .
now it 's the worst .
we tried asking the servers to bring us some dancers , and nothing .
they would look at me and then pass on to the next table .
just was n't couple friendly at all .
throwing money out on stage was just a waste .
was not even offered lap dances .
i must say i was let down once i stopped in to visit .
i could n't tell if he was happy or upset about it ?
haha the drinks were a little over priced as well .
was decent .
so it is very easy to get to .
we went on a saturday and it was a $ _num_ cover per person .
anyways there are way better clubs to go to in phx .
do n't even bother going here now .
do n't waste your money here .
after all the good reviews i have to say i was disappointed .
we paid _num_ dollars for nothing but disappointment .
ca n't quite figure that one out .
never had anything like this before .
the restaurant is in need of a makeover and is very outdated .
it is dreadful .
we love chinese food , and the food is definitely delicious .
however , we have issues every time we place an order by phone .
i let that roll off my shoulder and accepted the delivery order .
i said no to give us a few minutes .
not good at all , we were rushed the whole time we were there .
unfortunately , they missed the mark , badly .
the peanuts might have been pan fried , there was n't enough to tell .
the chicken was equally lacking .
fail , fail and fail .
have n't been to the restaurant in ten years .
the crab puffs were much better with plenty of cream cheese .
the chicken was too dry and only a couple of ship which tasted old .
the food had too much msg .
our food was worse !
maybe these people just do n't know what real good chinese food is .
the chicken wings gave me food poisoning .
will avoid in the future .
got my money but not my order .
_num_ minutes later i called and was placed on hold for _num_ minutes .
i hung up , called back and was told the driver had the order .
so on top of really poor service i had been lied to as well .
poor service .
worst service ever .
let me first say , i like frank 's food .
i was hoping it was a one time thing .
so lazy employees decide to take off early .
this way , they might get something right .
at this point , it 's just overpriced greasy food .
the worst pizza i have every had in my life .
honestly , i do n't know how they are still in business .
we were having a few kids sleep over and everyone voted for pizza .
after _num_ minutes , still no food .
could n't do it ... again because we ordered through a third party .
never complain about food before it comes out of the kitchen .
( remember that our _num_ year old is still waiting there . )
it just tasted funky .
truly awful .
i ordered a large pizza and some cherry chipotle bbq wings .
they forgot to cut the pizza , which was kind of annoying .
overall , just overpriced and not that great .
however the pizza was like cardboard with burned cheese , and bland .
that was unacceptable , as i am never ordering from them again .
the pizza was ok but the service was terrible .
if i could give this place _num_ stars i would .
i have never had a worse experience in my life .
absolutely horrible service .
no apology , and pizza was rubbery from sitting in the warmer too long .
what a waste of time and money .
the flavor was n't anything to write home about ... .
it was just `` eh '' .
too bad , was a pretty good pie .
the delivery was not good .
worst pizza place ever .
completely got my order wrong ; could n't find it when i called in .
i wish there was an option for zero stars !
this place has the worse service and even more terrible delivery service !
they were extremely rude and not helpful at all !
do n't use their service .
the worst .
i took half a day off from work to meet eddie this morning .
he first told me that he asked my wife how dirty the carpet is .
not sure what that means , but that was never asked .
no dirt ) for my new tenant .
the conversation ended with john finishing yelling at me and promptly hanging up .
their area code on an online advertisement said _num_ ( n scottsdale ) .
do not buy this groupon !
they showed up late and made me wait .
there van broke down in my driveway .
bought the groupon thinking it was a steam cleaning ... umm no .
i have already emailed groupon to get a refund .
i wish i could give this _num_ stars .
no apology given for being _num_ hours late .
_num_ hours more rolled by , and no one came .
every number on the groupon was for technicians , though .
so i wait for him to call , and he does not .
then he hung up on me .
but on the very bottom shelf .
we did n't have any problems getting our money back or store credit .
i could n't understand the lady , either .
and of course i later found that they gave me the wrong store number .
this manager was seriously trying to cover her butt .
she went to a computer and did stuff and even made a phone call .
get over it and get on with your life . ''
zero stars for the `` doctor '' but one for the nice office .
one of the worst customer service experiences i 've ever had .
this place is absolutely the worst .
yet the same woman was there trying to convince me that it was fine .
i think she just wanted to get me the hell out of her shop .
i had to come back _num_ times but she came back _num_ times .
horrible customer service and poor workmanship !
this place is old , furniture is ugly , rooms are dark and smelly .
this is not your typical embassy suites .
that turned out to be the problem .
long story short we got little sleep during the four night stay .
front desk said they could not move us because they were full .
people smoked around the pool and spa despite kids playing .
they would smoke outside our room and our non smoking room would smell .
there was freshly cut fruit and condiments of all kinds .
_num_ ) $ _num_ / day parking fee .
_num_ ) the hot water in the shower took forever to heat up .
it was about _num_ minutes , no joke .
the internet was n't fast and the connection would die quite often .
_num_ ) very little counter top space at the bathroom sink .
rooms would not even get cool .
will not be staying there again .
cheap .
it is not your average embassy suites .
they should really make this a motel _num_ .
this place is really old and dated .
luckily i only had an one night stay that was paid by my company .
the free breakfast is not worth it .
very much in need of a complete overhaul .
would not recommend this for a long stay .
i booked a suite ( not jr suite ) .
the girl was so rude !
i was not pleased .
and why do n't you have silverware in a kitchenette ?
not very nice .
probably wo n't be back .
not going back again until they remodel their looks .
this embassy suites is ok .
did n't like this place .
the neighborhood was iffy and i was scared to leave the hotel after dark .
the room was dated but clean .
wo n't be back .
this place is n't all that well kept .
the only reason to stay here is if you do n't have a choice .
for me it was a company meeting .
the heating did n't work .
still no heat in our room after two nights .
third night we demanded another room .
no heat .
do n't stay in this hotel unless you are looking for freezing cold rooms !
terrible .
the interior is outdated .
that did n't really start things off well .
so shoes had to be worn inside the room .
it was the most disappointing room i 've ever stayed in .
do not stay here unless breakfast is your only concern .
not bad of a hotel location , great breakfast .
rooms are quite large if you 've stayed in a embassy suites before .
hot water lasted only a very sort while ( 10-15 min max ) .
only issue we had during our two day stay was the noise .
there 's a loud slam from the gate which is easily heard .
the cons - its nothing like you 'd expect an embassy suites to be .
first , i was placed in a dirty room on the second floor .
that was fixed by maintenance within about _num_ minutes to an hour .
gross .
next , i went to get my complimentary breakfast .
if i had not been here on business , i would have left .
how dirty , disgusting , and rude !
i had a horrible stay !
not of embassy quality - very poor property .
old and run down .
first room had big fan in the room , trying to dry the carpet .
i opened closet door and it smelled of sewer .
no restaurants within walking distance .
by default , only decent food is in bar restaurant .
there is nothing very nice about this properly .
found out ( after i got there ) that it was built in _num_ .
in phoenix it was _num_ last week .
this place is horrible .
avoid at all costs !
terrible experience here .
i have stayed in another hilton property in az .
the shuttle drivers were nice though , so they have that going for them .
the rooms , grounds are extremely dated .
i on the other hand was given keys that did not open my room .
as though i 'm an inconvenience .
so i 'm given another room now on the second floor .
as i walk in i notice that the room was not cool at all .
everything is old , dingy , and smells of cigarettes .
so i will sleep tonight hoping my car is there in the morning .
in short , go elsewhere .
am i the only one who thinks pottery barn has gone down hill ?
the quality is not what it used to be .
`` are you sure it 's not just normal wear and tear ?
then why say it ? ''
the problem is not me , its you and your crappy dishes .
all of can say is they are rude !
i 'm a customer that has decorated my whole home with pottery barn furniture .
i had n't been able to find the plastic packaging they were in .
blah blah blah .
yes , she did let me return them .
has any and every sales person not seen pretty woman ?
sales lady looked us up and down and walked away .
lost a large sale today , again .
horrible customer service .
as a young adult i felt that i was ignored by staff .
this is disappointing to me .
horrible experience here .
it 's small crowded and hard to navigate .
not everything has a price tag that is easy to spot .
they have some nice pieces , however the place has no personality .
the other thing that gets me is that they have _num_ locations .
this sucks .
i could not wait to get home to write this review .
this time was different , though .
the employees at the lincoln and scottsdale store are rude and dishonest .
i do n't get it .
and had to e-mail her as no one had a records of these items .
no wonder she is opening another store in san diego ha !
be very careful !
it did not fit on my patio , just too big .
i was responsible and i knew it .
it was less than _num_ hours later .
it was and is not a good business practice .
i will not be shopping there again .
this has been a huge mess .
_num_ . )
was told everything had been sold .
_num_ ) called the store again .
_num_ ) i said `` that table did not sell for $ _num_ .
_num_ ) several weeks have passed .
but then their quality really sucked .
_num_ days later i ca n't open the door from the inside .
so instead of getting a professional installation i got some half as $ workmanship .
so i did the repair myself .
i do n't want to take away from that .
this is update to review submitted in _num_ .
very disappointing .
in a word , greedy .
no one at best western will refund my money .
they have not returned my phone calls or emails .
neither of these companies care about their employees and is a complete joke .
i do not recommend working here .
is is awful customer service , and the people do not wear gloves .
when i picked up the order , it was a 1/4 sheet cake .
i 'm not a happy customer .
i am really sad .
he totally ignored me and started helping another customer .
it was sad .
probably not , i need some enthusiasm with my deserts .
overall , a very disappointing adventure .
unfortunately - worst customer service in the world .
it 's a shame .
no apologies for the mistakes both times .
on one occasion , they completely forgot about the order .
unbelievable .
customer service was terrible .
poor performance and total confusion at the shop .
the decorations were very plain , underwhelming .
the cake tasted bland and boring , price was absolutely not worth it .
would not recommend .
when we had out celebration that afternoon , it became clear .
they did not respond until thursday evening and then lied about it .
i am so disappointed in this place .
some people should not be allowed to deal with customers .
i would barely even give this place _num_ star .
that is too expensive for a simple oil change .
i wo n't be back .
i was surrounded by really weird employees running around in a state of chaos .
stay away from this creepy out of control business .
they told me my new cost would be $ _num_ .
like novelty t-shirts and stripper gear .
they have very limited inventory .
i 'm not on the walking dead here .
this is the worst company to deal with .
i mean , this is a health issue .
horrible company .
i asked them _num_ times to get it done and got nowhere .
she was very annoyed that we did not know what we wanted .
she was very rude and loud , do you have a border 's card ?
she never followed up to find out .
you know , picture of a flower , your dog , etc .
i called them a month later , they cancelled it and sent another .
no fancy card for me .
i 'm not kidding when i say it could have been an easy fix .
they do n't even pretend over at the old camelback location .
very rude !
i am leaving them by the end of this year .
disgusting .
i mean , cheap , fast , mexican food and its close by .
but ... i wanted to like this place and i ca n't .
kinda scary , actually , as one reviewer put it .
is everything frozen and reheated ?
did n't seem that way , as i said my taco was pretty good .
most everything else about this place is unimpressive , but passable .
i order a chicken burrito with fundido and verde sauce .
no beans , just rice please .
wrong answer , jesus .
word to the wise : get the attitude in check , jesus .
this was a huge disappointment .
i will say the cheese crisp was pretty disappointing .
salsa is n't spicy anymore .
this place is very overrated .
service was not good , and the food was not good .
so awful .
only reason i gave it two stars was because of the drinks .
worst food ever .
do n't waste a cent at this place .
first you could n't even tell what you were eating .
this manuel 's falls short of the other .
i asked our waiter this last time for a dessert menu .
he brought the regular menu that had no desserts on it .
out of those _num_ times , only once was the service half way descent .
very disappointed in this place .
first time going and we probably wo n't be back .
the service was terrible and the food was as well .
only positive thing about this place was the margaritas .
the manager barely helped .
sales folks are pushy and not helpful .
i ca n't stress to you enough not to go to this car wash .
had not been wiped down at all .
find a better car wash !
it was n't very deep , and mostly damaged the clear coat .
terrible customer service .
poor quality of service and product .
i would not recommend to anyone !
i would never recommend this car wash to anyone .
my girlfriend has been going to this car wash for _num_ years .
unbelievable .
charge me for it ?
when i parked again i decided i should 've walked around the whole truck .
they had not raised the back window and cleaned under it .
remember this was a $ _num_ hand wash and wax .
this is my third and last attempt to use this car wash .
first time here and they locked the keys in the car .
needless to say , i 'm taking him to court .
my floors still looked like it was n't vacuumed either .
this was my first time visiting this car wash .
it has always been my car wash and they never disappointed .
biggest mistake was not watching them vacuum and wax .
i know this was n't a full detail but leaving a sloppy mess ?
i have been to simple cleanings that have done a better job .
very bad experience here .
so disappointing .
never going back .
- we have been using this car wash for years and that ends today .
usually it is clean and done in a timely manner .
if you do n't know about the car , please just wash it only .
it cost $ _num_ to replace .
longest and worst wax job i ever had !
i called and spoke with daniel about getting my money back .
this is not a `` self car wash '' per their yelp category !
there were also water marks left on both side of my doors .
i returned immediately and was told i would receive a phone call from them .
no stars for this place.
i also go hung up on .
i usually just get a carwash .
told me it would take about _num_ minutes .
unfortunately i will not be back because of tony !
very unhappy with the service i received here .
needless to say i will not be back .
they really pressured me to upgrade and add leather conditioner .
ripoff .
but no .
this place was a complete let down .
though it is close to my home i will not be returning .
not worth my time or money .
makes me feel uncomfortable because i really want to be able to shop there .
horrible service .
i will not let this go lightly .
okay , so as a company , i have never really minded gucci .
if i could give them zero stars i would .
worst customer service experience of my life .
clearly , she went in the back and put a hole in it herself .
i 've had several disappointing experiences here .
sadly , i get the opposite here .
the purse was only a month old .
however , i followed the rules and let them send it into the factory .
this time it left me without a purse on my work trip .
i was very disappointed with how gucci in scottsdale treated me .
during a second experience , i had gucci sunglasses with scratched lenses .
i have been shopping gucci for years vegas , california , new york .
i walked in ready to buy .
they followed us around acting like we were going to steal .
game over , do n't want to deal with this any more .
horrible customer service and indifferent sales associates .
the customer service is horrible .
horrible service .
rude employees , avoid the store like the plague !
wow was the customer service horrible .
like , within ten minutes of leaving this place .
it was a very romantic anniversary , let me tell you .
simply because i 've never been so sick .
eh , i 'm torn .
at this price point , i can think of several much better steak houses !
ruth chris did not meet my expectations .
no complaints about the service or the atmosphere .
do not go to this restaurant if you ca n't use stairs .
i 'll never visit a ruth 's chris again !
and , the price tag at ruth 's chris , so not worth it !
are you kidding me ?
that is not an entre !
when i further inquired , he only talked more about their feature .
i could have received better service at applebee 's if you ask me , .
took my wife to ruth chris 's steakhouse for our anniversary .
we ordered steak of course , with garlic potatoes and some veggies .
the potatoes were good , but the steak was just average at best .
it was n't juicy enough or moist .
it did n't melt in my mouth either like texas roadhouse 's steaks .
nothing special .
the meal was over $ _num_ , which really was n't worth it .
and do n't talk to me like i 'm _num_ years old .
_num_ star - not going back !
ok , i just do not get this place .
when we were finally seated , the waiter was snooty .
i was super hungry and expected something to be comped .
can we say very limited menu ?
looking at the prices , i was expecting a more seasonal selection .
she barely even knew what the daily specials were !
umm yeah had to pass on the _num_ dollar strip steak special .
had the french dip ( _num_ dollars ) , which was pretty good .
for the price and poor service , wo n't be going back .
mediocre and overpriced .
the roasted chicken was on the greasy side but well seasoned .
american food i can make better in my own home .
i expect more from professional chefs than chicken sandwiches and steaks .
her attitude was unacceptable .
my club sandwich was mediocre at best , nothing special .
i just left .
i have to say , wow how bad can you get .
it took another _num_ minutes to get our change .
i wish i could rate the food but not tonight .
i loved houston 's but i 'm not sold on the new hillstone .
customer service was terrible so i left .
i felt no need to try the food for fear of more terrible service .
long and short of it .
service was awful .
i really liked the ambience of houston 's , busy , but not loud .
the hawaiian rib-eye was however tough .
another issue was the check was short by $ _num_ when it arrived .
took over _num_ minutes to get it cleared up .
this place must be under new management and wait staff .
a small quality step down from across the street .
my water glass was empty almost half the evening .
that ran out too , and sat for ages .
but we felt uncomfortable and , frankly , kinda played here .
houston 's was too good not to .
disappointment named salad .
never have to worry .
salad = worst .
are we that pretentious hillstone ?
it does n't go anywhere .
i will focus on my biggest disappointment .
whatever else i ordered , the veggies were a `` must . ''
now , the portion is smaller , and the cauliflower is rubbery .
the entrance is nearly impossible to find .
wo n't be back there any time soon .
the mrs ordered the hawaiian ribeye with a weird lemon flavored caesar salad .
the hawaiian ribeye was thinner than most ribeye cuts and had a hawaiian sauce .
my mom was still in town when i gave it another chance .
ca n't say no to mom , right ?
$ _num_ for a side salad .
i 'd been to hillstone twice , once for lunch and once for dinner .
i wo n't be back .
i had to empty the sand out of my shoes several times .
i wish hillstone would get it .
such potential - such a disappointment .
it was n't bad , it just could have been better .
stopped in for lunch last week and was very disappointed .
first off it is hard to find the hostess desk .
finally a waiter stopped by but he literally just stood there .
the food was not that good .
it was just awful !
of course our `` wonderful '' waiter failed to inform us of this .
the spinach artichoke dip was extremely greasy .
try the capital grille right down the road .
i 've never had a bad experience there .
i was probably shooting a little high .
the chicken caesar salad is supposed to come with croutons and it did not .
my co-worker and i should have sent the salads back .
i will definitely not be back to the restaurant .
overall i was disappointed with my first dining experience at hillstone .
not such a great place .
their insurance company is not very nice to deal with .
just awful ; service food ... the whole thing .
food was cold and poor quality .
service , they just did n't care .
we were extremely disappointed and will be taking our business elsewhere .
this has always been one of our go too restaurants .
this was just flat out rude and very disappointing .
since when should you feel rushed to finish your bottle of wine .
not sure we will go back .
we sure miss houston 's in the biltmore .
went to meet my mom for lunch last friday with my little guy .
she suddenly became very worried we were going to `` tell '' on her .
he quickly apologized and offered to buy us our drinks .
we will be back to city hall , not so sure about hillstone .
truly a shame .
not the same in volume nor flavor .
c'mon hillstone ... step up !
everything i saw was priced like nothing i had seen before .
i will not be back to try anything else .
try another restaurant in the area .
i was terribly upset with this restaurant .
they serve a caesar salad which is served as a whole leaf .
they refused saying it does n't look as good .
high prices and no regard for customer satisfaction is a bad combination .
cold night in phoenix .
party of _num_ sit at the patio for drinks and relax before dinner .
manager says we ca n't have _num_ chairs at our table .
it 's not a fire or safety risk .
... out of prime rib .
service slow .
pricey , ambiance was very nice but just not my cup of tea .
the atmosphere was great , but the food was bad !
very disappointed !
the worst service i have had .
the mojito was horrible , we never got greeted .
two drinks , and two sandwiches for lunch .
$ _num_ plus dollars .
my date , a glass of chardonnay .
me , the veggie burger with kale salad .
it was ok but very messy and nothing special .
not impressed .
if there was a zero that would be too much right now !
okay this pissed me off !
it 's season _num_ with attitude .
nothing new or original on the menu .
not impressed .
unless she did n't know what she was talking about .
this review is solely based off of the pretentious atmosphere .
he sat down with us in the booth .
but if anything larger is available then that would be amazing .
i made a reservation for _num_ and we were n't sat until almost _num_ .
although the filet was seasoned so perfectly , the salmon was bland and fishy .
a few times throughout our dining experience here , our water was empty .
unpleasant experience when you spend $ _num_ on dinner .
i most likely wo n't be back .
i will not return for a second visit .
she loved hers as did i when i had it .
she sent the manager over who was also low personality and very snooty .
no communication skills at all .
this store is too busy .
luckily before purchasing my mac i researched until i knew exactly what i wanted .
the experience itself was more than frustrating .
f me running .
i tell them i want to return this , i tell them why .
any fool can see it never came out of the box .
so i repeat why i am returning it .
so i wait and he returns with what i assume is the manager .
i have no problem with that , never did , never said i did .
i hated that my first impression was a line of people .
so no more lines at the front .
but wait , i need to pay for my item .
first , they want to know how i 'm planning to pay .
but if not , good luck finding someone to take your money .
_num_ .
ca n't tell you how much i hated the experience .
i hate all apple stores .
i ended up throwing my purchase onto the table and walking out .
i think apple looks for these guys to work in their stores .
the place was n't busy at all , and i had no questions .
not so fast .
this apple store is smaller than any of the others i 've been to .
this was a bit disappointing .
last time i waited _num_ minutes to ask a question about a laptop .
i went into this location today to have a problem with my iphone fixed .
you really left me no choice .
the `` help '' i received at this apple store was laughable .
we found a guy , but he was hostile and rude .
they really did n't care about serving their customers .
they were very helpful .
i will avoid these stores like the plague .
less apple peeps at this one just standing there looking cool doing nothing !
worst customer service !
but they do n't care !
i even spoke to a manager and he would not exchange my defective device .
it was 7:30 and the line was out the door .
they got me in and out quickly for my appointment at the genius bar .
this is the worst apple store i 've ever seen .
both appointments took way longer than they should have because they were so understaffed .
employee kind of got defensive when i called him on his lack of professionalism .
could use some training in customer service .
being rude definitely runs in the store .
i would not be sorry if this location shut down .
this is by far the worst apple store i have ever been too .
the customer service is awful , i have never dealt with such unprofessional people .
not enough personnel to support the customer .
appointments do n't mean nothing here .
personnel hygiene is non existent for the apple employees .
i had a guy that was really just not friendly .
talked to me like i was just an idiot .
worst experience i 've ever had .
freaking ridiculous !
worst customer care ever !
so disappointing !
very frustrating experience , poor customer service , not even the slightest bit apologetic .
of course the overly pierced hipster stopped us dead in our tracks .
it would take _num_ min tops to just switch the phone and pay .
zero customer service , rude , very unhelpful service .
i show up _num_ minutes early to my appointment time and check in .
might be switching my products out in the near future .
if you make an appointment for a customer , be available for the appointment .
apple 's `` service '' is abysmal .
the customer service , however , i had a big issue with .
he was very unprofessional .
this is ridiculous .
the employee then replied , `` well , we do n't do that here .
i ca n't help you '' , and walked away .
horrible customer service .
poor customer service .
the staff were a little rude and arrogant .
she was unable to explain the issue we had with our ipad .
worst customer service experience ever .
the worst customer service available .
unable to catch phone calls , text , emails basically anything .
very disappointing that people can not even manage a calendar .
horrible !
just completely horrible service .
all they wanted was more freaking money
this negative review is for apple the company not necessarily this store .
why i think that apple has phenomenal products that make my life easier .
beyond disappointed in this apple store .
this was the first apple store to be rude and unhelpful .
i waited _num_ minutes , and talked to a rep for only five .
also did n't deserve advice on where else to go .
i told him about my experience and he told me he would follow up .
my first visit here though , things started happening that sent red warning messages .
first visit , they did not have paperwork from my previous dentist .
i can only assume the request was done at the last minute .
that 's over $ _num_ more than what i was told .
unhappy .
this location is terrible .
you 've been warned !
i got my brakes done and just _num_ months later they were toast .
they took my _num_ and now wo n't honor fixing their crappy job .
this ordeal lasted over a week , dealing with multiple employees and manager .
at this point , we just want to pick it up .
pretty ridiculous .
he was great , but sadly there were too many other things wrong .
overall the experience was poor to be nice about it .
i dropped off my truck to have a window motor and oil change done .
that this was the source of the sound and asked for another $ _num_ .
obviously they did not do the work at all .
i for one will never be bring my car to sun devil auto again .
but it obviously did not work .
overpriced and lost my trust right away .
as a potential new costumer , i wo n't be back .
if i could give this pharmacy zero stars i would have .
meaning we are paying for the services .
with employees like these they may go out of business .
i would not recommend their service to anyone .
do not come here if you are looking for customer service .
in fact , i 've had one for _num_ straight days .
_num_ minute wait ?
it 's been a long day anyway , and this is the final stop .
after all , the overhead lights hurt my eyes .
stupid pharmacy .
ugh .
worst customers service .
in general , the stores never have stock on hand that is on sale .
me and my boyfriend shop here all of the time .
these characters that call themselves pharmacist and and pharmacy techs are the worst people .
avoid this pharmacy like the plague .
slow service .
yes they honored my warranty on my car battery .
it took less than _num_ minutes to find everything .
once i 'm bought a battery they told this one clerk to install it .
he said `` why do i 'll have to install all the batteries ?
then i 'll asked him to check the fluids .
morning crew not helpful .
the manager was standing right there so i asked if he could help me .
he said to let the man who was ignoring me do his job .
i remember very little about the meal because the service was horrible .
for a dinner that cost more than $ _num_ -- i certainly expected more .
i have no idea why people are raving about this place .
it is extremely over-priced for what you get out of it .
there are so many better restaurants in this area that are less expensive .
yes they were tasty , no they were not amazing .
when it came out , i did n't even see a hint of pink .
the cocktail waiter offered no wine suggestions .
we were extremely disappointed .
wrong .
we went for sunday brunch this past weekend it was about _num_ % full .
both dishes were tasty but there was hardly anything on the plate .
still , i wo n't be going back .
there are better brunch places out there for the money .
putting a high price tag on a plate does not make it good .
too much for a weak and sad plate of out of date food .
no wonder there was valet out front !
hello , sir , i do n't allow frozen drinks here either .
restaurant week _num_ .
this meal was a disaster !
terrible service ... totally non existent service .
food incredibly lacking in flavor .
pecan pie smothered in caramel sauce .
he was n't part of the entertainment .
will never waste money there again .
nothing to look at on outside .
valet charges $ _num_ ... okay .
inside , it 's like an older , dated , run down french restaurant .
tables were not exceptionally comfortable , were close together .
wait staff was just okay .
not formal enough , nor timely .
not unfriendly , but not friendly either really .
for the main course , i had the boar ( $ _num_ ) .
my wife had the three fish entree ( $ _num_ ) .
the sauce was the only thing great about the entree .
but at $ _num_ , i expect to be `` wowed '' .
my bill was $ _num_ before tip .
i surely wo n't be back .
does n't look good .
it should have felt like an upscale restaurant , but it did n't .
my husband and i probably went with the least interesting choices .
the lobster was just ok , the basil pasta was overcooked .
and none of the main entrees were under $ _num_ .
there were two dining areas and we were placed in the larger room .
several tables were available , so i did n't understand the long wait .
we sampled the duck tamales .
unfortunately , there was nothing special about this dish .
it was n't great , but it was n't horrible either .
we both started laughing at how horrible everything had been .
no second chances for this place - no thanks !
please be advised that the bad reviews are indeed true .
we immediately ordered martinis to try and ease the mood .
the parking lot is also a joke like a previous person had reviewed .
send it back and get the other wine which is just ok .
overall , it is not on my return list .
really needs attention from its chef owner .
what a disappointment .
dirty plates , coffee was horrible and the water tasted like linen .
no member of my family will ever step foot near this establishment again .
the salmon quesadilla was much better .
the tenderloin was decent but a bit overcooked and not inspired .
the portion sizes of these plates were underwhelming .
the chocolate tart was the best dessert on the prix fixe menu .
they do n't tolerate menu questions for special events .
it appears mr. vincent takes the cheap way out !
their wine list was extensive but grossly over priced .
needless to say i will not be returning nor suggesting this place to anyone .
very disappointing .
_num_ of us dined and everyone of us had a bad meal .
terrible service , nobody managing what is going on .
_num_ more minutes passed slowly by .
still no acknowledgement .
no we will not be returning .
tacky .
how embarrassing , after telling everyone that this was one of my favorite restaurants .
we spent hundreds of dollars on dinner and wine .
i walked in to the main counter , and a waiter approached me .
he told me it would 10-15 mins for my party of three .
i have never seen this at any restaurant before .
first off , i 've been here before .
this time could not have been more opposite .
often for different parties , so you can imagine the confusion .
and sit we did for _num_ minutes without water or menus .
_num_ minutes later , no joke , we got our croissants .
then _num_ minutes later came our cheese plate .
i had the runner take it back and continued to wait for my plate .
we received not quite refills about _num_ minutes after we received our plates .
it was busy , but i have been a server before .
it 's too bad .
service is okay and the ambiance is n't quaint when cleanliness is questionable .
the bacon was okay but definitely reheated .
coffee is so-so , was n't very strong , but tasted good .
are you kidding me ?
i stayed , waited for my food , coffee and left later .
i completely understand , as i had a very similar experience !
you would think they would want to make a good first impression .
but not the coffee lady !
unbelievable .
my experience was nearly the exact same as the one dana m described .
my coffee was weak .
searching for a new primary care physician is difficult .
i 'm going to have to assume its family or something .
it had only been an hour wait getting in to examination room .
so embarrassing , especially when your sick .
and told me i could n't see the dr because of it !
the long waits where always enjoyable .
this place is awful .
the homeless guy on the corner would probably give you better care .
been going to this general physician for about _num_ 1/2 years .
assume you will need to plan an extra hour at least when going in .
prescription refills are slow .
why does it take my call to get them to process the refill ?
over $ _num_ out of pocket later i returned for my check up .
last year they called me said it was my time for a yearly exam .
the waiting room was nearly empty .
the noise in the hallway outside the room is dying down .
the exam was about _num_ minutes listen to my heart and said sounds okay .
i wasted _num_ hours it was the last time i went there .
no wait , office staff was friendly .
made me wonder the last time someone went through there with a little _num_ .
jesus christ , someone just get me to the ymca !
so many regulars , who said they signed up , were without spots .
total chaos .
they 'd probably lose my information and i 'd get screwed over , again .
i tried to describe the one i saw upstairs working out with a client .
i hate this place .
the cardio equipment is usually broken or about to be broken .
treadmills with torn pads or that literally stop moving at speed randomly in workout .
some equipment just goes missing , too .
i feel like i 've entered an 80s gym !
i wish and hope there 's some upgrades planned for this location soon .
i have been going to this _num_ h location for two years .
when i started it was decent , now it is terrible .
downhill all together .
that whole ordeal lasted a few weeks .
the only positive is the classes .
too bad there 's not an option for no stars .
as far as price goes , no complaints .
the gym in general does not feel clean .
i would avoid the men 's room at all cost .
this place could not be more poorly run .
the only reasons i continue to come here is _num_ location and _num_ price .
can i give it no stars ?
worst gym .
cardio equipment is old and usually broken .
staff sucks .
center caps from my wheels were stolen from the crappy parking lot .
really , it is gross and broken down .
there is always broken equipment .
old equipment that is usually broken .
there is always at least one broken machine , usually cardio .
the place is very dirty and smelly .
the ac never seems to be working .
i 'm considering driving to _num_ ave and bell .
my purse and phone were taken but not my car keys or smart water .
place is dated .
maintenance is clearly not a priority .
i inquired as to why maintenance was not a priority but received no response .
this place is falling apart .
the steam room smells like piss .
the sauna is dark and creepy with the boards in the ceiling falling out .
for shame _num_ hour fitness .
the place for the most part seemed clean but they could 've done better .
equipment is old and there are always 5-7 machines broke .
this is the worst location in the valley .
this place is a dump .
i used just one session .
and they refused to give me any money back .
hated losing that four hundred dollars .
very poorly maintained .
in no way is this equipment state of the art ... as claimed .
employees are late opening ... really ... it 's a mess .
horrible customer service .
they are unorganized and not very customer friendly .
tell your friends to avoid them too .
do not join !
no towels provided in the gym .
if not i am going to planet fitness for 1/4 the price .
well , wait , might as well go there anyway .
cheap , but dirty .
kinda disgusting .
well it 's been over _num_ yrs now an nothing has been done .
there machine has been broken since october .
literally , i 'm standing next to the guy about to crack up .
the staff is in not knowledgable , helpful , or responsive .
it 's extremely disappointing , to say the least .
are they helpful ?
no customer service whatsoever .
i guess standards for hiring have gone way downhill .
i wasted an hour of my day .
customer service here leaves a lot to be desired .
oh , sorry , that would make sense ... .
probably the worst paint department you can imagine .
so no one to help the customer right ?
this home depot poor service .
she said she would call the department and have someone there look for them .
i am standing there just waiting and my legs are hurting .
again , another long wait .
horrible customer service !
people around here do n't know where their own items are .
it was a nightmare .
if you need a door , go through them , not home depot !
super busy , all of the time .
if i could give this particular home depot zero stars i would .
pathetic !
this place is awful .
ryan and scott are not helping this store at all .
terrible customer service .
lily at the self checkout was rude and not helpful at all .
but their answers are mostly soooo lame !
huge thumbs down .
as of november _num_ , this place changed hands .
while everything i said before was true , not it is n't necessarily .
now , its just a divey bar in a bad neighborhood .
overall , i do recommend ice house tavern .
we really wanted to like this place , but left extremely let down .
you dont even have to travel to california .
mine was better , but i 've forgotten what it was .
it 's hard to get too mad though .
despite the confusion , it 's about the cheapest sit down restaurant around .
i am a vegan living in phoenix and need to get in here !
i wish i could give this place five stars , i really do .
our tea pot and water glasses were empty long before that .
the mushroom hot pot was ok but a little bland .
i liked the steamed dumplings , but the sauce was a bit odd .
i really wanted to like this place , but i ca n't .
we wo n't be going back unless they get a big overhaul .
not sure .
if you 're looking for vegan , this is not the best in town .
in fact , it fell quite short .
also , there was a bad odor in the air .
almost smelled fishy to me .
it almost made me lose my appetite to be perfectly honest .
by the way , did i mention prices are also higher at this location ?
$ _num_ was the cost of this dish -- for lunch !
prices are a couple dollars less at the glendale spot .
however , my complaint is that is all it was .
the soup too was only lukewarm , and very small cup size portion .
i feel bad writing a bad review , but honesty is my policy .
this restaurant is not wheelchair accessible .
restaurant itself feels like a converted fast-food joint .
i did n't hate it , it was okay .
the service is super slow .
there was no one to greet my fianc and myself when we walked in .
then she brought out water about 10-15 minutes or so later .
then about _num_ minutes after that we ordered .
i have an unhealthy obsession with dumplings .
the soy chicken could be tastier but the dish was pretty good , nonetheless .
and holy hell , they do not know what a sense of urgency is !
if you go , do not expect great service .
the atmosphere is weird !
i really would love to give a better rating to a vegan restaurant .
unfortunately , i was disappointed with everything .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i wonder why they are not closed yet .
so just too much peanuts not even other complimentary flavors .
i literally made a yelp account to give this place a bad review .
but it just was n't meant to be .
from entering to leaving it just was not a good experience .
once we put in our order it took _num_ minutes to be served .
this is simply unacceptable .
not wheelchair accessible and no handicap parking spaces .
fail !
left before ordering and wo n't return .
a shame as i was excited to try the food .
absolutely terrible and slow service .
the server dropped off my food and never gave me utensils .
bill was $ _num_ and i paid _num_ .
they gave me back dollar bills as if i should tip them .
i fucking hate this place and the incompetent people who run it .
i should have walked away without paying .
i work in a restaurant and i know when service is completely shitty .
this place has no redeeming qualities whatsoever .
service is why i ca n't give this place more than two stars .
and another _num_ min for mine !
anyway , that was our experience .
we would n't return , even if we did live in the area .
but we are most upset about the horrible customer service .
they did n't inform us that we had to pay extra for rice .
it was so confusing .
not a chance we will go back there .
it was such an incredibly rude service .
if i could give it zero star , i would .
very disappointed .
then another _num_ minutes and the second dish came out .
i 'm so disappointed with the service even though the food was great .
i will not be returning to this location at all .
my wife and her friend 's entree were nothing to write home about either .
needless to say we wo n't be back .
poor business practices at encore !
there is nothing listed in the paperwork that says you operate this way .
money is not an issue .
the rest of the organization is unorganized and not very welcoming .
i did n't have a coupon .
i could n't see a thing .
however , i will not be getting lenses from this establishment again .
Neutral
if there were negative stars i would leave it on this place .
do not go in there , no matter how sweet the deal looks .
this place was gross .
walked in on saturday and walked out .
if not , you will get a more epic review peter piper on thomas !
i think i got ripped off from the games at least _num_ times !
i do n't think i would recommend this place to anyone .
i would not recommend their pizza at all .
online ordering system sucks .
it is horrible & disgusting !
i 'm so disappointed that they have changed !
i booked this appointment a few weeks ago and have been waiting .
no sir , i am not requesting that .
_num_ mistakes i wish i never had done .
big mistake .
he called back but did n't leave a message .
driver showed up at _num_ when i was n't home .
if you have a choice , do not use this company .
it took me _num_ calls to get a hold of him .
terrible experience with this company .
several repair request were made throughout the year .
it was fixed but only for a few days .
however , by friday morning it was leaking again .
afternoon to an apartment with no a/c .
it was so unbearable to be in there .
no cooking , sleeping or any other things were able to be done .
still no a/c !
the management staff and management company lincoln properties do not care about their residents .
they explained it was company policy and would do it again .
the fried shrimp is too oily for my taste .
been to two of the locations and this one was not as good .
ordered kalbi ribs and they gave me the ribs but no meat attached !
rice was dry and hard from sitting for awhile .
i got the curry chicken and the bf got the bbq beef .
i probably would n't go back .
i go to this location fairly regularly and have never had a problem .
i get my order to go , the crispy shrimp plate .
( gross !
i do n't know if these things could make a person sick or not .
i really like ono 's mac salad and the katsu sauce with the shrimp .
maybe you should check your order before you leave .
we do n't put any sauce on any of our food .
this is ono hawaiian bbb and is not anything like hawaiian food .
worst `` hawaiian '' i 've ever had .
it was so gummy and tough !
seaweed is not supposed to be chewy like that !
disappointing , even if theirs did use onion .
avoid .
do n't waste your time or money .
not a big fan of rubber chicken and warm macaroni salad .
bbq chicken was a bland rubbery mess that the katsu sauce could n't help .
visit the much better hawaiian options in phoenix !
usually this place is good , but the customer service tonight was absolutely terrible .
i was pretty disappointed with this place .
the disappointing thing is that the drink was probably the best part .
do n't waste your time .
wear shoes because the floor is sticky .
with three people in the restaurant , that 's a little ridiculous .
not good .
i waited like _num_ or _num_ min longer than it usually takes .
the mac salad that people love so much had a fishy taste to me !
the beef was borderline gross with the texture and bad flavor !
steamed rice is steamed rice , it was ok !
the food is great , but their customer service is garbage !
seriously just avoid this location altogether .
my rice was so soggy and mushy .
after we ate we felt sick to our stomach .
it smelled so bad like sweaty mildew .
it was unbearable and i wo n't be back .
seriously just avoid this location altogether .
me today : panda express is crap .
gross , plain and simple !
what a waste of money !
but the customer service side sucks .
stale tasting .
outside of the freezer is the prep area with a large gray garbage can .
she stood there , asking her question , holding the garbage can .
then she and the manager walked back to me .
is that a garbage can ? ''
`` no , '' she replied .
she put the bowl down and walked away , washed her hands and apologized .
needless to say , i wo n't be coming back .
i wish i could say that my complaints are isolated to this single store .
like its the same sauce , just with different meats and sometimes vegetables .
the employee always look over work and seem to not enjoy being there .
i ca n't recommend this place as i avoid eating here myself .
at this point , the damage was already done .
i 've have been a customer for a long time .
most of the meat is made with alot of vegetables .
worse customer service ever !
they do n't do n't even pay attention to what you 're ordering !
hoping i do n't get sick off these .
the white rice was old and dry .
i wo n't be back .
i called in to ask for a refund and they refused .
im never going back there again .
the cheese was not melted inside .
asking me to pay cash ... whatever .
i 'm harsh ?
it was cold .
normally the are not bad .
bean and cheese burrito was awful .
the beans tasted like the canned beans you buy at the supermarket .
try filiberto 's instead .
some of them have daily specials running monday thru friday .
got horribly sick about _num_ minutes after i finished my meal .
just nasty .
egg tasted like it was cooked with engine oil .
but today the service was horrible !
we waited _num_ - _num_ mins for _num_ burritos !
no sense of urgency .
i had a visit in early _num_ and reported difficulty breathing .
two days later , nothing had been called in .
i followed up and was again told it was called in .
nothing was done , and i spent about _num_ minutes with the doctor .
it was downright rude and condescending .
an hour later still no food .
after some arguing she said she would not charge for the food .
she then called back three more times yelling that we had to tip her .
they said it would take _num_ minutes ... no problem .
the hot sandwich i ordered was cold and the bottom bread was totally soggy .
my biggest peeve in this world is soggy bread .
the quality of ham is disgusting .
it 's slimy and tastes like ham flavoring .
for a sandwich that costs this much , they need to use better product .
i was starving when i ordered it .
i ate a few bites and now it 's going in the trash .
i 'll pretend i just drank a $ _num_ soda .
so i gave them another chance .
i 've never tasted something so salty in my entire life .
i do n't even want to think about how much msg i just consumed .
still really grossed out about it .
food was most disgusting i have ever had in my entire life .
it was so bad that it literally fell apart when opening up my bag .
but nothing i did would get rid of that weird taste in my mouth .
let me say it , i love subway ... not this one .
sadly its the closest one to my apt .
i just threw the sandwich away .
i lost meatballs left and right and eventually just ate with a fork .
i also ordered a steak and cheese sub toasted .
my steak and cheese was n't even hot enough to melt the cheese .
terrible .
i was visiting phoenix a few weeks ago and i visited this bookstore .
those books are n't on shelves !
oh , and the books are way overpriced .
and i am not a fan of last chance .
a lot of stuff seemed damaged and the prices were n't all that great .
probably wo n't be heading back .
this store has a rude and miserable staff .
i was just in with my mother to buy thanksgiving dishes .
the same cashier said in a nasty tone , `` well we have baskets .
she was very rude to the customer .
they ruined our shopping day .
this gas station stole my fucking money .
granted it was only $ _num_ but it was the only cash i had .
if only there was an option for zero stars !
the most expensive and least competent gas station i 've ever encountered .
complete waste of time .
i will not be going back to this location anytime soon .
my last customer service experience was horrible .
which is too bad .
i would not even give this store _num_ star .
the store is dirty and is often out of most flavors .
this is no way to treat employees .
the owner does not care about his employees or customers .
it is such a shame because kids love getting ice cream .
shame on you !
overall , it was n't bad .
seriously only _num_ flavors ?
is n't it _num_ flavors in their name ?
each time they 've been out of mint n chip .
i left disappointed , irritated , unsatisfied , and out of $ _num_ .
i suggest cold stones or the gelato spot .
there is always a strange odor near the back of the building .
smells like piss but my husband thinks it smells like something soggy .
i have never been so disappointed in an oil change !
( i had it checked out at different place ) .
sears told me my engine could blow up at any moment .
these guys were just lazy and did not want to do any work .
they chose to scare me instead .
they checked and told me my tires were fine and they refilled my tires .
why the hell would i pay that for _num_ ?
i was flat out lied too .
i wish i could give them _num_ stars .
i paid top dollar for what i thought would be superior workmanship and service .
brian would not return our calls .
meanwhile the installer called to set up appointment another day .
when he showed it was the wrong door .
no reply .
customer service is very poor .
gross !
extremely disappointed .
he closed the box and handed it back to me .
he says , i do n't see that they put anything on it .
i 'm on my way to baja loco .
i prefer mine lightly battered and these were pretty heavily breaded and fried .
the first two bites did n't even have fish in them , just breading .
not so good is the sangria , which has a strange cardboard background taste .
well , it does n't taste so good coming back up .
while i waited _num_ min for my burrito , i saw _num_ major issues .
i would be very very cautious of this company .
they actually did not have any work .
stay far away from this company .
it is on 30th st and camelback .
they seem disorganized , and passed me off to multiple people .
too expensive for a haircut .
which is a $ _num_ savings compared with my last visit .
i would leave zero stars if possible .
i had one training class and the trainer left the gym .
stopped by this branch this morning on my way to work .
when i called to follow up , again , there was no answer .
they could not even offer that .
Negative
i hate to leave negative feedback , but i just was not impressed !
however once i stepped out of the reception area , i was instantly uncomfortable .
its hard to explain what made me uncomfortable ... maybe just me ?
un , no .
_num_ attempts and nothing .
yep , sure enough the cut was n't even in the back .
i dunno man .
hopefully your experience wo n't be like mine .
the cashier offered me another item which was almost _num_ dollars more .
and by the way , no one here says thank you !
are you kidding me ?
i wo n't be going back .
stay away from any western dental !
as a corporate dental company they do n't care about you as a patient !
they just want to make as much $ $ as they possible can .
we selected western dental due to my husband 's tooth pain .
i am not a good patient , but this was atrocious !
nothing was done about my complaint that the partial was n't fitting .
avoid at all cost !
so unprofessional from start to finish , literally a grade school level practice .
embarrassed to even set foot there .
very disappointed in the oral surgeon there .
i 've left several messages and no one will call me back .
this has been a joke from the get go .
please do not waste your time or your hard earned money with these people .
western dental still sucks !
they are no good and should be shut down !
the receptionists are very unprofessional .
with that said , i do n't like chipotle .
who am i kidding , i can take it or leave it .
this location is a royal pain .
do n't go - whatever you do - during lunch time during the week .
that 's just asking for trouble .
not worth it .
needless to say , i have n't been back .
that 's where i went wrong .
i had plans for the remains of the burrito i should have gotten .
chipotle claims they have gluten free food .
they have lost our frequent business forever .
i eat chipotle at least _num_ days out of the week .
there was not .
they do n't need and should n't ever have someone so rude up front .
the issue tonight was a matter of health .
simply put , the steak in my burrito bowl was grossly undercooked .
so undercooked that the meat was actually cold .
also , do n't expect a lot of lettuce in your salad .
i used the online ordering method to order my food for my lunch .
that is _num_ minutes for an order that was placed online .
this location is not as stellar as others .
this location on the other hand is terrible .
spend your money elsewhere .
this location sucks .
there will be _num_ or more employees standing around doing nothing .
like i get it , customer service is rough at times but chill out .
this is definitely the worst i 've ever been to .
the place was filthy and the staff was horrible .
horrible .
this is the worst chipotle location i 've ever been to .
they do n't hold up to the standards set by chipotle at all .
example : `` pico and hot salsa . ''
then they just put pico on and look at you .
`` sour cream , cheese , and lettuce . ''
i ca n't even figure out where one taco begins or ends .
so appetizing for $ _num_ .
if i wanted crap i would go to taco bell .
rice is almost always uncooked .
the staff is not very friendly at all .
the tables are almost always dirty because they seem to be under staffed .
ugh .
my food has been cold _num_ % of the time .
the other _num_ % they 've run out of something .
tonight they ran out of chips .
in order to avoid this sad restaurant .
please chipotle on thomas , your customers are begging you to make changes here .
why are you ignoring the hundreds of complaints ?
wipe that shit down quickly and then help your coworkers !
they mess up orders and they take forever !
this is unacceptable !
staff is slow and not interested in providing good customer service .
this location sucks .
not even worth _num_ star , will not return to this establishment .
_num_ people walked out in the _num_ seconds i was there .
assuming they just did n't feel like cooking anymore .
hands down one of the worst chipotle restaurants i 've ever been to .
online ordering is an absolute joke .
i love chipotle , but this location needs to hire a whole new staff .
they are slow , rude , and lack customer service .
worst chipotle experience i 've ever had .
all the chairs are upside down on the tables as though they 're closed .
i 'm offended and wo n't be back .
unfriendly staff and moldy grapes in kids meal .
this chipotle used to be good but , it 's not anymore .
and the cashier does n't say a word .
on more than one occasion they have been out of ingredients .
_num_ minutes for corn ?
are you kidding me ?
it should n't be that hard to keep _num_ or so ingredients filled .
why why why ca n't you just have all your food ready ?
is n't this why i come here ?
this chipotle is consistently horrible !
today i ordered _num_ bowls and they were all cold .
i went straight from the restaurant to the house .
_num_ minutes max .
_num_ % of the time the portions are less than a scoop .
save yourself the money and travel a little further for a better experience .
i have never been to a worse chipotle .
so disappointed .
i do n't want to get food poisoning .
guacamole was flat , no flavor .
the steak was horrible tough , is it always like that ?
just disappointing .
_num_ .
they opened _num_ minutes late , leaving several people waiting outside .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
overall vibe of the place sucked .
not friendly at all .
_num_ .
tables clearly had not been cleaned from the night before .
_num_ .
even the cashier , which surprised me .
rude staff , unclean place .
i hate yelp .
if you have a problem , talk to management .
but here 's the thing , i have .
do n't waste your time going here !
he would not have noticed anything without me saying something .
the rice is undercooked and hard .
i ca n't even chew the meat , its so tough .
when i got home , the lettuce on my bowl was all brown .
disgusting .
a waste of my money .
so apparently they do n't know how to make the rice !
not the best chipotle experience , probably wo n't return to this location .
the salads i bought had very little lettuce and the steak was dry .
overall im not happy with this location or the service i got .
i had the worst experience at this chipotle !
she was so rude .
horrible customer service !
i will no longer return to chipotle .
this location is often crowded and overwhelming ( long lines , feeling rushed ) .
like many yelpers have said , the portions here are pretty skimpy .
there was n't enough in the first place .
think i 'll go elsewhere next time .
chipotle just is n't worth it any more .
bottom line , i may or may not go back .
not good .
bland .
but i was n't expecting to be grossed out .
however , it was more expensive than other shops in the area .
also , i was not greeted or spoken to at all .
i 'm not a fan of being ignored .
doubt i 'll be back anytime soon , shame since it 's so close .
i hate to be so harsh but i feel pretty cheated .
guess where i wo n't be going to get it fixed ?
i said ok and got an uber to pick my girlfriend up immediately .
they got there money , what do they care !
no website .
the place was basically empty , only _num_ tables had people sitting .
sure , i would like _num_ slices with sausage to go please .
i was confused because they did n't close for another _num_ hours .
you 're a pizza place , how could you be out of pizza ?
the sausage was just placed on top of the pizza and was cold ?
why would they even package this for a customer ?
i ended up throwing the pizza in the trash and made a sandwich .
i guess they fake it less well than employees at other stores .
i have been in twice recently at night and the service has sucked .
that was too much for this guy apparently .
also , your a jerk .
employees too concerned with chatting behind the counter other than offering to help you .
staff is unhelpful , they acted like i was an inconvenience to them .
shipping is expensive too .
however i waited _num_ min to purchase one item .
to print _num_ sheets and to fax took _num_ min !
horrible !
wish i would have read the reviews first .
they did n't even apologize , they just made excuses .
she said no one !
then she said i 'll make a copy for you .
terrible customer service and bad attitude !
not a nice person at all !
would be no stars at this location .
horrible customer service .
the employees were just standing around and place had _num_ other customer .
unfortunately , no .
not good .
sorry but no .
but i wo n't be returning .
but my nails looked like absolute crap .
alas , no .
my massage was a complete waste of time .
in my opinion he used too much polish .
ugh .
if you go , stay away from the man technician .
i sat another _num_ min before i was seen by someone else .
they also did a poor job .
i will not spend my money somewhere that they do not value their customers .
do n't waste your time here .
worst manicure of my life , and the pedicure was n't much better .
stopped here because i was in the area .
boy was that a big mistake .
he is horrible and the way he did the polish what a joke .
never again will i go back there .
i probably could have done a better job .
extremely disappointed .
my daughter went here hoping to get her nails done for our vacation .
would not come back .
very low quality service .
even that is cheap price is so not worth it .
that was one of the worst pedicures ever .
she was a little aggressive with my fingers and not gentle at all .
i was so annoyed about how she rushed it .
it was so rushed '' .
she came back and said `` pedicure is _num_ min '' .
i want to say that pedicure was not _num_ try _num_ min .
i would never go there again .
i guess my money will bother him too .
or if she is just this rude to everyone .
she must not have seen the rock on my finger !
no thanks !
i am very upset at being treated in this manner .
like the other reviewer , i experienced constant delays .
to add to this , their billing is out of control .
though expensive , i was prepared for this .
they made big promises ... and failed in every aspect .
they have screwed up my international taxes _num_ years in a row .
this location is terrible .
i ca n't believe the customer service at this location .
either she was just having a bad day or she totally hates her job .
my sales associate lied to me .
so your rent changes every month ... it is never the same amount .
they landscaping sucks .
worst apartment complex ever .
i can hear literally every step my upstairs neighbors take .
it 's incredibly annoying .
im very disappointed in this unit .
worst leasing office !
are you kidding me ?
we refused to sign new lease and this is there mistake .
my roommate and i were furious no one notified us of this !
they gave us a list of how to prepare for treatment .
the leasing office just look at me like oh well .
i get a feeling like the staff does n't really want any business .
i ran home to get my dog , and brought him back .
needless to say , i left .
i ran home to get my dog , and brought him back .
needless to say , i left .
the cashier amanda is rude !
under her breath and walked away .
before you freak out at the _num_ star rating , let me explain myself .
on a tuesday night at _num_ , the lounge area was packed .
i could n't believe it .
it turned out she was the only server for the whole lounge !
um , ok ?
the tenderloin burger was very plain .
rarely did the server return to our table to check on us .
not worth it .
so there is absolutely nothing here i would eat .
no reason to return , whatsoever .
this place is way too expensive for the mediocre food served to you .
it 's not bad , but certainly not worth the price or the hype .
way too overpriced for the quality of food !
the food was alright , but certainly not _num_ star quality .
we sat with empty water glasses for almost _num_ minutes .
that 's not service , especially for what you pay !
$ _num_ spending ) for a holiday dinner this past christmas .
except this time , t. had performance anxiety and failed me .
$ _num_ for _num_ antipasto plates ?
do n't bother .
`` so what 's the problem '' you ask ?
( this part of the experience is very similar to buying time share ! )
but how much am i paying for this dish !
it 's only half a cut of the fish !
the food was just not that great .
and the dessert was just not up to par .
i only had a few bites and did n't want to eat more .
and do n't bother trying to make casual conversation with the patrons there .
no apology , no nothing .
so things did n't start out on the best of notes .
i started with the crab cake , which i did not care for .
dh had the short rib ravioli to start , and it was also bland .
for entrees , i had the paella and dh had the duck .
seriously ... could have been shared by _num_ people .
it was fine , i guess .
not horrible , but really not so great either .
i tasted it , and thought it was tough and flavorless .
we shared some chocolate dessert , which was good .
i would probably give it _num_ stars if i could .
what a disappointment !
unfortunately the magic stops right there .
the dining experience could only be qualified as very disappointing .
the whole entree tasted at best bland .
not the t cooks we use to know and love .
.
possibly the worst upscale dining experience i 've ever had .
so many things wrong from start to finish .
another thing i can not forgive is the lobster .
desserts were nothing worth writing about .
food and service are below average for this price level , period .
if i were alone , i 'd be probably waiting for service still .
the service is anywhere from poor to absent .
i love the spanish villa type architecture , however t cook is shockingly awful .
outrageously disappointing .
this used to be my favorite restaurant for special occasions .
my fish was overcooked and no apology made when i had it sent back .
thanksgiving dinner at $ _num_ per head was very disappointing last evening .
the food was just average at best .
the food was bland and uninspired .
we will not return here .
expect to leave hungry .
the portions are small and very expensive .
the mix it up bar is where i 'll be going next time .
out with the new , in with the old .
appetizer ( spanish octopus ) was first disappointment with more to come .
it 's been _num_ months .
had we not eaten there several times before we would never go back !
the problem was with the food .
i am very disappointed with my recent visit to t. cook 's .
the service was terrible .
the waitress did not appear friendly at all .
the bar did not seem classy at all .
again , extremely poor service .
we would have a drink empty and wait and have no waiter show up .
words can not describe just how wonderful the lamb and the steak were .
like i said the food was amazingly good but the service was very poor .
i will never visit this place again .
just a bland menu .
two types of fish , steaks , pork chop , saffron pasta .
disappointed from what it used to be .
no flavor just a plain tasting white fish .
the beet salad was ok , but i would n't get it again .
it was dry .
i wo n't return with this menu .
had desert and a cup of coffee ... $ _num_ !
service was good , atmosphere was a little dark but ok .
not sure why you would cut a piece of meat like that .
it also had no seasoning on the meat at all .
at _num_ $ i expected a little more .
if asked to go again i will skip it .
very expensive and very disappointing both times .
our server was lots of fun and very professional , but a little slow .
the menu is pretentious .
wait we are in phoenix .
terrible terrible terrible !
Neutral
we would give it _num_ ( or negative ) stars if we could !
booked thanksgiving dinner for _num_ people a week in advance .
confirmed the reservation _num_ days in advance for a private room .
wrong .
gave away our room !
we could n't believe it .
fell far short of expectations .
they offered incredibly weak compensation , but of course this was a wash .
guess we really were sol .
the presence of a television nearly ruins the otherwise perfect environment .
went to t cooks with my dad for christmas eve and was disappointed .
this was the most offensive part of the meal .
the dessert was fine but nothing to write home about .
but they are so short staffed .
do n't get me wrong , they were working their tail off in there .
helped ourselves to our purchased water bottle put on service tray several tables away .
had caesar salad w flat iron steak .
it was n't flat iron .
seemed like bad tough cut of sirloin .
i spent $ _num_ on a bagel , cream cheese , and a coffee .
nope , not worth it .
especially since their coffee tastes like watered down crap .
: ( i will not be coming back anymore .
so , if you are going to this location , i warn you .
some of the employees do n't pay attention .
first , no salt bagels .
are n't salt bagels one of the standards ?
the other half was basically dry .
unbelievable .
his second choice is the chocolate chip coffee cake .
the first time , i thought it was a fluke .
two weekends in a row is a trend .
very disappointed .
it makes me wonder how clean the kitchen area really was .
service is terrible .
sad to say it has not .
dirty , not organized , bad & slow service .
come on people - this is not rocket science .
_num_ stars for the food ; _num_ star for the service .
last straw - only _num_ person behind counter removing bagels from the baking racks .
coming here is our weekend routine .
i was rushed and said `` plain ?
i get into my car and drive off .
plain cream cheese ?
that guy checked my bagel and lied to me !
however , do not lie to me .
if he 's lying to customers , what else is he lying about ?
not a good look my man .
my bagel is the easiest thing ever to remake .
i will not be returning here to any location .
it was like we were not even there .
iv had horrible service before this was beyond that .
wo n't be wasting my time here again .
terrible service .
very long line with only _num_ employees working at the moment .
i then picked up my phone and walked out , never to return again .
horrible experience !
( mistake number _num_ if anyone is counting ) .
no apology for the whole mess !
they could barely be bothered to talk on the phone .
horrible .
horrible .
i would give it _num_ star if not for the good service .
i would spend hundreds in chemicals that did nothing .
i turned to the internet to find answers to my problems .
stores ok , always have to wait for service .
people wait for a long time to check out .
zero stars .
should have been a quick , cheap job .
this place needs to be put out of business .
first of all , zero stars , but it 's not an option .
they do n't even deserve a single star .
the owner refused to replace , or even attempt to fix it .
do n't waste your time or money at this place .
not overly impressed .
major disappointment !
just went through the drive-thru and ordered my usual .
no lettuce , tomato , or mayo .
nothing like eating a dry sandwich .
prior to this experience i would have rated them overall as a _num_ .
i would skip this location .
egg was overcooked .
how the hell do people eat this .
it was disappointing because i was really hungry and had to throw everything away .
totally unacceptable .
i ordered a turkey sandwich meal with chips and diet coke no ice .
i got ta turkey sandwich or so i hope with a soda with ice .
the bacon on the turkey club was undercooked .
after tonight , i wo n't be back .
oh and the trash can was dirty .
the cashier was lazy and the only person working was the sandwich lady .
unless you get holly to cut your hair avoid this location at all cost .
the absolute worse haircut i 've had at this establishment .
the customer service is n't very friendly either .
you 've given yourselves a bad reputation .
it 's not some high fashion salon !
it 's a cheap hair cut place !
but this place looked like it had been hit by a plane .
no staff on the floor offering help .
one poor staff person was putting out artwork and avoiding all contact with customers .
some of the staff seem a little nicer than they used to be .
most of the store was dirty , disorganized , lacking price tags , etc .
store is really unorganized .
and when i tried to get help she told me just look through everything .
i just left lol .
a lot of clothes were on ground also never coming back !
they refuse to give them a refund to him .
i went there about two years ago .
kudos to a senior still running a store .
he quickly gave me a refund .
no apologies .
when you charge $ _num_ for delivery i 'd expect some level of professionalism .
would five _num_ stars if i could .
they were just going to keep my money .
arrangement delivered looked very different from picture online .
this is not how you should do business .
ps - it would n't let me post zero stars ...
i would give the safeway negative stars if it were an option .
bobby w the `` manager '' is extremely unprofessional , rude , and ignorant .
the man working was so cold .
the ingredients tasted expired , i could only manage to eat a couple bites .
wo n't be back to this part of the store .
i find it hard to locate what i am looking for .
so i am over it .
for the most part , i am satisfied with this safeway .
i could not do anything with my family .
shame on you bobby !
i do n't support places of business that treat their workers like $ hit .
shame on safeway .
i 'm only giving this a _num_ because the soup was good.
and , there were no packs of crackers by the soup up front .
the woman working was seriously rude .
made my sandwich completely wrong and super sloppy .
and she was just cranky .
terrible customer service .
hire someone with a better attitude .
worst deli department i 've ever been to .
nikki the women working behind the deli counter is just plain rude .
however , i 'm done with the arcadia store .
_num_ cashier open with _num_ carts lined up !
if i ever go back in that store , kill me .
Neutral
bring the damn atm back !
had the worst experience with safeway this week .
my car got broken into _num_ times over the _num_ years i lived there .
the owners are total jerks ... you can kiss your security deposit goodbye !
my car got broken into _num_ times over the _num_ years i lived there .
the owners are total jerks ... you can kiss your security deposit goodbye !
my car got broken into _num_ times over the _num_ years i lived there .
the owners are total jerks ... you can kiss your security deposit goodbye !
wrong !
there is also no follow up .
_num_ .
_num_ .
as a potential tenant , do n't waste your time .
his story would change constantly in between talking to my boyfriend and i separately .
_num_ days later , we still have n't heard a word back .
it was the first such bill i had received !
when she was ready , she took me into yet another room .
well that does n't help me get back to work on time .
she said she would call and then call me later that afternoon .
she was almost $ _num_ off ( not in my favor ) .
sorry dr. smith , you just lost a patient !
i made the situation very uncomfortable .
he 's not a honest person .
do not buy tickets from this company .
annoying , but , whatever .
it takes management several weeks to a month to finish or begin repair requests .
when it does finally get done , it 's sub-par .
several complaints have done no good .
people leave garbage around the complex , and the laundry room is terrible .
walls are very thin .
sorry , but i would recommend you go elsewhere to live .
this place is awful .
this should be no big deal , right ?
it has been _num_ months at this point .
i request to speak with the owner , and he refuses .
i ended up having to get my hands on some from someone else .
otherwise my poor cat would have went without .
my bill was just about all of the $ _num_ i had desperately saved .
they like to run expensive tests and we believe them to be dishonest .
and would not eat .
this was not needed .
i was told we charge you so you will bring the dog back .
inflated prices along with a rude vet .
no fee - no visit .
i 've decided to return to my old vet .
took my very first puppy to this vet and was n't very happy .
completely unnecessary .
so unnecessary , i hung up .
$ _num_ and a few free samples of treats .
this place is awful !
because i was loyal , i stayed .
the kitten was weak and in poor condition .
i was desperate for the life of this kitten so i did n't complain .
the testing was going through the roof and kept getting higher and higher .
she was over the top rude and seemingly snapped .
some concern ?
i declined the testing for that as it was expensive and unnecessary .
she strongly suggested blood work , which of course is nearly $ _num_ .
i spent $ _num_ for blood work .
she gave me some supplies so i could force feed the cat .
actually i would like to give them a big fat zero .
his dog died last night a horrible death that no animal should ever have .
i would give the hotel itself _num_ to _num_ .
horrible !
i have had far , far , far superior pedicures for $ _num_ .
do not get married here !
if you want a list of who actually used the valet , forget it .
my husband and i looked at each other wondering , huh ?
no one from management met me .
my biggest disappointment is that no one from the staff reached out .
unfortunately , i had a bad experience at tj cooks restaurant for lunch .
i ordered the flat iron steak and eggs .
except for the hash browns , the rest of the dish was inedible .
this was also disappointing .
this place is not living up to the hype .
y'all ca n't even spring for free parking for your patrons ?
spend your hard earned money some place else .
the problem lied in the staff .
management really does n't care what you think .
no way to tell what you might get .
but it was a mess .
and i 'm not talking like 2-3 ; it was more like _num_ .
and they did n't offer to take anything off the bill .
terrible customer service .
worst experience ever at `` _num_ star '' resort !
they have no respect for the working class !
so not a fun experience with the facial .
not okay !
overall i 'd say the whole spa experience really was not worth it .
very disappointed !
terrible service .
i would not recommend it and definitely not going back .
there was a girl walking around but she avoided me completely .
_num_ ) the parking garage looks like and smells like a dump .
a _num_ star hotel should keep up all areas where guest view .
they store old furnishings down there and there is a bad sewage smell .
_num_ ) they charge _num_ dollars to park your car .
sorry not enough in my book to bother with .
i have to say - we were not too impressed .
i must say , i was very disappointed .
also , a little too sweet for my taste .
just do n't understand what all the fuss is about .
so take my review or leave it .
not me .
i wish i could review it based on flavor , but i can not .
_num_ guests , catered lunch , no desserts .
either way , bad business model .
never , never , ever again .
the lady who helped her was rude , cold , and short .
as they should have done .
i 've been in this salon several times over the past couple of years .
the service at dinner time is bad , bad , bad .
poor management and only one waiter or waitress .
wo n't be returning for at least _num_ more years .
and that is probably only a maybe !
this place is disgusting .
the food order was wrong and it did not taste that great .
wait _num_ to _num_ minutes to get food ordered ... .
Positive
i hate to be the one negative review on here .
he paid $ _num_ for something that i could have done for $ _num_ .
i 'm disappointed in the quality of the arrangement .
i was not sure if north or south .
however , $ _num_ delivery charge ?
and it it way too loud to sit inside this place .
nice party trick but not good at a restaurant .
shame .
i know there are lots of different sandwiches here that you can try .
the bread is seriously the cheap kind you can get at the store .
it comes with a cookie which does n't taste like anything special .
really mediocre , just plain jane boring sandwiches .
just really not a very good place and not very good sandwiches .
i will never be coming back , there are much better alternatives .
what a disappointment .
someone in class suggested this place and it was such a let down .
unimpressed and disappointed .
there is nothing to these sandwiches .
there are so many other places to get better sandwiches .
will not be returning .
two thumbs down .
the hot sandwiches were luke warm .
the chip order was not delivered .
the drink order apparently was forgotten as well .
i have been going to sacks for _num_ years .
my interview process here was very impersonal and could have been completed by email .
indifferent counter help on their best days , downright surly on their bad days .
it 's to the point where we wo n't even go in there anymore .
i ca n't work at home because the bed always calls my name .
too sugary and strong spices .
i got a chai - it was weak and not flavorful at all .
not a lot of ambiance .
however , it should n't take _num_ days to get from az to ca .
i 've been dealing with this refund issue since the end of dec _num_ .
i think _num_ friggin months is long enough to wait for my money .
your company , and your customer service sucks big time .
there was not one other person in the relaxation room with me .
there also is n't a wall clock and i soon found out why .
my extra ten minutes pass .
obviously my massage therapist did n't show up until 9am .
sure the massage was decent ( not in price mind you ) .
by the way , the showers in the spa area are terrible .
do n't let the comments on here fool you .
no one in the club cares .
i was sadly disappointed .
i am an understanding person so i did n't really think much of it .
the thing that pushed me over the edge was the nail tech .
she rushed through and was extremely rude to me .
even the pool was a disappointment .
do n't get me wrong .
there are some people who are flat out awesome to chat with .
do n't waste your money at this poor excuse for a health club .
not so much anymore .
from what i hear the poor quality is specific to this club .
this place is unbelievable .
avoid this place like the plague .
unless your kids play tennis , do n't go here !
absolutely nothing to do for kids under _num_ .
boring !
basketball court is taken by adults .
very over priced for what you get in a family membership .
for the price of membership this club is not worth it .
very disappointing .
no other location seems to have this track record .
i wish they would upgrade their cardio room .
why are there security cameras in the men 's locker room shower area ?
Neutral
my studio reeks of cigarettes because they let residents smoke in their apartments .
thank god im one of the few that has not got bed bugs !
do n't bother moving here it 's a waste of time .
do n't waste your hard earned money in this place .
it was not a big deal until they stood us up .
no phone call or a notice to inform us .
it was not cool outside in june .
bad business !
there were no pets there but with her holding my cat i said nothing .
again , i said nothing because my cat was in her care .
however , i recently had a bad experience with this vet .
there was an emergency going on with another dog when i arrived .
she never called me back .
which is sad .
parking is a real problem .
and there seem be training issue going on at the coffee bar .
i have gotten several bad spanish lattes .
very disappointing .
ah , how i long for the good old days .
the prices here are n't exactly cheap .
i 'm not sure this place is worth the bother anymore .
it has a definite european touch .
it is just too darn small and busy .
there is no where to sit and no where to park .
for some reason now , the portions are smaller and not as good .
it 's a shame .
la grande orange grocery has a problem .
unfortunately , it ca n't be all of them .
unnecessary .
but i 'm afraid that i wo n't be back for the weekend chaos .
that 's _num_ separate occasions , i have stopped going here at all !
this place has more hype than actual delivery !
i was mediocre at best !
parking is insane as it has been for several years .
the breakfast i received was barely room temperature .
the food quality is just so-so .
which is too bad , because it 's right in my neighborhood .
wish i had more passion for the place ... .
the kitchen was rocking it , though .
if you do , you might want to skip it .
it was definitely longer than _num_ minutes .
she did n't think it would be a problem ... wrong answer !
what a shame !
my heart burn on this visit begins at the register .
two two items together totaled $ _num_ .
so , essentially , i paid $ _num_ for a pack of english muffins .
ridiculous !
two other women chose lgo for a business lunch last week .
the grocery area is where you order lunch .
it was shoulder to shoulder with other patrons , most professionally dressed .
i chose a caesar salad from the case as i was in line .
but it was sliced , lunch meat style turkey .
`` no thanks '' i told her .
the manager contacted me the day i went to lgo .
i find this in poor taste .
sorry , no .
i do n't get it .
i finally visited this place for lunch with some co workers .
first parking was a real issue and i hate having to valet my car .
i 'm so disappointed -- maybe we just ordered the wrong things ?
not much in the way of portion for the price you pay .
are you not paying your employees enough ?
it 's ridiculous .
i hate tip jars .
the first time i was there it was very crowded .
did not know that , being my first time .
i had a similar experience with snotty cashiers the 2nd time i went .
i wo n't be back .
this place is all hype .
the lines are long and the crowd totally pretentious and obnoxious !
mediocre at best .
it was disgusting .
the egg white omelet was flavorless crap !
i 've tried to like this place .
it 's been _num_ months .
trust me , this place is a joke .
the pizza sucks too btw !
but i recently heard that the kitchen workers wear no gloves when handling food !
the next problem i encountered was finding a place to eat my sandwich .
the wrong bread , and yep , they did it .
no big deal , as it moved quickly .
unfortunately by the time it got to the table everything was stone cold .
not the best experience , shame i really wanted to like the place .
breakfast however is entirely different .
they ca n't cook eggs !
really disappointed as i live only a block away .
seriously , who makes an awful cupcake ?
very disappointing .
i used to frequent this restaurant 2-3 times per week .
the passport ice tea is hit or miss .
why ca n't they brew the ice tea correctly ?
i will be asking for a free drink next time i am in .
the pizza was very very average , maybe they had an off night ?
the bad : service was horrible .
manager was rude .
the prices however are still way high .
there 's better ( and closer ) bakeries than this one .
completely disappointed .
not impressed at all .
took way too long to get my drink refills .
terrible .
impossible to park .
too many employees behind the main counter not doing anything .
not about a quality dining experience .
no thanks .
because , they just ca n't seem to get my drink right .
did n't even offer to remake it and she just walked away .
i 'm sorry but for $ _num_ a drink , get it right lgo .
i 'm giving this place a _num_ mostly because of the snotty service .
i said no thank you , and got the roll of the eyes .
also , the food is way over priced .
i wanted to like this place , but it 's super mediocre .
the atmosphere is very overwhelming .
not french in any way !
the sandwiches were mediocre ( yellow mustard , grocery store bread ? )
atmosphere was chaotic .
do n't waste your time .
my girlfriends and i decided to go out for dinner and drinks tonight .
shame on you !
cold coffee .
i even told the staff and they came back with more cold coffee .
so i normally like this place but something annoying happened today .
when i went to order it i was told that it was not vegan .
kind of annoying .
excuse me ?
uh , theres no bowl back there .
over on the other scale , it was less than _num_ .
this place was a mess .
things are hard to find here , their order makes no sense .
if i can help it , i wo n't come to this location again .
petco is probably my least favorite pet store to go to .
i do n't really see any reason to go here over the competitors .
i got my pet 's shots here and it was kind of a nightmare .
the only thing that makes this store good is the staff .
the biggest complaint of all is the smell !
and it has a horrible pet odor that made me sick to my stomach .
it smells like a pet store that is n't cleaned regularly .
will not be going again .
if you are a woman , be warned .
when she did see me , she began to ring me up .
... but no one ever came .
as does the dude standing there behind her ... in the red target shirt .
frustrated , as this has been done already .
of course , it 's target , so i still go back .
maybe i 'll get a t-shirt that reads `` i survived ghetto target '' .
supposedly the popcorn was on sale for $ _num_ .
yes , they do have sour patch flavored gum .
sure , in minimal amounts , but does that make it right ?
i will be taking my business elsewhere after my experience tonight .
why would you put products out on display that you ca n't sell ?
complete waste of money -- i am returning it .
Very negative
i would give this target negative stars if i could .
first , it 's disgusting .
today , my _num_ year old commented on how dirty it is .
the employees are rude .
my husband and i get starbucks , my son gets pizza , everyone wins .
the parking is terrible and very busy .
look out or you will get run over .
the breadsticks i got had no seasoning .
the coke was flat .
Neutral
wish i could give no stars , or negative stars .
target has been a staple in our house for years .
did n't learn and did n't look last week .
that is not ok !
sadly this does n't seem to be contained to bad management at one store .
if you do your grocery shopping at target , check the expiration dates .
for anything else , still not a bad place .
with my experience at target , it has been just okay .
also , it does not look good for the store or company at that .
there were plenty of tables and rest areas they could have sat in .
instead , they caused an inconvenience for a shopper .
i have been waiting _num_ minutes for a manager to find them .
do n't ever use this service .
plus 1/2 the time you go in there it seems like nobody works there .
then i asked him to explain the charges and he could n't .
i could not get an explanation of what i was being charged for .
i will never spend another dime in this store again .
they had a _num_ pack of all _num_ colors .
she did n't even bother with a top coat on my pedicure .
i also thought they had a poor color selection at this place .
i would n't come here again .
they charge too much according to her .
all in all i was n't too impressed .
Negative
if i could give this place negative stars , i would .
this place sucked .
the only positive note i have is they had the most recent us weekly .
i walk in and they get me in right away .
no , no no .
i do not want a flower .
now , this is where things take a turn for the worse .
so , they tell me it 's going to be $ _num_ .
whatever , i move on ... nothing i can do now .
she says `` no credit card , use atm in the corner . ''
so i realize they do n't take credit cards or checks .
drive down _num_ more feet for another salon .
i was promptly seated in a chair and then forgotten about for _num_ minutes .
i had to flag him back down and got a _num_ min manicure .
Neutral
i 'm sorry .
it was awful , _num_ min soaking _num_ for the pedicure .
i wish she would have said no when i came in the door .
will not go back here even if it was free !
they looked awful .
for a weekend , it was not packed at all .
i was rushed to the pedicure chair .
never again will i step foot in this shop .
i got the gel french manicure .
i did n't walk into there with a white spot on my nails .
now i have a very noticeable white spot on my new french manicure .
that is why i know her claim that it was my nail is incorrect !
unfortunately , my experience was everything but that !
the lady who did my pedi was terrible !
she will never get a tip from me nor ever do my feet again .
she completely ignored how i asked for my feet to be done .
it was such a rush job !
i 'm not even going to get started on my mani !
i 'm so livid , even writing this review .
they do n't even deserve the _num_ star that i just gave them .
just horrible !
_num_ minute wait for a rushed _num_ minute pedicure .
no massage , no attention to detail , no love , awful paint job .
overall a disappointing waste of money .
no joke he spit on the floor right next to the public water cooler .
went back in and i was treated terrible .
my nails look worse now than they did before .
continuing on ... so i had been wearing acrylic for about half a year .
you are going to tell me how much i weight .
wow how rude .
it is not my fault you are unhappy with your weight .
she ignored me .
she is mad at me for hurting me !
i have never had gel nails done so poorly .
$ _num_ is far more expensive than even the most skilled nail places .
just do n't go .
not worth your time or money !
i have never had this done before and i get very regular pedicures .
no lotion ?
no massage ?
he was confused about why he did n't get a massage .
the lady very quickly put on one coat of the polish i chose .
the polish i had been wearing before is still on my nails in places .
my feet looked so bad !
i have only ever done yelp reviews for good things .
i wish i could figure out how to post my picture .
it is truly sad .
looking for a place closer to home based on reviews gave it a try .
very disappointed , you just lost a new customer !
plus it is so noisy that it is hard to be heard .
like not real hipsters .
once again this was 7pm on a sunday .
the place- first , we asked to sit inside because it was slightly cold .
the food that i ate however was not any good .
i felt like they would never trust my judgement again .
however , making reservations there is a different story .
they only take reservations for _num_ or more .
they are old and tired .
food was ok bread was stale on my sandwich .
but service was not good at all !
god for bid you ask them to split a check .
i was told she can not do it .
it 's way too loud in here .
everybody raves about this place so i finally went with a friend last week .
service was awful .
wrong .
_num_ hours later , we got seated and ignored .
the bruschetta came out quickly but tasted stale .
so sad .
i thought , `` this is mediocre at best '' .
the service was ok , but again , pretty mediocre .
_num_ minutes pass and i see others that came in after me being seated .
_num_ minutes pass and i ask the hostess how much longer it would be .
the food an wine saved this from being a _num_ star in my book .
strike _num_ : it felt like it was _num_ degrees in there .
while everything was okay , i was n't knocked out of my socks .
i think the issue that they have is that it is not crispy enough .
all-in-all the place was n't bad .
crap .
food is mediocre .
this postino 's service does not and their bottles are n't cheap .
does n't the red wish to breath ?
it simply needs some good floor management .
the parking lot disaster strikes again !
no offer of another round of drinks , just here is your check .
the wines are ok but somewhat pretentious .
nothing worth writing about except the bruschetta .
salads are overpriced and no hot entrees ... unimpressive .
i just left literally _num_ seconds ago .
very disappointed .
lost a star because i do not like eating up .
lost a star because i do n't like eating in my living room .
why are restaurants now making their dining room a living room ?
not fond of high tops either .
lost a star because they opened the garage door .
they opened it and all of a sudden it was _num_ degrees .
not good , , too small ... n its overrated !
stuffy atmosphere .
mediocre bruschetta ( especially for the price ) .
the wine our waitress suggested was the only redeeming part of our experience .
we sat at end of bar due to _num_ min wait for table .
food was good but his behavior as a professional server was disappointing ... .
stopped by when they first opened and was n't very impressed .
we went for dinner based upon the reviews and was very disappointed .
her reaction was also very bothered and actually somewhat rude .
to much goat cheese and the bread ?
the food is below average and the service is atrocious .
however , i will never step foot in there or any postino property again .
if i could give this shack a zero star , i would .
i will not be back .
felt like going home and changing my chuck taylor 's to dress shoes .
im sorry but i think that is just flat out rude !
them to turn the fan off ... flat no response .
two people ordered bruschetta , french onion soup and different sandwiches .
the soup was ok ... not real hot but very salty .
the soup .
very inconsistent .
came to this location back in march and was very disappointed with the service .
that already left a bad taste in my mouth .
would not even check or anything .
will probably just stick to the tempe or central locations from now on .
about _num_ more minutes passed , and finally our food showed up .
would definitely avoid this place if you have any hopes of having quality service .
she said `` let us know how he 's doing . ''
a sentence that feels like a lie at this point .
but it did n't last .
once again the doctor would n't talk to me .
she was nice but could provide no information .
unacceptable !
she would not even touch my dog .
said her skin is disgusting and she smells .
very sad considering i have been a customer for 10+ years .
the veterinary assistants were very friendly .
the vets , however , can be really pushy .
so much that i would dread having to talk to them during every visit .
i told him no thanks .
there is one vet there who is n't a high pressure car salesman .
dr. rice was the only vet i liked .
no other vet did that .
he told me i should get some ear cleaning solution .
no thanks , banfield .
by this time i had spent around five hundred dollars .
really , i had spent a lot of money for nothing .
the staff aside from the actual vets are inept .
it 's hard to not be really annoyed with them at this point .
i made an appointment for him at banfield , just because it 's convenient .
i left feeling confident that my instructions would be followed .
)
the lines are ridiculous .
i only shopped here twice and both times the wait was just stupid .
very frustrating .
glad i do n't have to shop here again .
this is by far the worst frys i have ever been in .
this place is the dive bar of grocery stores .
when i walk through the front doors i just feel miserable .
sweat beads down my back .
what really turns me off is the clientele and it just feels ... dirty .
more than once i have been approached in the parking lot for spare change .
i shop here , only cuz it 's close & cheap .
why did n't u call me ?
horrible customer service .
`` may i have my money back ? ''
along the way i am `` greeted '' by kelly , the store manager .
why is there no cream ; why ca n't the clerk make refunds ?
by far the worst fry 's in the valley .
nothing worth a crap .
overpriced with no real selection .
this place is the worse .
the staff are rude and careless , and this place is very chaotic .
unfortunately i have to shop here regularly .
sure i can get it from safeway or someplace else but not here !
_num_ items for $ _num_ but you have to buy _num_ .
i don '' t want _num_ cases of soda .
why is almost all the 1/2 gallon ice cream no longer a 1/2 gallon ?
`` expired may _num_ , _num_ '' .
just a few months too old .
is the food bad ?
at this point , unfortunately , it does not get any better .
this was the highlight of the meal , which to me is sad .
sadly , our other entree was much worse .
the flavor was overwhelming and i could taste nothing other than lime .
nevertheless , had to try the mojito .
so-so and have had better .
also , the food looked and tasted like cafeteria food .
i came for lunch today and was very disappointed .
then the food comes and is wrong .
very wrong .
the rice is wet and salty .
too much cilantro all over the place .
this is not mexican is cuban .
yes we use cilantro on our food but not to that level .
rice should not be soup .
bad cooking period .
the most obvious reason for the _num_ star rating is the food .
it sucked shit .
it did not taste that it was freshly cooked in any way .
okay so last night _num_ of us came here for dinner .
couldnt get enough of it .
so disappointing .
our food was not good .
really disappointing .
other than that , there was nothing to really rave about .
this havana cafe location fell very short of our expectations .
we were greeted and shown to a table surrounded by plastic patio chairs .
tonight , once again we had just ok food and way over paid .
the food is barely average and super expensive .
they have definitely messed with the portions though .
the service - really pretty bad .
he gave both of us a really crappy vibe .
i almost feel like i 've lost a best friend .
poor mojitos ( which previously would knock my socks off ) .
many of us waiting have started to laugh at how horrible this guy is .
he even went as far as saying ya it 's over a _num_ min .
wait so i would n't wait if i were you .
pretty sad after i had given it a _num_ on my last trip .
i came home and actually brushed my teeth immediately , it was so bad !
quite frankly , it was way over priced .
and i 'm not talking about a few dollars too expensive .
for an average dinner , you 'll be spending $ _num_ to $ _num_ .
not bad , but for what you got , the price was outrageous .
due to poor service and overpriced entrees , they only get _num_ stars .
the whole time , we wished we had the other waiter .
i think i 'll try some place else for my cuban fix .
i invited my grandparents to meet me here for dinner back in march _num_ .
we started off with _num_ mojitos and some appetizers .
my bf was not impressed with his entree either .
over priced , plastic chairs and the food sucked !
so i had another chicken dish .
was n't horrible but nothing to come back for .
we waited forever for our check , forever to pay , etc .
my husband was so annoyed .
it was very ick to me .
she did not offer to bring me something else .
there was a distinct smell that was n't clean and was n't pleasant .
big mistake .
also you need to wash your hands before serving food after counting money .
for the appetizer , i ordered the beef empanadas .
for the entrees , i ordered the fried chicken and the paradise pulled pork .
the rice was as plain as jane .
the paradise pulled pork was mediocre , at best .
i 've had better tasting carnitas for half as much .
very uncomfortable and extremely tacky .
it was chicken with black beans and rice and a lime sauce .
any latin restaurant that uses minute rice is horrible .
but it does n't warrant my going back .
ago could change for the worse so quickly .
the food was tasteless , not authentic and way over priced .
awful !
food is awful , place smells .
would not recommend this place at all .
take that for what it is , i do n't eat much cuban food .
i obliged and let them know that water was just fine .
in this case , it did n't help the medicine go down .
it was that bad .
i did n't get a refill .
were basically losing their minds , running around , and super stressed .
that is why i feel like the food poisoning occurred from something truly awful .
third , the portions are small .
and fourth the service was poor .
i will not be back .
my cup of coffee was not even 1/2 way full .
it would take double the amount of food to satisfy me .
plantains was stiff as a rock and again no flavor .
just save your money .
anyway will definitely wo n't ever go back ... .
i really wanted to like this place , i really did .
unfortunately , our dinner just kept disappointing .
growing up in phoenix , i used to love havana cafe .
the black bean fritters were ... not what i remembered .
i was disappointed with my ( $ _num_ ) camarones havana .
i received no sides , and the plate was just bland .
what a disappointment !
minutes to be seated .
stopped by here on saturday night .
ever since the new owners bought it this place has gone to hell !
the food is frozen and not freshly cooked like it used to be .
we used to go here for $ _num_ breakfast every sat and sun morning .
so bad for business .
truly wish the previous owners would come back .
now this is n't pizzeria bianco where if you ignore me i will wait .
this place should be lucky anyone has walked in and kiss my feet .
service is terrible !
they are rude and do n't care about customers .
i do n't know how this place stays open for business .
he told me no , we no longer offer that .
no name tag on his shirt .
very bad customer service.
this same cashier _num_ weeks ago overcharged me by $ _num_ .
i asked for the correct change and he gave me $ _num_ more back .
i was so pissed at this point i just left .
i 'm calling the manager of this restaurant to complain about this man .
the manager should tell the man to change his ways or get fired .
_num_ mins later a different guy can to take my order .
i just got three rolled tacos with rice and beans for _num_ $ .
rang up to _num_ $ ?
rolled tacos were decent , ca n't really mess that up .
i wo n't be back .
when he did it really did n't seem like he was paying attention .
i walk back to my room and nothing on my order was correct .
i went back and returned it and asked for my money back .
guess i wo n't be supporting this business during my future trips !
tortilla was undercooked and barely any meat .
i 'm out _num_ ( for _num_ tacos ) and no dinner to eat .
i came in from out of town and hung out with my buddy joe .
it 's written like an advertisement .
the wings look nothing like they do in that picture .
ca n't wait to pass on this place for years to come !
ridiculous .
do n't know what the hype is about the wings .
although they are meaty , they have no real authentic flavor .
i ordered wings to go on january _num_ , _num_ and they were great !
looks do n't beat good service .
and by alcoholic i mean `` owner '' specifically .
needless to say , even at the correct weight they are overpriced !
they ruined _num_ new shirts and will not stand by their conditions of sale .
there were pipes and metal laying out by the front door .
they were rude and not sorry for the situation .
not my kind of place .
they just lost another item of expensive clothing and we 're done !
worst place ever !
the worst customer service experience in a long time .
long wait times while giving off lots of attitude while you wait .
this is ridiculous .
unacceptable .
thank you for wasting _num_ hours of my saturday .
customer service sucked .
not one person offered to help , and yes , it was slow .
the worst customer service and communication i 've ever experienced .
horrible !
i wo n't be returning , they need to work on their communication skills .
this is my final straw though .
paid a little over $ _num_ .
this is a terrible experience .
the owner ( wife ) , is extremely rude !
they ruined many items of clothes ( which would never take responsibility for ! )
terrible !
do n't bother with this place !
my _num_ year old and i were stunned !
we could n't believe what was happening .
i have also never been treated this way before .
she said she was not responsible and to take it back to the store .
she started yelling at my husband and me in front of another customer .
do not do business with these unethical people !
my clothes are just as dirty as when i dropped them off .
$ _num_ for _num_ dress shirts and a sport coat .
the second they said was washed at home and ruined !
i 'm sorry , but i was not that impressed with the food here .
i think i waited a whole _num_ minutes to get my food .
went for lunch and was very disappointed .
restaurant smells musty and the food was awful .
was it outrageously priced ?
would i eat here again if someone invited me ?
the sauce was kind of bland .
i guess i need to find another chinese take out place .
the weather was cold , so i wanted soup .
i ordered sizzling rice soup and some egg rolls .
i was disappointed with the quality of food .
the pork ribs were also just bland .
worst food ever !
the egg roll was great , but the sweet and sour chicken was horrible .
the sauce had no flavor and ruined my entire dish .
the food was n't very good .
i read the awesome reviews on this site , therefore my expectations were high .
our entire dinner was bland .
this was not .
the pot stickers were ok , but nothing special enough to write home about .
bland .
the kung pao chicken was the least amusing dish of all .
no flavor , no heat , and no veggies .
now , the cleanliness and presentation of the restaurant was in face phenomenal .
do you not realize that the elderly love buffets and bland food ?
fail .
was dry and the plum sauce accompanying it was watery .
my sweet and sour chicken , was tough and cold .
it was not worth the trip .
no veggies or meat , basically white rice .
two bites , toss .
slim and none .
this is definitely the low end of chinese food for phoenix .
first , i ordered wor wonton soup .
then came my chicken chow mein .
more bean sprouts than chicken and , again , needed so much salt .
it was the worst chinese food i have ever had .
my sauce was missing flavor as equally my veggies and beef were bland .
do n't eat here !
over all , i will not be going back .
but nothing else would bring me back .
the prices are too high , since the food was not good .
the beef was a tad overcooked and the broccoli was limp from being overcooked .
i was n't about to dig through the trash .
needless to say , they 've lost my business forever .
i used yelp to pick a restaurant to go to lunch with my mom .
i should 've paid closer attention to the bad reviews .
the dish that we had was void of flavor .
even adding a sh*t ton of spicy mustard could n't help save it .
the texture was off , almost rubbery .
i took one bite and was disappointed .
the kitchen is very poorly managed .
not really .
just know it will be a very long wait .
*the batter on the shrimp was not crisp and was not sauced or seasoned .
i would not recommend this dish to anyone .
so disappointed because of the great reviews given on check please az .
avoid this place at all costs .
my boyfriend went here for an allergy test .
two weeks later he gets a bill for $ _num_ !
stay away and for goodness sake , do n't take your children !
the worst customer service experience i have ever had .
they have no courtesy or manners what so ever .
find another doctor .
i am really dissatisfied with the place .
update : i had another appointment with the doctor today at _num_ .
she saw my til _num_ .
at _num_ i went to the front and told them i had to leave .
my thought : then you better schedule like she takes a while .
i went with _num_ other friends .
there were _num_ meatballs for $ _num_ .
i told her , then i did n't want the fish and chips .
we had a hamburger it was a little dry .
it was time to stop by for a casual dinner .
this dish was an embarrassment to salads .
it is not memorable and there are too many other food places close by .
unfortunately our lunch was only fair .
our waiter was so-so .
this review is about rude , rude wally .
the food was ok , frankly not one thing to talk about .
a $ _num_ - $ _num_ burgers and salad kind of joint .
i told wally i thought that was too expensive for a restaurant like his .
well , wally , no way am i stepping back in yours .
she never even asked if i was finished .
i personally was not thrilled about that .
i was never warned that they heat their dip up so hot .
i burned myself so bad that my mouth was peeling and bleeding .
totally rude , offensive and bad customer service with a reply like that .
it seriously was not a lot of drinks to keep track of either .
the only other time i saw the bartender was when my glass was empty .
so i paid requested my bill and went somewhere else to eat .
just spent $ _num_ for cold wings and two beers .
if i wanted leftovers i would have stayed home for free !
maybe today was just not a great day for them .
the motto must be : `` the customer is always worth insulting . ''
needless to say this ruined the meal experience completely .
our server was not very friendly .
gary ate a few of his after he drowned them in ketchup .
tables that were sat when we finished eating had already finished their food .
i just left a sad tip .
he has spent a lot of time being a chef and serving tables .
so now on to my second dining adventure and i am still not impressed .
so now the omelet is $ _num_ ridiculous .
went a couple times too , just to be sure .
barely got greeted , then long waits between waitress visits before she disappeared completely .
ridiculous .
i will not be returning , _num_ strikes taylor 's you 're out .
the huevos rancheros sucked .
very bland , nothing great at all .
so we drove to ihop ... which was packed .
it was like $ _num_ for the _num_ of us !
for like $ _num_ ?
$ _num_ for oj ?
literally one of the worst dining experiences ever .
this place is truly a joke , i will never go back .
i wish i would have waited in line .
secondly , it was severely undercooked and runny in the middle .
there were several less than pleasant surprises .
my daughter 's eggs came out almost within seconds .
shocked , i saw it was n't just eggs , but hashbrowns and fruit .
it was also not warm .
that surprise was a $ _num_ meal .
while waiting for our meal , i drank most of my coffee .
my eggs benedict was not warm ... again !
we will not go back .
this was just one disappointment after another .
thank you for that waste of time .
ask me to hand it to you , do n't reach across !
i ordered a veggie burrito with a side of fruit and some salsa .
never in my life have i been served something like that .
it is were possible to give this restaurant zero stars , i would .
i can not tolerate such poor service and will not return .
trust me , you can find a better breakfast or lunch place .
the table was very small with seats that will make you uncomfortable .
eggs benedict with spinach , bacon , tomato and avocado .
the plate was cold and the eggs were luke warm .
not cooked at all !
no bueno .
costco referred me to this place .
would you believe $ _num_ !
i lost the screw in my glasses .
the owner was friendly , the service was prompt and fairly priced .
a big mistake .
this guy totally bait and switched me .
i went back in and said ok i will do it .
he refused .
they sent me to the frame doctor .
he said he was sorry ; but he could not do that .
however , if they break again , he will repair them for free .
for $ _num_ i would have expected more .
maybe this shop is better at shoe repair than leather repair .
disappointed overall .
worst .
no ... scratch that , i must vent .
wow , what a disaster .
( wrong ! )
first of all , cash only , people , no plastic .
egg rolls ( small , cut in half , and awful .
yep , that 's it .
and no refills on the sodas , either .
some greasy chinese crispy noodles .
no soup .
( hey , no soup means not having to provide spoons ! )
maybe it was better back then , i do n't really know .
the booths are also extremely uncomfortable and the restaurant is tiny and crammed .
bottom line , they should have just let this buffet chain die .
the place is a rat hole !
a little over $ _num_ total with tax and drink .
one long tray of fried chicken ... .
only one thing missing .
why bother eating fried chicken if you ca n't have it with ketchup ?
no refill in drinks except ice tea .
i gave two stars because the fried chicken actually tasted good .
tasteless does n't begin to describe that dish !
how in the world does golden coin prepare that stuff ?
it 's awful .
i 'm dropping stars because it seems impossible to get a refill on soda .
so far it 's been fifteen minutes and i thirsty as heck .
kid 's under the age of four eat for $ _num_ .
it was surprisingly busy .
so , why was it so busy ?
more veggie selections than meat , which can be good for some folks .
it has n't and that is not necessarily a bad thing , per se .
will i get sick this time or not ?
she actually never said `` hello '' and never smiled .
ca n't say this was a good experience and i wo n't be back .
i expected better quality of service during my visit but was very disappointed .
you never see a dermatologist ... only a pa .
unbelievable .
i would highly recommend staying away from this place .
i go in , and was told to stop taking the med .
google it , it 's pretty nasty .
i met the doctor for only _num_ minutes .
this was the first frustrating issue .
this office is very incompetent .
unfortunately , her employees have the worst bedside manner i 've ever dealt with .
it was horrible .
however , i know that it was .
i arrived this morning _num_ minutes early to fill out paperwork .
the pa left and said she 'd see what she could do .
( none of them were `` cheap . '' )
i use to cry myself to sleep every night .
they would n't tell me .
this time it was extremely frustrating .
the office staff is incompetent in my experience .
you can never get through to scheduling .
not impressed for all the good reviews .
my wait turned into _num_ minutes and no one said a word to me .
my acrylics tho was a totally different story .
i do n't understand why some people speak so highly of this place !
terrible terrible job .
very rude man by the way .
no just no !
never ever going back , i do n't care how cheap they are .
she 's lucky she got a _num_ $ tip .
my friend also had a bad experience & she did n't even tip .
this place just refused service .
they made me wait _num_ minutes and then refused service .
i will not be coming back !
they said $ _num_ more than the place i usually go to .
there work has got so poor !
all those girl are now gone and the people now just suck .
especially this dude they hired .
over priced for the less then mediocre work .
horrible service !
also it 's not very clean .
all around horrible .
most horrible nail salon ever .
also the salon was hot as shit .
i am new to the area and i wanted a dive bar night .
it is not as divey as the previous reviews in my opinion .
these qualities are opposite of a dive bar .
it seemed to me that the customers were all regulars .
not so much .
another pretentious take over .
i will not use fresh cut romance in the future .
every bar has a different appeal , but bad service ruins it for me .
do not ever step into this establishment if you are not a white conservative .
horrible .
if there were less than one star then i could be more accurate .
i 've never been treated worse by a bartender .
trashy bar .
came in with some coworkers to shoot pool at the end of the night .
but to get yelled at like that was crazy .
i would rather shoot pool at river city pockets .
this will never be the dilly again .
i wish this establishment well but you missed the mark with people like me .
if it was n't broke , why in the world would you fix it ?
she 's in a lot of pain now and her days are limited .
we schedule new patients _num_ weeks out '' & hung up .
no exceptions ?
my dog does n't have _num_ weeks left .
very rude .
not a good first impression .
not the dunkin donuts that everyone remembers .
not the best run dunkin ' donuts .
after hearing all the hype , the commercials on tv , etc ... .
their donuts were dry , my local donuts shop have way better donuts .
i like dunkin ' but the service sucks .
the cashier was rude but i would be too if i had that job .
so i went to this place a few times .
the donuts are ok , they are donuts nothing special .
apparently the people who made my iced coffee drinks did n't know that .
not just once , or twice , but three times .
mcdonalds has better coffee .
qt gas stations have better coffee .
people are nice , but their iced coffee making skills are horrible .
el pollo loco is overpriced food with very small proportions .
not worth it .
our chicken was so over cooked we could not eat most of it .
our enchiladas were stone cold .
i was shocked , my dad would not eat any of it .
the manager came out and rudely said it would be _num_ more .
i was n't asking for a side dish , just a simple substitute .
fail .
ordered _num_ chicken breast and drum stick .
got home _num_ chicken breast and drum stick .
not the first time they have done this to me which makes me .
chips were stale .
wo n't be returning to this location in the future .
and of course my order was wrong since she was n't paying attention .
sorry pollo , you are off my lunch list !
the worst part about this is that they are n't even busy .
very disappointing .
they will forget ur utensils and ignore u when asked .
it 's _num_ ' inside .
i mean , really ?
horrible service hot as hell inside and everything was dirty .
needless to say my husband and i will not be returning to this location .
how the hell do u not have chicken a _num_ minute wait ?
it was ok , but i was not a fan of the presentation .
for my entree i had the veal parm , and it was sub-par .
it felt like a chicken fried steak .
the bill for two came to approx $ _num_ .
we started our meals with salads .
my entree was equally as disappointing .
unfortunately , this time that was not the case .
she soon regretted her choice as much as i regretted my lasagna .
i had chosen it because it was not tomato sauce or cream based .
i guessed it was the standard dish , but boy was i wrong .
to start with , service was far too leisurely .
escargot - they tasted fine but they just seemed old-fashioned .
tried this restaurant this past friday for the first time .
not enough herbs to really flavor it .
we asked for more bread and they did n't seem happy .
no side dishes come with it .
it was just ok.
nothing special .
my husband hated his .
flavorless .
not the best and a little vinegary .
and i do n't need a coupon to eat there .
do n't use coupon !
you ate looked down upon and treated poorly .
waiters are not pleasant , choices are spaghetti dishes and chicken dishes without spaghetti !
skip this place .
there are much better italian restaurants in phoenix .
ok quick tip food service industry .
they hired servers once and they have all been working there since .
not that they were not kind , or attentive .
those parts were there , just a very old school approach .
as far as the food goes , nothing was that impressive either .
also , they did n't clean the shrimp .
worst italian food ever .
rude waiter .
i do n't know where to start .
this place is way past its prime .
this place has the worst service .
do n't expect your server to be pleasant at all .
they look like they just hate serving people and that it 's a bother .
i requested another round of bread and that was almost _num_ minutes ago .
the prices here are an absolute joke .
i took some old navy shorts in for my _num_ year old son .
her price is $ _num_ !
this place is a complete joke .
it was a waste of time .
it 's just a damn fitting and none of your business .
such a waste of time .
if you are going here you are getting robbed .
just awful awful customer service and communication with customers !
if i could i would give this place no stars .
my cousin called and talked to the receptionist asking for a quote .
$ _num_ it came out to !
i was in school when she went so unfortunately i could n't go .
she was busy so she called me a few hours later .
i find that to be quite rude .
so i asked why was it $ _num_ for something so small ?
she also told me that she gave my grandma a deal .
after the situation over the phone my grandma picked up the dress .
seriously my experience with this place was awful .
the guys serving was very friendly yet slow .
every time i 've been here , there is a problem .
told you , lots of excuses and false promises .
i do n't even trust they completed the services they signed off on .
on the whole a really lousy job .
left no tip and would certainly not recommend .
quite possibly the worst experience of my life .
they also have a nice punch card system .
they will tell you need a transmission flush .
complete and utter rip off !
i called discount tire and they fixed it for free .
dont know why i came back to this location a second time !
horrible customer service and terribly rude over the phone .
so , i went to a different store where they were awesome .
this place is awful !
i 've been going to firestone for yrs all over arizona .
i 've been here a total of _num_ times this week !
refused to top off all my fluids .
when asking for my keys back , he refused .
made an account just so i could post this review .
this is pretty standard for this industry and did n't bother me .
i wish i could give zero stars !
i told them when i needed it by , and they said no problem .
$ _num_ later , i have my laundry .
lazy and unprofessional .
when i got home and realized what had happened , i called to inquire .
and then hung up on me .
i would absolutely never come back here .
lazy lazy lazy .
owner is a liar and does n't care about doing things right .
i strongly advise to stay away from this place .
i immediately say , `` this is not our comforter . ''
what made all of this even worse was the owner was a total jerk .
it cost me $ _num_ and a lot of time and energy .
shame on arcadia cleaners !
there was absolutely nothing wrong with the house .
it sat as it always does with nothing to set off the alarm .
so , i could be in this for a few hundred dollars .
no extra cost for hardware .
lots of promises but no other options given .
this is not the way an honest company does honest business .
your food is bland and nasty .
the meat was not good at all , it tasted sour .
the buns were really mushy .
well , the chili was disgusting .
in all my life i have never had chili like the chicago hamburger co .
so so sweet ... so un edible .
really thin though and the batter they use is n't very special at all .
they have a turkey burger which sounds good .
sorry chicago hamburger co i really really wanted to like you .
would not go again since i think there are better places out here .
the burger was awful ; it had no flavor whatsoever .
the hot dog was better than the burger , but it was just average .
the burger and fries are nothing special ... .
be prepared for patties cooked in old grease .
burgers are soggy and the fries taste like they are cooked in old oil .
place is kind of dirty and parking is a nightmare .
nothing special here , especially for the price .
$ _num_ lunch for a burger , fries and a drink .
also the dining room is pretty much standing room only for lunch .
no thanks .
does n't look clean .
the food was great , the customer service was horrible !
i wo n't be back .
the walls are covered with anything and everything chicago , obviously .
did n't taste any better than mcdonald 's , to be honest .
i would not go back for the sliders or beef items .
chili - there was sugar in the recipe .
i did not like .
nothing like white castle .
i really doubt the meat is old due to the restaurant is quite busy .
it is not a dirty odor .
i am sitting in the restaurant writing this review .
i 've passed this place several times and the parking lot is usually full .
i figure with _num_ starts on yelp , it might be worth a try .
maybe i should have tried the sliders .
but what really killed this was the bacon that was as tough as jerky .
i feel like i 've been cheated out of `` cheat calories '' .
fast forward to arizona .
no frills , just hopefully , the taste you came to enjoy .
good idea , but way too heavy .
for all the great toppings , that chicago style dog was a bust .
i ate it , but the experience was disappointing .
sad sad example of sliders .
i was excited to try out this place but it is just not good .
pretty affordable and service is alright but still not worthwhile to give another shot .
so there is no reason to offer a sub par product .
staff was not friendly .
disgusting .
sad because the burgers were quite good , sliders were so-so .
too dirty and unorganized for my taste ; bathroom really filthy .
horrible customer service , would not go back .
however , my first experience with them will also be my last .
when i got to the store , the price was n't marked .
wo n't go there again , no matter how good the staff is .
miss the old owners .
kids do n't count .
just lost my business .
last week i purchased _num_ `` raspberry fuzzy '' plants .
_num_ days later they are dead .
one woman looked at them and said i killed them and walked away .
again , baker nursery , you have lost my business .
you have _num_ % lost my family 's business !
so much for trying to support local businesses .
my fianc was so shocked he was n't sure how to respond .
i am utterly disappointed and will never go back again !
one was marked $ _num_ and one was $ _num_ .
this is just terrible customer service !
i spent alot of money here , and they do n't care .
i told him , my lemon tree was struggling .
no mango with rice because they were out of season .
i would n't rush out to this place .
Neutral
too bad i can not give this place a _num_ or negative star review .
thai curry has the peanut sauce and curry base .
do n't tell me they were all in the back cooking either .
its like walking into a mexican restaurant and all the wait staff were chinese .
i came in for lunch and the menu was expansive !
i think it was thai bbq chicken with spicy sauce .
i figured , i ca n't go wrong with that .
not traditional thai but i could n't make up my mind about the others .
i was n't sure if they ran out of thai bbq or chicken .
apparently its bbq so i settled for the sesame chicken .
bad idea .
this place is the equivalent of salt lick thai .
i have been here _num_ times .
the green curry was a lumpy , floating in grease mess .
the red was equally as greasy and neither had coconut milk in them ?
i ca n't believe this place is still in business .
i went to this place off of word of mouth for goo thai food .
they brought me a rice dish .
tonight was the night .
what a nasty first impression to give out to people .
did n't think it would be a big deal .
i must have made them uncomfortable reading the new times while i was eating .
what a disaster !
maybe it is hard to get fresh basil in the desert ?
so instead i had some yellow curry with potatoes and chicken .
nothing special .
the rest of our meal was just mediocre as well .
that is a big fail right there !
she , unfortunately , spoke very little english .
we made our order , beginning with chicken satay .
the vegetable curry was unlike any curry i 've ever seen .
the only thing good is the price .
certainly not the food and definitely not the service .
the service was nothing to write home about but it wasnt awful .
the second time i came with my husband , the service was deplorable .
she then left for _num_ minutes when someone from the kitchen staff came out .
i have tried this place _num_ times .
the food is not very good .
the food is bland , overcooked and pretty americanized .
i ordered chicken pad thai and wanted to replace the shrimp with veggies .
the staff has no knowledge of the menu without ordering by numbers .
chicken satay was ok , but the peanut sauce was runny and gross .
i decided to go there and place my order .
waited _num_ minutes to be seated .
then waited another ten minutes before leaving .
Neutral
very dated decor is another negative .
even tho it was ok i will not be returning .
worst thai we 've ever had .
greasy , gross , packaged mix flavors .
gross .
very greasy and tasted like the sauce was made from a packaged mix .
i took one bite and did n't eat any more .
chicken satay was underwhelming .
we had fried rice was good avoid pork however the shrimp were pretty good .
if you go , expect long wait times for basic curry and rice .
if you order take out , expect even longer wait times .
there was no apology .
you wo n't be disappointed .
there just is n't .
as a result , we 're stuck with this place .
it was a monday night , somewhat busy .
the server took another tables appetizers and drink order before asking me anything .
worst thai food i 've ever had in my life .
the service was great but the food was average at best .
the chicken was gross and the curry was runny and not very flavorful .
the rice was soggy .
everytime i try to go to this restaurant they are always closed .
the service was terrible .
i did n't see one smile from either server .
my pad thai was delivered without the peanuts .
she made me fork thru the dish to make sure there were no peanuts .
the shrimp was cook well , but the chicken was dry and tough .
i have n't written many reviews , but the experience was so lame .
i wo n't be back and would not recommend this place to anyone .
but to be clear this place is not for a pad thai lover .
ordered eggplant and green curry with chicken .
eggplant wasnt even near cooked and tasted like leather .
i know people have their off days but this was waaaay off .
i do not recommend this place if you like thai food .
too many other spots to get your fix .
i would n't give a _num_ unless i got sick .
the waitress & the cook were extremely rude !
i walked out and wo n't be back again .
i had the beef rad na , which was sub par .
all in all , the ingredients and the noodles in the dish tasted cheap .
the thai iced tea was overly sweet and even the fortune cookies where cheap .
i only wish i did .
rude !
worst place ever !
food was gross !
life is too short to eat bad thai food !
everything was over cooked and mushy .
extremely disappointing !
i ordered a simple green curry and it was so runny and bland .
the veggies were not cooked still raw .
not worth it at all .
do n't waste your time here .
i purchased my bed at this location just over _num_ year ago .
one year later and i 'm ordering a new bed from someplace else .
this is the worst mattress i 've ever slept on .
worst customer service experience ever !
they were n't helpful at all .
in fact , they were actually quite rude .
they refused to take the bed back .
i did n't even have it for _num_ hours .
( that 's why i called _num_ times . )
in other words , throw the follow-up request in the trash !
no , i said , i do n't want that .
they lied .
clearly , they want to get a bed sold , period .
i would not recomend this shop .
dishonest ... pricing is horrible .
keep _num_ hand on your money if you deal with this sleazy company .
i agree with the _num_ star rating .
nothing is written as return policy .
never ever going back .
can not recommend .
horrible customer service and terrible return policy .
Very negative
walked around , nobody came in .
not really my job as the customer to go looking for a warm body .
this place was a total waste of my limited time .
rude staff !
then on the scheduled pick-up time , post event , they were also late .
i would not recommend this company .
they were unable to work with me and could not offer a solution .
customer service is not a priority at this business .
do n't waste your time here .
i rented a rotisserie and grill here for a large party i was having .
he just cut me off and said he couldnt do anything without numbers .
we had several problems with equipment that we recently rented .
instructions were wrong and some of the parts were missing .
she did not get that .
the most ridiculous thing i 've ever heard .
it 's just started to get ridiculous .
i do n't expect perfection but my dogs deserve better than this .
it pains me to write this review .
but , i must yelp the truth .
( understand that i 've made all of that up in my head . )
but , no .
someone else had picked up my clothes .
but , i kept going back because i just love the owner .
but , i ca n't .
so disappointed .
the dr. never returned my call .
only one person stuck their head in to say she was running late .
unfortunately , the quality of the staff has been going downhill in recent years .
i would give them a zero if i could .
Negative
i had no negative experiences with this clinics until today .
i 'm so mad .
more than _num_ minutes later !
i will never see that horrible woman again .
i am so sorry i did .
this kfc is horrible !
( i know , kinda weird ) .
every kfc i go to has such a problem with this , its unbelievable .
i ordered the _num_ piece boneless chicken breast meal .
the only thing that was good was the mashed potatoes and gravy .
we paid $ _num_ for one of the worst meals ever .
i will never go back to this kfc again .
i will not be going to this kfc ever again .
i am just tired of awful food at these chains .
there was very little meat and what there was was slimy and undercooked .
this place is trash .
there is _num_ people inside waiting for their food for over _num_ mins .
all the employees look like they are on drugs and not caring about anything .
pathetic .
my 2nd experience with this restaurant yesterday was not positive !
bad idea !
my sister , daughter & i were _num_ minutes early to the restaurant .
there would be _num_ of us and he would not hear of it !
sorry new owner ... you missed out on our patronage yesterday and forever !
)
my husband got the chili relleno and i got the cheese enchiladas .
surprisingly the server was very quick with the bill .
i tried to talk my husband into not tipping but he is a gentleman .
)
greasy , flavorless and unappealing .
but the food was horrible .
save your money , t bell is an upgrade compared to this joint .
the owner was so rude i walked out !
this is the worst service i have ever experienced in my entire life .
i get to the restaurant for the first time this week .
i have never been treated like that before in my life .
the food here is mediocre at best .
i went after reading all the above positive reviews and was really disappointed .
this visit turned us off , and we will not likely return .
it 's actually the customer service that gets _num_ star .
the owner is rude along with the waitresses .
the food is mediocre or less .
they do n't tell you that it is a cash only business .
it is cold outside but they do not have a heater inside .
i will not be returning to this establishment .
boy was i wrong .
i ordered a margarita , and it literally was _num_ % crushed ice .
it was horrible !
i had the nasty aftertaste in my mouth all weekend .
not when you leave a place with a stomach ache and an empty wallet .
oh and on that note , they only take cash also .
pain in the butt for someone who only carries a card .
you know my cheap self is n't paying an atm fee .
there are way to many mexican restaurants to have such a lack of flavor .
they were hot but the meat tasted old so he just ate the outside .
they only accept cash be warned .
this year _num_ it 's $ _num_ .
about a yr or so ago , i stopped going to him .
i rarely go to the doctor and visiting this practice reminded me why .
she was down right rude !
if i were you , i would pass on this facility .
our dr. is great but the administration fee is completely inappropriate .
this is total bs .
the doctors are good there , but it is soooo slow .
is n't this the cost of doing business ?
this , unfortunately , is not one of them .
insurance companies do not pay the fee .
this place just has terrible customer service .
monday is a holiday and i am in pain .
no help offered whatsoever by the person taking appointments .
she just was n't pleasant at all and i would never see her again .
the problem does not rest with him , as he recently joined this group .
the phones are always busy if you wish to not talk at a machine .
once she left , i should have too .
then they decide to charge me the annual patient fee !
very upset that the practice charges a ridiculous fee .
this place is garbage and their doctors are garbage too .
he just shook his head and said he did n't know why .
chris responded `` we are big _num_ , what is customer service ?
first thing i noticed : did not smell good when i walked in .
second , staff was not very welcoming to new guests .
fifth , no one talked to each other ... awkward .
the problem with this studio is the woman at the front desk .
she continued to challenge me and i was ready to walk out .
do n't go here !
the dentist was seriously the biggest idiot i have ever talked to .
i could not believe he had actually somehow gotten to that position .
i went in for the cheap breakfast for the first time at noon today .
anyhow the eggs and bacon came with that , they were cooked okay .
this place is nasty dog .
this used to be our favorite breakfast place .
now the food is hit or miss and service is very spotty .
sometimes they 're really slow , sometimes they just get the order all wrong .
horrible experience .
i 'm really disappointed .
the food is bomb .
horrible parking and service , staff ignored us as soon as we walked in .
from the views , multiple tables waiting for their orders to be taken .
bad service .
never had this issue .
)
i was n't asking for anything for free .
three , nothing .
so i made them give me my money back this morning .
the prices were ok but not as aggressive as they used to be .
the service was n't very good either granted it is a furniture store though .
it has to have _num_ inches of wear down on the sides !
will not shop there again !
then i scheduled a technician to come out and fix it .
worst customer service ever .
good prices but bad service .
later on thursday early evening i had not received a call .
i had requested a saturday morning delivery online .
on saturday morning i had not received a call .
hello , the customer should not have to work so hard !
they lost another customer .
i purchased a $ _num_ sectional from them .
they refused to fix it stating that it was outside of the year .
i will never give these rude unprofessional liars any of my money again .
i wish i could just return the thing and go some where better .
no customer service !
here it is february and they claim to know nothing .
these people are uninterested in helping once they have your money .
the customer service manager pam is the worst woman i 've ever spoken too .
she ignored me .
flat out ignored .
so we wandered up there on our own .
s : oh , we work in rooms .
h : ok , so you ca n't help me then ?
and he walked away .
so - we walked out .
and i wo n't be back .
however , trying to flag down a salesman is another story .
needless to say we went elsewhere .
i would suggest really giving the furniture a once over before they leave .
poor customer service , in my opinion .
they said no and suggested i cancel my order .
i do n't know where i come from the customer is always right .
i should 've cancelled my order there .
huge , old , smelly and rude finance people ( jessica ) .
they holding my money for a week .
if i did n't call and ask , they would hold for a month .
the phoenix showroom is full of a bunch of unhelpful jerks .
i called the phoenix showroom back , thinking that they could offer help .
boy , was i wrong .
skip the phoenix showroom if at all possible !
but from the moment they had my money - everything went down hill .
on the morning of the delivery , i called for my window .
they informed me that the sofa would be delivered promptly at _num_ .
not earlier , not later .
i was unimpressed by this lazy and rude customer service .
this place is not what it used to be .
not for me .
it was supposed to be delivered in a week .
learn from my mistake .
fell in love with a set and bought it immediately .
that 's over _num_ more weeks with no couch .
i am irritated and this was a _num_ % different experience than years ago .
this will not be a stop for furniture ever again !
very disappointing !
after you 've purchased , though , forget about it .
seriously , no one cares about you here .
extremely disappointed in the business .
i gave him the item description and the stock # .
after waiting _num_ minutes ( with no call back ) i tried again .
i was transferred again to have someone check on the item .
now i 'm confused since i was just told they had _num_ in stock .
i spoke with pam and i explained the situation .
she also checked the stock number and confirmed that had _num_ in inventory .
then my phone rings and it 's the previous man calling back ... again .
one maintenance man to handle _num_ apartments i think is unreasonable !
do n't even bother unless you need the area for convenience !
safety is not their concern !
they should be ashamed calling this a gated community i do n't feel safe !
it 's nightmare management !
rent will be $ _num_ in winter $ _num_ in summer .
the service is just ok - they are far from friendly .
i wanted to give them another chance tonight and i should not have bothered .
the food is not so good .
the spring rolls are greasy and room temperature and the tofu is pretty nasty .
pei wei , you give pad thai a bad name .
so bland .
so so bland .
and the crab rangoon was nothing to write home about either .
no joke , i was probably there twice a week .
however , about _num_ months ago , they did something awful .
big mistake .
i was too annoyed to care .
the chicken was dry and chewy .
i just do n't get the draw .
it was too salty and lacking in other flavors .
however , i 'm not tempted to try it again .
i go to pei wei for the spring rolls and the chicken lettuce wraps .
gross !
we also ordered the steak lettuce wrap which was gross too .
thanks for the disgusting food .
but on an individual dinner basis i have been disappointed .
until tonight , i experienced the worst service at the phoenix location .
your service sucks and i never should had paid full price for my meal .
food poisoning - april _num_ , _num_ .
( sesame instead of honey seared . )
orange chicken w/ fried rice was n't to my expectations .
omg !
used to go here quite a bit but it 's been a few years .
stopped in for dinner about 8pm tonight .
these containers obviously do n't get washed .
on the way back from the bathroom i looked into the kitchen .
i 've never seen a kitchen so bad .
the food was more disgusting than the restaurant .
a complete disaster !
today ; wtf pei wei ?
wrong !
unprofessional , sloppy , and rude .
none of us will be back .
i guess the customer service took away my hunger .
the rice is dry .
it 's too bad .
the restaurant would n't honor the coupon .
now for the worst part ... .
did not even feel me up !
not chinese food .
it 's called little shanghai .
she says oh well pants cost $ _num_ to be pressed .
however , i wo n't be going back .
i do not recommend this place .
alexander then hung up on me .
i checked under the hood to see if anything was touched .
low and behold not a single thing had been touched .
he did n't install a new anything .
i will never return to alexander 's auto .
$ _num_ for the small blizzard .
guess i wo n't be getting one of those again for a while .
worst service !
ordered a hot fudge banana shake and instead got a sunday .
this location is convenient and that is why i gave it _num_ star .
honestly every time i go here my order is wrong .
i ordered a cheeseburger and fries , and they microwaved a burger for me .
they really ca n't go wrong with getting a blizzard , thank god .
i love dairy queen , but this location is awful .
these guys are n't experts .
that was absolute bs .
i checked my watch to make sure it was n't april 1st .
they 're rude .
they 're pretentious .
worst bike shop ever !
not $ _num_ total !
avoid bike barn at all costs !
chuck and ryan , rude , chuck dropped my bike off the rack .
never going back .
no one said anything to me in the first _num_ shops .
that seems to be typical of bike shops in phoenix .
if you are n't in the club they do n't have time for you .
unfortunately bike barn is a typical phoenix shop .
do n't know what , the store was empty .
i wo n't be back .
i had been going to this shop for years , but i 'm done .
then i come home and fix it myself in _num_ min !
i have n't had any experiences with mary , whom everyone seems to love .
i 'm sure i 'm not the only one .
definitely a mixed review for me .
happily they called _num_ days later .
friendly but dishonest staff .
i will not be returning to bike barn for any future purchases .
they simply are not trustworthy .
my bike does n't fit in my car and i live fairly close by .
honestly i was frustrated .
i was just really disappointed .
it was $ _num_ .
i understand things are more expensive in stores but that seems a little steep .
ugh , these guys are such crooks .
big mistake .
no apology .
as an act of goodwill bike barn offered to fix the problem for free .
they seriously give the bike community a bad , shady name .
to say that they had poor customer service would be an understatement .
frustrated i let him know i would be there at that time .
no matter , i was especially excited to have my watch back .
the crystal was still cracked .
after all that , nothing had been done .
i am completely speechless , grab the watch , and head for the door .
what a complete waste of time .
i went here bc of yelp reviews and i realized i have been fooled .
first off , he rudely snapped at me .
second , he was extremely condescending and said i bought the wrong size band .
$ _num_ i would have agreed to , but $ _num_ for that ?
rip off !
no , just no !
drove a long way for nothing .
not a great way to gain new customers .
i questioned him why did he do that to my watch .
bad experience ... .
stopped by here recently with my mom to look for glasses for her .
needless to say we will not be back if we have a choice .
the unfortunate part about those two items is that they were both cold .
they did n't even start making it till i got here .
additionally , they got my order wrong !
we were on hold for over _num_ minutes and then hung up on us .
this place is a rip off !
disappointed again !
i used to order frequently but that will stop after these last visits .
dirty lobby and dinning room .
i really hate writing bad reviews , but this store has really bad pizza .
this pizza hut is not okay .
( however , the delivery guy was great .
just a fail all around .
this is the closest pizza hut to where i live .
keep in mind , i live about _num_ mile away .
this pizza hut is terrible .
their service could n't be worse .
it was absolutely horrible .
i 'm sorry but that 's unacceptable .
we canceled our order and are never ordering from this pizza hut again .
of course it 's cold ... .
this place clearly lacks in delivery and customer service .
Negative
order was almost _num_ minutes late .
rude employees and told me i was n't allowed to order from them again .
pasta was dry and crusty .
this place was just as it is reviewed .
when i went to pick it up , the place appeared dingy .
after just about throwing up , i threw out the food .
not paying attention when u r paying with card .
love pizza hut hate this location .
one of the worst locations !
called _num_ weeks ago and it was n't any dough .
however , there was no other car in the place .
i am still haunted by this bathroom experience .
he says how about $ _num_ off and i agree .
not at this time .
do you want premium , high temp oil ?
no just regular oil .
no ... .
the pressure is too high . ''
no more jiffy lube for this girl !
which did not feel genuine .
i would certainly not come back to this location for the unwelcoming environment .
there is simply nothing jiffy about this place .
i have replaced bulbs before so declined .
i went to replace them only to find out neither were burned out .
and i still had _num_ miles left u til next oil change .
either you are all careless assholes it you 're stupid .
the last half an hour , i was the only customer .
i am beyond upset and no i do n't want any more services !
it 's a mess .
i do n't give bad reviews .
friendly staff , but way too expensive for a simple oil change .
i will not be coming back here again .
they called _num_ hours later and said it would be done in _num_ minutes .
could you not call and let us know ?
the man that did my locks was extremely unpleasant .
had an emergency & would not give me time of day .
used in past but would never , ever go back .
just ugh .
no thanks .
there was no greeting just a dirty look .
when i saw followed i mean through every aisle !
as i expected she was rude throughout the entire transaction .
on the bright side pat was very kind as we walked out .
bottom line : do your self a favor and do n't stop by here .
in other words , skip this one for your health .
and could have saved me from buying tires all together but did not .
tires were not leaking air just the rim .
disappointed in this decision .
_num_ hours sitting at a shop to fix the rim .
this is not the way i wanted to spend my entire saturday morning .
i 'll be going elsewhere next time .
manager overheard everything ... nobody said sorry or try to fix the problem !
he quoted me a price $ _num_ higher than i paid a month ago !
i went in to get my tire change .
when my car was returned to me , the cash was gone .
this is an all time low .
went to this location because one of my tire 's was losing air .
single .
finding a new doctor because of this unfortunately .
so disappointing !
he seemed very rushed as well .
of course driving by the name caught my attention , so why not !
a normal routine filling turned into a $ _num_ root canal and crown .
does n't make much sense .
he was short with his words and the whole room felt awkward at times .
maybe he just needs to stick with breasts !
do n't let him touch your face !
for that service alone i would n't write them off .
we ended up calling aaa and having it towed to their business .
i 'm very much offended that they tried to con me .
this is the worst break masters in town .
save your money please do n't make my mistake .
posted on the window is $ _num_ oil change .
i will not be back .
your employee was rude and tried to charge more to a customer .
in general , it was slightly above average for typical chinese food fair .
the fried duck was overcooked and dry .
the other things thing sauteed string beans and shrimp with sizzling rice were alright .
let 's just say it was n't the best meal i ever had .
i have no idea how this place gets _num_ 1/2 stars on here .
it was the worst chinese food i have ever eaten .
the eggrolls were overpriced and are more like a spring roll .
ordered some thing simple , mongolian beef .
i took a few bites and i was disgusted how raw the beef was .
i do n't mean med rare or rare .
it was so unappetizing i just threw it in the trash .
i ca n't find one redeeming quality about what i ate .
do n't even get me started on the wife 's entree and soup !
what a waste of money !
it was awful .
the chicken wings were raw , not just under cooked .
the ridiculous reply was .
`` you bit into the wings , so no refund . ''
the crab puffs were missing a key ingredient ... .
that was really disappointing .
not sure we will give them another try .
horrible food .
an hour and _num_ minute wait - are you kidding me ?
what a disappointing experience .
the crab puffs appeared stale and tasteless .
i spent over _num_ dollars in this order and it was a complete waste .
no lobster in seafood platter .
pushy and rude waitress .
$ _num_ for some noodles and burnt chicken .
however , they do not skimp on the fortune cookies .
reasonably priced but the food was not good .
the mongolian beef had a weird taste to it and made my friend sick .
the orange chicken was bland .
probably wo n't be ordering again .
it was just on the other side of gross .
everything else ordered hurt everyone 's stomach after they ate it .
such a sad , sad change .
noise all the time , and now i feel completely unsafe in my neighborhood .
the landscaping is no longer attended to in a timely manner .
so this is why people come and go here.
but alas , the owner .
would n't you want this too ?
but your job is to b.s .
did your company help , hell no !
after she left , monica replaced her .
this turned out to be a big mistake .
the lights barely make it to the ground .
just look at the lights and ask yourself why ?
is this what i pay rent every month for ?
that 's a complete lie .
unfortunately , the stain was still there when we got everything back .
said you 're an hour late ca n't help you .
said you 're an hour late ca n't help you .
that 's just bad bad customer service .
normally love this place but today was disappointing .
also had a coupon that she was annoyed that i had .
if this happens again , may need to start looking for a new cleaner .
i probably should have yelped it before i went there .
but i was on the road and craving a rice bowl .
ordered the house chicken togo .
very disappointed ... never going back !
bad food , bad service .
the beef broccoli tasted like dead cats .
so i ate it .
the staff can barely speak english ... dont think i will return .
this place serves a poor excuse for japanese food .
not terrible food , but not good either .
it was beef , cabbage , and onion over rice .
there was a sauce used , but it might have just been soy sauce .
this place was just extremely underwhelming .
i was trying to be healthy and ordered a vegetable bowl with brown rice .
it was very bland .
which looked way better than what i ordered .
the worst food i 've ever had .
the teriyaki sauce tasted bland and watered down .
the vegetables were limp and flavor less .
and the beef was like thinly sliced cheap roast beef .
the whole experience was a waste of money and time .
i will never step foot in this establishment again .
i could have gotten a better tasting rice bowl at jack in the box .
i do n't know how this place stays open .
the food is horrible .
i paid approximately $ _num_ for nothing but brown rice .
chicken was old .
i essentially put $ _num_ dollars in trash can .
then leaves it like that .
there is no comfortable seating to be found anywhere .
so , again , we had to wait for her to come around .
this place is a train wreck in a refrigerator .
it was so uncomfortable and very difficult to skate it in .
just awful .
run down dirty old facility that obviously is n't very well up kept .
this was just weird since the place is in large shopping center .
the roof is leaking for at least a week now , if not longer .
so the next day i called again and talked to him .
he did n't care at all that he did n't call me back .
if i could give zero stars , i would .
the repair is covered , and the guy should get paid .
so by this time , he was booked out for _num_ weeks .
not surprisingly , again the call never came .
this was june 25th .
i am so frustrated .
fred 's excuse over and over was that he is `` busy . ''
fred will not be busy for long .
would not recommend .
i had no problem adding a $ _num_ tip for the driver .
when the pizza was delivered , i noticed an additional $ _num_ charge .
it 's sad .
called 3x at 10:30 pm on a thursday and nobody picked up .
got into town late and so pizza delivery was our only choice .
as she was leaving i looked at the pizzas and both were wrong .
way too expensive !
you should n't have to pay $ _num_ for any pasta .
ridiculous .
not even that tasty .
this restaurant has gone downhill , while the prices have gone way up .
i mean $ _num_ - _num_ for pasta ?
come on now ... way overpriced and not that tasty .
gross .
food was overpriced and restaurant not that nice .
not very impressed , food was just ok.
this place sucks .
they were so close and so loud that we were part of their conversation .
the places was n't even full and there were empty tables !
there were barely any in the dish .
and the shrimps ... are you kidding me ?
very rude .
i do not understand how this restaurant has such high rating anywhere !
Positive
it tasted bitter and bland and lacking any real preparation .
there was no flavor or depth or excitement at all !
overpriced entrees , underwhelming food .
unfortunately , we were significantly disappointed .
lobster was a bit rubbery and dish had very little flavor .
cold scallops followed after a very long wait by hardly cooked lukewarm pasta .
cold plates and food .
the worst ever !
our food was cold and tasteless .
a group of us were celebrating our daughters graduation from law school .
there were _num_ of us and the restaurant was not busy .
once we were not happy our server disappeared as did the other staff .
do not waste your money at this restaurant !
i was billed $ _num_ for this al la carte pasta dish .
unfortunately , the food was less than mediocre .
this is supposed to be one if not best italian restaurant in town .
many classic dish are offered and many different cut of pasta .
the quality does n't justify the stiff prices .
maybe grabbing another drink and a little bite to eat before we go home .
it was after 9pm saturday night .
mediocre at best .
the worst experience in my life .
no seasoning .
spinach ravioli was two large pieces , but missing sauce & seasoning .
it got worse from there .
our entrees were completely bland .
absent salt , pepper , and herbs of any kind .
this evening it was nothing like our previous experience .
the dishes were all lacking flavor .
i was so disappointed by the food .
very bland .
no flavor .
needless to say we wo n't be back .
the only one i 've seen all night .
all in all , $ _num_ before gratuity for an average meal .
visited for restaurant week and was disappointed .
portions were very small for the prix fix $ _num_ .
salad of field greens was tasteless .
i had the salmon which was very small and bland .
not sure how an italian restaurant has only one veal dish .
this happened before , and we pushed the additional tables together .
we walked in with a large party for a special occasion .
this has happened before , and we pushed the additional tables together .
i did n't ask his name again because he had such an attitude problem .
the worst part about this place was the remarkably awful service .
but your customer service and attention to detail is atrocious .
you ca n't fake diarrhea .
i do n't care why it happened .
like i said , you ca n't fake diarrhea .
was the wine that expensive ?
did we order anything extraordinary ?
are we going back ?
the foot was decent but i would not say outstanding .
-- just lettuce and tomato , nothing else .
the dressing was pretty bland too .
i do n't think i would return on purpose .
the only really positive things i can say are _num_ .
i did not have to pay because i was on company business and _num_ .
so , what seemed like a great deal was a huge disappointment .
it was just horrible after that .
nothing special .
the service was a little awkward .
i flagged down the next available employee and told them what we wanted .
it was very mediocre .
the food was not that great .
we ordered the gnocchi and it was way too doughy .
terrible service .
would not go back bc of service .
without waiting for a response or caring .
not even worth eating .
my boyfriend got the veal in marsala sauce that was flavorless boiled fatty veal .
was there a rush at lunch for plates of gnocchi ?
all of our expectations from previous experiences fell far short of this last visit .
five out of eight got food poisoning and all _num_ ate the caesar salad .
it 's unfortunate because we liked this place .
sad thing is how many other people got food poisoning that night .
decent donuts but horrible coffee ... .
the shop is not impressive nor are the donuts .
i can still feel the grease on the roof of my mouth .
donuts are stale , not enjoyable .
on my second visit , it was the same story .
i tried an old cinnamon roll and an old bavarian cream with chocolate icing .
Neutral
if i could give a negative rating i would .
that 's gross !
i guess it was just easier to put my bill into collections .
that i want to pay my bill .
that there was no reason for it to go into collections .
so i called back , she did n't answer so i left a message .
that was at 8am it 's now 6pm and no phone call back .
she told me she could not give me that kind of information .
every person we encountered was just miserable and it showed well .
i ca n't believe they call themselves professionals .
and `` no one can die from pain '' what !
meanwhile , my husband is laying there dying and screaming in pain .
Negative
i wish i could give them a negative rating .
do n't come here , go anywhere else !
had to wait _num_ hours to get checked into the emergency !
we were rushed to pack up and get out .
after about _num_ minutes i was taken to a room .
the doctor sucked !
the nurse said , no we 're waiting _num_ hours for more blood .
i was n't happy and i was still feeling terrible .
i was pissed !
watching people being brought back to see a doctor who have just walked in .
this is pathetic way of treating people .
dont come here , you have a better chance waiting for your doctor .
you could drop dead in the waiting room .
very disappointed in the customer service with this hospital !
i wish all of this could have been resolved from day _num_ .
horrible experience !
in the end horrible experience , horrible care , horrible education .
not going there again .
very long wait .
not sure what happened but it was very unprofessional .
i would highly suggest going to john c lincoln north mountain .
this place is a disgrace .
waste of my time and money .
the dr clearly did n't care for me at all .
terrible hospital to deal with once you 've left .
horrible experience !
they did n't even attempt to find out what was wrong .
the ct went well - and he was handled properly .
( that was after he had to have lower back surgery first ! )
how can they deny it happened ?
no idea how long he will be able to work now .
he lost _num_ % use of his shoulder !
she was horrible to both my son , my husband and the nurse .
i waited maybe _num_ minutes until the doctor came in .
the doctor ( dr. york ) was such an asshole .
is n't your job to cure people ?
the staff is still incompetent in the mri area .
if i could give zero stars i would .
the bread was hard like croutons & deserves a refund .
it 's better than nothing .
one warning , the home fries are typically undercooked .
no one in this world needs that much lettuce in one sitting .
the eggs and bacon were just bad .
i would rather have gone to mcdonalds honestly .
the food was put in styrofoam boxes even though we planned on dining in .
overall , it was a horrible experience .
no fries , no bun - just a patty .
hello , i 'm a huge panda lover .
my stomach turned and i instantly wanted all that food out of my stomach .
hit or miss .
Negative
all of the negative reviews do not surprise me .
i 'm not expecting gourmet food here .
however this visit was disappointing .
when we got our order the orange chicken tasted dried out .
very disappointed .
it took me longer than if i 'd walked in .
not sure i 'd do the online thing again .
i 'll be throwing the leftovers away .
the sicilian was greasy and bland , the regular was bland and chewy .
yelp totally led me wrong here !
i called ahead , ordered _num_ large pepperoni pizza .
eventually , my overpriced pizza was ready , and i drove home .
this thing looked terrible .
there were literally pools of grease .
i understand , new york style pizza , but this was ridiculous .
it was very similar to trying to eat cardboard .
it was ridiculous .
i 've had pizza from little caesars that blew that pizza away .
this review is for the sicilian pizza , with pepperoni , sausage and basil .
i just did n't care for this version of pizza .
nice guys , but that does n't help the pizza taste any better .
not impressed , nor a fan .
i had to add a third slice just so i could eat there .
the pizza was thin , no sauce and topped nice with cheese .
the entire thing was flavorless .
none not the sauce or the crust .
i doubt i would be back .
we wo n't be trying this place again .
plus , the place smells like an old grease pit .
the sauce was average and , like the cheese , not plentiful enough .
it was n't any better cold the next day .
unfortunately , it was awful .
the sauce was missing !
it just tasted like dough .
my boyfriend could n't even finish it and he is not a picky eater .
what a waste of money !
well , we were very disappointed .
it was not as good as he or i remembered .
the pizza was extremely bland and not very flavorful at all .
it was very vinegary .
really expected more from this place .
i made my own large pepperoni and sausage pizza .
the dough was pretty horrific .
it was hard and had a very bland taste to it .
avoid this place at all costs .
the pizza looks like toasted texas toast bread with some toppings on it .
that was the only good thing about it .
the mozzarella sticks were cold .
the salad that comes with the pasta had more onions on it the lettuce .
the garlic bread was not good .
never gon na order from there again .
the pizza really had no flavor .
i will not go back .
are you kidding me ?
i have spent hundreds of dollars at this store .
my wife and i generally do n't carry cash on us .
that being said , i have no interest in going back .
according to him , impossible .
she promised to talk to eric and get back to me .
her response was in no way reassuring that service was going to get better .
they say he fell and hit his head on the corner of a table .
makes me wonder if he actually fell or did something else happen .
unfortunately , yelp does n't have a zero star option .
i went in here to check out the facility .
the lady was rude and kept asking un needed questions .
highly do not recommend this place .
seems very poorly run .
apparently they did not renew their business license or something .
here is why we left and why i post a bad review .
i wish there was a minus one .
omg never in my entire life have i ever encountered such a chaotic place .
to which i turned around and walked out .
it was worse than bad .
there is no excuse for this .
the husband , i hate to say it ... is horrible .
unfortunately the husband did them .
horrible job , is an understatement !
they look like garbage .
he says dumb & rude things .
you sure , she do n't look anything like you '' wtf !
he was so rude .
i guess i will limit my shopping to frozen foods or smoking deals .
the checkout clerks are maybe a little outdated like the store itself .
oh and make sure you check expiration dates on the products .
_num_ star because i ca n't give _num_ .
ugh .
_num_ .
the service : long lines and unpleasant cashiers .
_num_ .
_num_ .
produce : maybe in this store they should just no offer produce .
the calls always come through as adobe carpet cleaning .
do not use these people .
_num_ is the number they call from .
bad company .
Neutral
check negative reviews on bbb site and here on yelp .
they wasted my time and money and taught me a lesson .
adobe has done furniture cleaning for me before .
no conditioner , nada .
never assume , just makes an ass out of u and me !
adobe carpet cleaning is unethical and you should never do business with them .
never use adobe carpet cleaning .
nope these people suck in scheduling , communication and cleaning the carpet .
i do not recommend them !
i should have read these reviews prior to hiring adobe !
what a waste of money !
_num_ day guarantee forget that !
it 's no surprise that so many of those who did are unhappy .
you wo n't have to call these folks because they will call you .
far , far away .
stop calling my home .
i do n't even have any carpeting !
well , they did not make the 2pm appointment by a long shot .
i got to believe they have ripped off so many people already .
horrible is the only word i could use .
warning warning do not use these people .
this is one of those companies that you will wish you never dealt with .
anyways , i have an older car and the check engine light came on .
i mean , most other shops do it for $ _num_ or for free .
that 's a $ _num_ price difference !
i had an _num_ am appointment for an oil change and head light problem .
they are extremely overpriced and do n't care about the customer .
i 've been going here for over _num_ yrs but no longer .
so i had it checked out elsewhere .
nothing had changed here in two decades .
the restaurant interior looked exactly as i had remembered .
just fish and dry cabbage in a tortilla ?
first , she 's not a new waitress .
no slaw dressing , not even a lime .
nasty !
that explains why they were so salty .
as for the service it was average , not anything special .
the food here gives a whole new meaning to the word bland .
Neutral
i 'd rather be positive than negative so they get three .
i really have nothing good to say about any part of our visit .
all and all a very disappointing trip .
the pork tasted dried , rubbery , and days old .
between us , we ate three bites of it and put it aside .
my husband 's dinner , pollo fundido , was not any better .
waited _num_ minutes for our waitress .
maybe it has changed but i will never step foot there ever again .
food was ok i guess but the service was horrible .
horrible experience .
the service was good , but the food lacked flavor and was quite bland .
the re fried beans were overcooked and were simply bad .
the queso app was ok , but nothing special .
the husband had a shredded beef enchilada & taco combo .
then prices went up and quality declined .
it is now made with cheap ingredients and tastes like oil .
it is pretty bad and the salsa has taken a real dive too .
now it seems like an overpriced fast food place .
but that 's really all i would recommend .
everything else is mediocre and super cheesy .
also , with the size , there is never a wait .
the skinny margaritas are not that good .
but not worth the effort when i have better closer to my house .
tacos were soaked in grease .
phoenix just doesnt know how to do mexican food ... .
they were very drunk , and the waiter continued to serve them .
they were obnoxious , yelling f bombs constantly .
the rice and beans were perfectly cooked , no issues there .
loaded with crap it did not even taste good .
after that , our tacos were not so appetizing !
too bad because my boyfriend loves this place .
atmosphere is very dated .
spicy wings are too spicy .
terrible .
long wait , food was a mess and unappealing .
one of the worst places i 've been .
for such a big venue it was extremely empty .
the food was so bland .
i could have made dinner that night for way cheaper .
not sure what 's happened to this place but it has gone down hill .
completely unsatisfied with the service and food .
as for the food , it had no taste !
will not recommend this place or go back .
there are too many other authentic places in town to come here .
good food bad service .
this is not the place it used to be .
we ordered a cheese crisp and it came out limp and not very hot .
waitress had another cooked and this time the bottom layer tasted like a cracker .
so disappointed .
portion was just smaller .
then to our favorite pollo fundido .
inside was dry .
so disappointing .
one star only because no stars are not an option .
worst experience !
in the mean while , we found napkins to wipe down the dirty tables .
all was terrible !
the worst was the fajitas which were bland .
needless to say , they where still terrible .
not edible .
of course another _num_ min went by before she brought us the check .
it has a dirty feel to it .
the chips they brought us tasted bland and were t my favorite .
be warned that the ground beef tacos are n't very good .
the meat had little to no seasoning !
sadly , this was definitely not the case .
first of all , they were red ; not brown , but red .
the salsa in general needs more garlic and cilantro , in my opinion .
not a chance .
it just was n't that good , nor was the service very friendly .
not good .
lets just say , it is hard to screw up mexican food .
the jalepeno cheese muffins were good .
just very confusing .
overall , confusing and strange .
after waiting that whole time for the food the food was cold .
ick !
nothing like a _num_ pound pizza full of oil & cheese .
i do n't like sweet marinara or pizza sauce .
oh well , no big deal .
went to kitchen to inspect pizza .
this household does n't eat animals .
i was so excited to try it because people rave .
not a fan .
i could n't eat it .
i have to say i was extremely disappointed .
the salad is something i would expect from a lousy fast food place .
the pizza was flavorless and the crust was just a soggy mush .
i will not be eating her again .
he was unfortunately , terribly wrong .
the sauce has a strange tangy flavor to it and the toppings were flavorless .
sauce was a little sweeter and did n't have any special flavor .
pizza seemed like it had too much cheese .
not the pizza for me .
this is a terrible place to try to take a large group .
the food is mediocre at best .
but they run the place poorly .
she was told it would be _num_ minutes .
unfortunately , their waiting area is very packed and does not hold _num_ comfortably .
we left , i will never go back .
it should not be a hassle to take your family out to eat .
the main reason for eating out is to avoid hassle .
placed an order for delivery online for the first time tonight .
gross .
waist of money , time and my stomach hurt like hell .
terrible !
( and we 're not talking about a picky kid here .
are you kidding me ?
we sat in a front room with a bunch of fake cakes .
honestly , the cake ranged from ok to very not good .
that raspberry filling was atrocious .
just so you know , they charge _num_ $ for tastings .
ok so on april _num_ , _num_ me and my husband were married .
i 'm not going to lie the cake was beautiful and it tasted great .
she even ventured to say `` this has happened before ! ''
i wish i could give zero stars .
sassy glasses falls short everywhere else however .
overpriced , poor quality , bad customer service .
do n't waste your money .
why be arrogant .
but the bugs really are too much .
i would never renew my lease at this disgusting place .
the worst though are the people at the leasing office .
the office is a nightmare situation .
i 'm so glad to be gone !
be sure to check my review in the non recommended section .
i would not recommend this community .
neither one of these things are in the lease in any shape or form .
the front office is an absolute mess .
upon move out , they have so many hidden fees and charges .
no matter what condition you leave your apartment in ) .
lastly , we were overcharged during our _num_ month lease .
we also referred a friend and were never given our $ _num_ referral bonus .
started off great and ended very poorly .
our experience quickly was spoiled by the apartment quality and management staff .
i was told this error would be resolved within a day or two .
terrible !
after moving i still owed $ _num_ .
no one at the office was competent to explain the invoice .
one star only because i ca n't give them _num_ stars .
what i did n't like was the massive amounts of cockroaches on the grounds .
it was disgusting .
that kind of dirty carpet is never going to stay clean .
any dirt added to the old stains will bring them to the surface again .
why the hell did i waste my time cleaning ?
the only good thing is the view of north mountain .
terrible place where the people make you feel like sh*t about yourself .
they were n't supportive and almost made things worse with lies filled with fear .
not recommended at all .
not cool .
i was there for _num_ minutes and she did n't even say hello !
i would not recommend this pharmacy to anyone .
my complaint number at the az state board of pharmacy is _num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
what happened safeway , did you guys get new managers .
because you just fell into the category of walmart .
the place has gone downhill a little bit .
i looked ridiculous when it started to grow back too .
perfect haircut , not too short , straight razor and hot towel .
so rude .
i would not take my children back here .
they do not speak english when there is a problem .
the guy who cut my sons hair was terribly rude .
that was so creepy .
i 've been going to this store a lot beginning of the year .
owner is there almost always , ready to address and help with anything possible .
$ _num_ for two f @ # $ % & !
outrageous rip off .
nobody bothered to warn me of pricing before sending anything .
that is an absurd price .
the hours say that this store opens at 7:30 .
i called their phone number and i got an answering machine .
this is the single worst restaurant i 've ever been to , anywhere .
not good .
not impressed .
not really impressed .
chips were just extra greasy , salsa watered down , meals without much taste .
the food is not even mediocre it sucks !
unfortunately i was unimpressed with the food .
the chips were light and crispy but the salsa tasted pretty generic .
unfortunately , the service was really slow .
not sure .
spinach enchiladas were mushy and flavorless - probably frozen spinach and too much cheese .
chicken enchiladas were so-so , a little heavy on the sauce .
service is tolerable , speed is tolerable , ambiance is tolerable .
it was downhill from there .
they , however , are not the meal .
i find the food to be bland with a mushy texture .
the last unfortunate meal i ate there , we were seated by a group .
the server never came to collect my card so we could leave .
that said , the food was sorely lacking .
in other words , they were very flaky .
for my drink , i ordered a frozen mango margarita with salt .
the mango flavoring was faint and there was very little salt on the glass .
the chile relleno was the worst one i 've ever had .
it held together very poorly .
the chicken enchilada was generous with the chicken portion but pretty forgettable .
bad , just bad .
are you kidding me ?
big mistake .
then i tasted my incredibly weak margherita , all sweet , horrible .
drink , but whats the point if it sucks .
this is the type of badly run , corporate restaurant i can not stand .
that being said , tonight was a disaster .
so , i get it in a sense .
it would 've saved me a lot of time .
look elsewhere , would be my advice .
not a fan of that .
which brings me to my third point , the service was pretty bad .
i have never been treated so badly .
big mistake !
the server , cindy , was the worst !
she was so rude .
the food came and it was awful .
they were completely dry and almost inedible .
i can not believe the treatment we received .
this woman should not be in the service industry .
but this behavior was inexcusable and shocking .
cindy was the rudest server i have ever had .
every time i have gone there for food i have had a horrible experience .
they have very limited choices for vegetarians .
now , i understand mexican food is not vegetarian friendly .
i am half mexican myself .
i am usually able to ignore it if i ca n't taste it .
i told him i was a vegetarian and ordered the cheese quesadilla .
he informed me that there was lard in the tortilla .
my $ _num_ ticket included a buffet full of lard .
maybe traditional in your family .
bacon was a luxury .
at my reunion , the bartender they had in the banquet room was awful .
a rude , angry bitter old man .
just warning anyone who might have an event here .
parking is weird .
the front entrance is not where the parking lot is .
the salsa and chips are overrated .
the carne asada burrito was horrible .
it tasted like charred asada .
the chips might have been the worst we have had .
when it finally arrived _num_ of us asked for side of sour cream .
unfortunately it never came .
otherwise she would not have seen much .
nasty .
terrible service , hotel food .
i only ordered drinks and had some chips and salsa .
drinks were good but the chips and salsa were n't great .
not impressed .
i have no hispanic background , so i am not sure what is traditional .
with that said , i really hope you come back . ''
direct quotes .
is n't this breaking some sort of yelp rule ?
there are many better choices .
ate dinner here a week ago .
did not like the food .
my husband ordered a chimichanga , which he was not impressed with .
we did n't get that warm fuzzy feeling we used to get while visiting .
i guess starving students are less likely to notice cold food ?
i would rather pay than eat that buffet again .
not excited to try that again .
just very cheesy and greasy and i am sure a fat and calorie bomb !
-the cheese crisp was ok .
i can make better mexican , and i 'm asian .
what the hell ?
i have never experienced a restaurant go down the toilet so fast .
its like a bad night in mexico .
service sucked , but the food sucked more .
well , got off to a bad start .
i wish i would have ordered something else .
_num_ .
_num_ who puts black olives in their salsa ?
_num_ .
_num_ .
my family went for lunch on a weekday .
there was some sort of work banquet going on in a back room .
unfortunately , there were times that she disappeared for way too long .
_num_ .
half of the orders placed had something wrong with them .
_num_ .
i think it is long overdue for a cleaning .
_num_ .
i was sad that this last experience was so marginal .
food was average but i give it _num_ stars because the service was terrible .
this place is horrible unless all you want to do is drink alcohol .
nothing but poor service and poorly cooked food .
our server was not even closely familiar with the food or food preparation .
no bueno !
anyway , i was then informed that they cook their beans with bacon .
so there went the idea of a burrito , a tostada .
depressing .
terrible experience , do n't sit on the patio .
the place was slow so there was no excuse .
we walked out .
it is nothing but chewy meat covered in cheap cheese and grease .
i have tried a few different dishes , and they were not very good .
we had called _num_ hours earlier to get a table for _num_ .
they were not set up for us when we arrived .
we had to have them turn the fireplace off as it was too hot .
i tried to order huevos rancheros which is not on the dinner menu .
i 've eaten at this restaurant before when visiting phoenix .
so dissatisfied we went to denny 's afterwards .
sour cream and lime extra charge for your tacos ?
not going to eat here again .
it was pretty forgettable .
no seasoning whatsoever .
waited _num_ min for food , we walked out .
the service was so so bad .
disgusting !
the restaurant is dark the ceilings are filthy .
thank god we walked out when we did !
i give it _num_ star for diet pepsi .
probably wo n't be back .
on the border is almost better mexican food ... and that place is terrible !
too late ; we had to sit inside .
the server was so rude that we asked for another .
they got at least two orders wrong - three times !
they refused to split the tab .
the food was typical mexican food .
i ca n't remember worse service at a restaurant .
the food is n't so great here .
i watched two seats at their bar remain dirty and empty for _num_ minutes .
like they are too good to clean it .
they were n't even that busy .
omg the food was horrible and lacked taste at best .
the guac was worse than what comes from a bag !
food weak bland , lacked interest or taste .
the only dish that appeared worth ordering was the street tacos .
they try hard , but it looks like the staff is on their own .
probably my last visit unless there is a serious change .
disappointed in the food .
the items we ordered were flavorless .
our server was seriously super slow .
the place looks old and outdated , especially for a hotel type restaurant .
for dessert , which were all polished off .
i was here a good _num_ years ago .
my how things go bad so quickly !
my son almost fell after sitting in a broken chair .
the old put the store bought chips on the bottom trick .
i should have walked then but everyone was tired of waiting and hungry .
the food i ordered was ok .
i can eat fire so this is no surprise .
my son 's cheese quesadilla had tomatoes in it .
at first i told him it was just one and i picked it off .
i called the waitress over and explained .
i had already told her it had tomatoes all over in it .
nope , he left it there so someone else could trip on it .
he was loud enough for everyone to hear in the room .
drinks not refilled !
food took _num_ minutes to come out on a slow night .
another _num_ minutes for our check to come back .
i 'll never go back again .
just nothing to write home about .
of course this pissed me off .
that did not make it ok .
the waiter should have said something to us and did n't .
disappointed .
food was awful , not good at all .
tried it once and probably will not come back again .
overall , not a good experience .
skip the queso .
vegetarians beware everything is made w/ meat .
ugh .
safe w/ grilled veggies .
she was obviously having a bad night and took it out on us .
their flour tortillas were awful !
do n't bother with this place .
another disappointment .
the potatoes tasted like they 'd been in the freezer too long .
i just wo n't recommend it or plan to return .
myself & family had horrible experience at this establishment .
the food is no where nearly as good as tempe location .
i rather go to tempe location which is much better .
never coming back to this establishment .
a terrible hh !
food was so-so , i did like the fried flour tortilla chips .
but the red chile burritos are beef and not pork .
_num_ for a tortilla after paying $ _num_ for a fajita plate .
either our tastes have changed , or this place has really gone downhill .
not a fan of the flour tortilla chips , though .
reduced appetizers during the week , free buffet on fridays .
i doubt we 'll be back .
not good .
then only a partial delivery .
my carnitas tacos came out cold and dry .
the place is obviously very poorly managed .
it made for an unpleasant dinner .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
charging us for a quesadilla and not bringing it , not ok !
_num_ .
eating here is not recommended ... .
the only saving grace was tonight 's band ... .
rice & beans were no better or worse than other restaurants in this class .
overall , not bad , but i probably will not be back .
i went in on tuesday at 2pm and it was very slow .
it took about _num_ minutes to get our drinks and mine came out incorrectly .
for a slow period , communication should be on point .
the place sucks .
cheap food , cheap service .
horrible restaurant manager .
that 's why you 're getting this horrible review .
the bartender was a bitch too with attitude .
i had the beef fajitas and they were very tough .
chips and a bottle of water showed up pretty quickly but unfortunately no glasses .
we sat there for about _num_ minutes without seeing anyone else .
_num_ - _num_ of them yelling and screaming and running around .
it was the first time there were so many and so loud .
never would one of my teams been this obnoxious and rude .
this team was an embarrassment to your program .
the past few visits i 've noticed a decline in the service .
overall wasted an hour just on wait time .
wo n't be returning .
a boring bean burrito is _num_ dollars !
i wo n't be visiting this location again .
they were overcooked and oddly spiced .
the beer was cold though .
maybe they should n't have their food sitting out though .
left a _num_ % tip on credit card receipt .
not impressed .
be sure to check your credit card statement .
one of the worst dining experiences i 've had in a long time .
i know , i live here .
never had pasta in a mexican restaurant .
no grill marks , not seasoning , bland taste and very poor presentation .
overall it was a poor experience for me and i would not return .
note : they did remove the fajitas from the bill .
beans taste like dirt .
we probably had at least _num_ cups of wasted guac left on the table .
our bill was $ _num_ for five people drinking water .
very disappointed in this store .
while walking around , i almost felt like a criminal .
it 's just not a nice thing to do to someone !
# _num_ : do n't be rude to customers .
my other prescriptions will remain at walgreens .
he will not stop complaining about the company .
she was in severe pain .
sent her home w/ _num_ prescriptions .
_num_ hours later they call .
will not use cvs again .
walgreens here we come , we 'll try anywhere else .
honestly the worst , i stood at the pharmacy counter for _num_ mins .
idiots now i 'm calling there corporate .
i think that this was the worst decision i made for our wedding .
she 's nice but for the price we paid , we were so disappointed .
i would not recommend her .
i could not rely on her care if my dog was ill .
all of the electrical went out shortly after .
i would definitely not recommend being a customer .
very poor customer service !
first off , upon meeting the owner , ray , i was really impressed .
not good .
based on my experience , i can not recommend this shop .
another bonus is the $ _num_ drink .
however , the tea was not fresh .
it was gross and i threw it away .
shame on you for not keeping fresh tea on hand on a hot day !
went in on saturday around 2pm .
_num_ hamburgers - _num_ plain , _num_ regular .
first off , apparently the employees do n't know the products they are selling .
do not do business with this guy ... .
do not get propane refills at this location !
been going to this location for past _num_ years w old manager mike .
ok so i was going to a movie and i really wanted a coffee .
this was the most watered down coffee i 've ever tasted in my life .
yeah , that happened to me .
bank of wasting my time is what their name should be changed to .
going through all of the mail items ( _num_ separate pieces of mail !
Neutral
i wish i could do negative stars .
i would n't wish this bank on my worst enemy !
worst bank of america !
of course , after spending _num_ minutes there i 'm not going to wait .
the sandwich is mediocre like you can make it at home for $ _num_ ?
on a tank top all sloppy it does n't look professional .
this used to be our favorite coffee spot .
seems to have gone down hill a bit .
not the same friendly employees and quality is lacking .
this is not a four star coffee joint .
first impression was of an extremely dirty run down shop .
they had none so they had to make it fresh .
the coffee taste was lacking in all senses to the taste buds .
what i am writing about is how i was treated recently .
it 's been a week and it has n't cleared .
she did n't have a reason for it .
and no we both have separate vehicles he hates my car .
horrible customer service !
very disappointed with this company .
they stuck us with this obnoxious company .
they are rude unprofessional and generally default to horrible .
if i could give less than _num_ star i would .
she never explained anything that was happening or that she was doing to me .
this place is a money mill ... that is all .
still have yet to see him .
not impressed .
( see photo ) i asked for grey and the color is more brown .
my polish is uneven and she did n't get the sides very well .
they are also filed uneven .
do not go to this nail shop .
terrible place to get nails done .
worst gel mani of my life .
the lady was really rude .
she literally covered my cuticles .
i asked her to fix it and she said oh so sorry too late .
no manager or owner on duty .
thanks for wasting my time and money .
she used a rude tone to say that .
and did n't even look at me.
that is terrible !
very bad experience in that place ... not recommended at all ... .
the food tends to be very salty ( which americans tend to like ) .
so disappointing .
i think ramen noodles tasted better and cost only _num_ cents .
pei wei -- i miss the good times .
if you are expecting a great meal , go elsewhere .
pei wei is a good not so fast version of fast food .
pei wei is also a bit overpriced for what it is .
i just never go with the expectation that i will get my correct order .
portions have been reduced and sandwiches have been added to the menu .
the bad news - i just really do n't get it .
it is like pei wei with a few odd items and higher prices .
the portions and prices have been reduced , but seems to be more expensive .
my family was thoroughly disappointed in the quality of food that was served .
i sent it back and another salad was given to me without dressing .
i got a refund and went to paradise bakery down the street .
i really like pei wei but i will never go back to this location .
it seems like they just do n't care .
it 's not the same quality as it was when it opened .
second , i walked in and two young girls were standing at the counter .
& i will not come back again .
it is a friday night at _num_ o'clock and this restaurant is empty .
i 'm not sure what to think anymore .
have been back since they switched back though .
somehow the food does n't seem as good .
today was really strange though .
not at all how i used to remember pei wei food .
maybe it 's just this location , but the food has been terrible .
like the broccoli was old and should 've just been thrown out .
grossed me out .
lost all interest after that .
all empty tables were dirty - all eight tables .
it was lunchtime and busy .
6:30 thursday pm .
no sushi .
no silverware .
no water cups .
service like mcdonald 's counter .
after ordering , i sat so that i was facing the kitchen .
it 's a low key place with some interesting folks .
drinks are cheap .
my boyfriend and i visited big daddy 's for lunch on a thursday .
the restaurant is out dated and dingy on the inside .
would we return to big daddy 's ?
probably not .
the wife and i have n't been in since football season last year .
came in tonight for monday night football , the place was empty .
did n't take long to figure out why .
no monday night happy hour .
no happy hour any day of the week .
_num_ cent wings is not gon na keep us coming back .
the staff most times are just rude .
that was ridiculous .
it took her _num_ hours to call back .
that was it , no explanation and she hung up .
there is no in house x-ray .
the next morning , went to x-ray place # _num_ .
after i left i was mad enough to call .
i get that proceeds go to charity , but damn .
i most likely wo n't ever go back .
used flat screens from the early _num_ 's priced at $ _num_ !
crappy tables priced at _num_ dollars .
every time i come here i 'm very disappointed with the pricing .
i was extremely disappointed by the rude treatment i received .
i would not recommend this shop to anyone .
horrible service , their staff has zero customer service and are extremely slow .
if you have no standards , this place is for you .
i came here with a group of _num_ on saturday morning for breakfast .
i wish i could give it no stars .
i had lunch there , and the service was terrible .
skip it , even if you have a free voucher from the hotel .
the food was so salty it was almost inedible .
do n't bother .
stayed at the hotel for _num_ days .
the dinner left a lot to be desired .
it came all mixed together not on side .
this place needs to do a better job !
the food selection sucked , and our cheese platter was sub-par .
what a waste of space .
_num_ stars is my rating for this restaurant .
no so my fellow yelpers , not so .
it 's expensive and our meal was completely forgettable .
i had scallops and fettuccine which was uneven .
the pasta was seriously undercooked .
what a disappointment .
head office had the salmon which she said was fine .
let 's just say the food was definitely lacking .
maybe try it medium instead of medium well next time ?
horrible service !
our waiter took _num_ minutes to greet us and the busser apologized _num_ times .
the busser was great but you could tell very frustrated .
steak fries came and were uncooked .
sea bass good but dry .
no sign , one lady holding door shut , other cleaning .
noted they did not have proper equipment or body fluid pick up supplies ?
good waiter but horrible food .
brussel sprouts were soggy also .
the bottom looked and tasted rotten like curd .
i immediately felt sick after eating the creme brulee .
my rule number two is dont make people wait on the check .
i was really looking forward to having dinner here .
boy oh boy , what a disappointment !
gordon ramsey would have had a fit .
no dessert , as we were pretty disgusted with the whole experience .
the food was hit and miss .
_num_ star atmosphere .
service sucked .
Negative
for a restaurant in this price range i 'd give it negative _num_ stars .
waiter was extremely inattentive .
this is _num_ % inexcusable for a restaurant in this price range .
desserts where completely underwhelming and generic in options and taste .
Negative
considering the prices , i prefer to give this place negative _num_ stars .
if you want to enjoy the view , simply stop by for drinks .
we wo n't return or recommend this place .
simply put , this placed sucked .
finally , the food was really salty !
i 'd seriously give this place _num_ stars if that were possible .
we had visited last year but got to the restaurant too late for sunset .
they did n't let us know ( we had reservations ) until we arrived .
this was extremely disappointing .
very disappointing .
unbelievable and extremely disappointing .
my husband had never tried them so we took a chance .
we also ordered the kobe beef sliders and the tomato salad .
maybe if the bread was warmed a bit it would have been better .
none of the parts were awesome and together they were just ok .
i was kind of disappointed because the place had such great ratings .
the focaccia bread was kind of bland and dry .
there were _num_ dipping sides offered with the bread , which were very good .
my dinner arrived hot and the halibut was bland and little overcooked .
friday night dinner service and out of bread ?
the waiter offered us comp deserts for the trouble , at least .
the waiter said they `` were out of bags '' .
maybe my expectations are too high since i 'm from chicago ( ?
my girlfriend and i decided to book reservations for this restaurant .
after waiting _num_ mins the hostess let us know our table was ready .
already upset by the poor first impression i walked out before i was seated .
the staff i encountered were rude and arrogant .
terrible experience and i will never go back .
it 's ridiculous and so not worth going to .
i wo n't be coming back .
i am so disappointed with this place .
the food was mediocre but priced at fine dining prices .
would not go back .
the case had a yelp sticker on it .
was very excited to finally come here but left disappointed .
i then tried the shrimp appetizer with quinoa .
no one at our table cared for the taste .
)
we get there and there are about _num_ weddings going on .
service was slow and inattentive .
the guy knew i was gluten free because i had a few questions .
waiter brought by dessert menus .
_num_ minutes later he came back over and asked us what we wanted .
no candles .
took _num_ more minutes after this for us to finally get our check .
horrible experience for such a special occasion .
the girl put me on hold for _num_ minutes and forgot about me .
thanks for wasting my time on hold .
i would give zero stars if possible .
we will not be back .
good view with bad breath waiter !
the food was ok but not great .
the view was amazing , the food was not .
we were very disappointed .
our service however , was not .
went saturday night for restaurant week menu .
would not go back .
soon to realize i had gotten food poisoning , from this amazingly rated restaurant .
i 'm so disappointed , it 's unreal .
food was good but service was terrible .
just walked away .
after explaining the situation to her , her response added insult to injury .
this is shocking customer service coming from a resort with multiple _num_ diamond ratings .
there were a total of _num_ people there .
i was n't bothering anyone nor was i costing them any extra money .
wow ... what a disappointment !
we went to a nicer and friendlier place in scottsdale .
awful , rude women working there .
this was my third experience and never again .
i would n't recommend this place .
bought a dryer , it was broken from day one .
told me they would replace it with the exact same model .
awful service on so many levels .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
wrong dishwasher delivered the first time .
no note , no knock on the door .
i would not use my time like this .
i was very disappointed in their service .
washer wo n't drain .
tells me it 's a plumbing problem not the washer .
only charged me $ _num_ .
unfortunately , found his number this morning .
this is n't the worse place i 've been .
i should have walked out the moment i walked in .
it was awful .
words could not even express how angry i was after i left this place .
i look over at jill while i am waiting and she is in pain .
she is not enjoying this one bit .
now ... not to be disgusting , but my feet get dry .
no word on charging me ... but what should i expect ?
she had no tlc in her what 's so ever .
no need to remind me on how my feet are .
no lady , you did n't give .
to start we were instantly greeted and the place looked clean .
she was rough and rushed the whole time .
meanwhile another customer came in , she waited , but was obviously impatient .
this place is one of the worst nail salons i have been to .
horrible color selection , rude staff and plain and simple junk job .
not to mention they changed the prices last minute .
dont waste your time or money on this dump .
horrible .
horrible .
horrible .
my tech clearly could not understand much english .
she said , `` ok , five dollar off . ''
so i handed over $ _num_ .
she said , rudely , `` no !
extra for taking off your old polish ! ''
i would never return , obviously .
that 's a pitiful way to run a business .
i noticed that my _num_ min wait had become _num_ or _num_ min .
last time she made me wait an hour and a half .
my polish stopped lasting as long , and it often looked sloppy .
what a horrible experience !
i will never go back .
i ran to walgreens next door to get some cash .
everyone else is rude and too fast when they do your nails .
the owner wendy is completely rude and treats you like crap .
she is a horrible business owner .
i would suggest to try another nail salon !
i honestly wish i could give _num_ stars !
this place was horrible .
what in the flying f ?
i did n't even get my nails painted there .
you have seriously been warned !
would not recommend .
this is the worst place i have gone to get my nails done .
so she agree to give me a `` $ _num_ discount '' .
this nail shop is horrible .
i went to pay with my card biggest mistake ever .
in the end this is the most unprofessional company i have ever been to .
this place does ok work and is a rip off .
i would advise and really investigate their prices before you sit down .
i 'm very unhappy about it .
you will not see me going there again .
worst pedicure i 've ever gotten .
i was , literally , in and out in _num_ minutes .
my nail tech did n't even bother to put _num_ coats of polish on .
and $ _num_ for a freakin pedicure ?
the second time i brought a girlfriend in they were pretty bad .
if you 're considering this place , i 'd suggest going somewhere else !
yes it may be cheaper but the atmosphere and rudeness is not worth it .
bye bye wendy 's nails , your business attitude has lost our business .
very rushed job .
they just want to get you in and out .
take your money elsewhere .
was not impressed with this place at all .
when i walked in i was greeted by a full wall of products .
just this huge wall of products .
she was perfectly nice and polite , but it was just awkward .
the place is a cluttered mess .
i could n't believe it .
it was gross .
and it was n't even `` dentist 's office '' bad .
it was worse than what you 'd hear at applebee 's .
there were a lot of staff standing around still , too .
there is nothing soothing about this salon .
instead , i paid $ _num_ after tip for my mani/pedi .
after the reviews i read , i was expecting a really upscale salon .
i tried to book my appointment with bobby , but he was on vacation .
i was very dissapointed .
when i spend that much money on a salon visit .
i will not be returning to the salon .
i left the salon with almost black hair .
what a waste of $ _num_ and a few hours .
thanks for nothing .
avoid this place !
instead was a mess .
furthermore my hair was not even styled properly !
never had this happen before .
avoid this place .
the front desk 's customer service left a little to be desired as well .
2nd , no refund or potential fix .
my first mistake .
if my hair was so damaged , why would you try to do it ?
to add insult to injury , my haircut is horrible !
the worst $ _num_ i have ever spent !
service was done , price was ok .
crooks and i 'm never going back .
the box he was in was very tacky .
if i had my choice of a hospitals i would not have come here .
there was blood on the bath room door and walls of my patient bathroom .
staff did not address this issue and did not even seem to care !
i do not recommend this hospital , perhaps banner may be a better choice .
my husband and i arrived there at 7:30 pm last evening .
this is where things went downhill .
she placed us in another waiting room .
unfortunately , we thought wrong !
room by 11:00 pm , we were leaving as well .
thirty one minutes later , i was taken back to a room .
i was there in june _num_ .
wrong !
my last nurse was horrible !
i do n't know how she made me feel like i should apologize .
why should i feel guilty asking for things as a patient ?
i have never been treated this way before .
this was the worst hospital experience i have ever had .
my daughters hand was sliced open and wrapped in paper towels .
she was in pain .
my daughter is _num_ and knows pain .
it was awful .
went in at 4:30 , got out at 11:30 .
it was left near toilet did n't want to accidentally touch it !
if i could give this company no stars i would have .
sometimes you do n't even get that .
terrible communication , wo n't return calls or emails .
i wish we used another company , this one is pretty much worthless .
back in _num_ now time has been harsh to this place .
the food here too lacked any unique presentation or flavor .
i have never been treated so rudely .
they do n't care if they ruin your clothes .
so much so , that i left and went to my old cleaner .
they ruined an expensive jacket and refused to take responsibility for it .
avoid .
my garage door opener died a few weeks ago .
then died again .
it broke down _num_ days later , same issue .
called for a 3rd time and was told a tech was coming .
but geez ... horrible customer service .
note : my home warranty company chose this company .
they completely mess up , then send someone else back to fix the problem .
the tech was aggressive , & refused to wait .
about a minute later the tech knocked loudly on my inner garage door .
good thing i did n't have to shoot him .
my experience on the phone with them was n't so great either .
they completely mess up , then send someone else back to fix the problem .
the tech was aggressive , & refused to wait .
about a minute later the tech knocked loudly on my inner garage door .
good thing i did n't have to shoot him .
my experience on the phone with them was n't so great either .
poor customer service .
no call .
that was _num_ days ago !
and the garage door sounded like hell a few weeks later .
how they are in business i have no idea .
do not use this company !
the garage door , itself , worked just fine using the wall opener .
there were n't any other problems with my door .
i 'm only giving one star because zero stars are not an option .
a major disappointment !
pretty blah , really .
it 's fast food but with sit down prices and barely fast food taste .
not horrible , but also not worth the price .
the combos are $ _num_ and drinks are extra ( $ _num_ ) .
the shredded beef did n't have much flavor to it .
nothing special about the decoration .
kind of plain could of used some cleaning .
we get our drinks and wait and wait .
our drinks are empty and i have to ask to get refills .
later our waitress came out and said our food was being made .
this is your typical mom and pop place .
not so with this one .
we walked in and were seated promptly .
hard , greasy , horrible .
it was the worst cheese crisp i 've ever had .
the machaca burrito was made using ground beef with spices .
not your typical machaca .
i would not visit here again .
do not eat at this restaurant .
the mild salsa just tasted like cilantro .
the green corn tamale with green sauce was awesome !
this place was the worst mexican food restaurant that i have ever been !
i ordered a chimichanga enchilada style and it was terrible .
the refried beans were n't fresh at all .
both of our meals came out to be $ _num_ with only drinking water .
so not worth the price we paid for this food .
there was hardly any meat at all and it was flavorless .
the meal was n't cooked properly and the tortilla was still soft and chewy .
really would n't recommend this spot at all .
the waiter ( new ) did n't have a clue .
not this time .
prices were higher than i would expect for a hole in the wall place .
it seems to cater more to the neighborhood regulars than anyone else .
not bad , not good , just average .
worse mexican food i 've ever had !
horrible .
if you 're planning on coming in for breakfast , do n't .
$ _num_ for a tiny burrito .
chips and salsa what mexican restaurant charges for that ?
food was ok but not worth going back .
the customer rep was extremely rude and condescending with me .
we saw bugs _num_ weeks later and are shopping for a new company .
whatever they 're doing just is n't effective .
no more .
at least they are cheap , and you get what you pay for .
i would not recommend at all !
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
worst customer service !
in all , do not use this service !
i wish there was a `` _num_ star '' choice for this place .
we 'll see what happens : / i 'm not holding my breath .
worst experience i have ever had with a business in general .
all this information would have been great weeks ago .
she just stared at me .
well , i was dancing she just watched ( she was super shy ) .
my home warranty company assigned them to look into my a/c issues .
8:00 am friday morning and i have n't heard from anyone .
they gave me a window from _num_ am - _num_ pm .
easily the worst customer service experience of my life .
my home warranty company sent them out .
the cherry on top of the sundae is their f rating from the bbb .
finally a new tech from another az company realized it was installed wrong .
i 'm not sure they know what they are doing .
lazy , crooked and awful .
never again will i use this place .
the contractor then denied causing the damage .
it 's tuesday and - nothing .
needless to say , i 'm contacting another company .
do n't give them your money .
this is really an incompetent company .
really think twice before using this company .
plus their service is terrible .
owner is very unprofessional and does n't care about his customers .
yet another reason this shop is very bad .
i said no i do n't have cash .
and that has nothing to do with the repairs we already did .
do not use this location !
too bad their work is not consistent .
do n't go here .
after many more miles put in we called them dropped it off on monday .
horrible customer service !
the toilet was not seated properly , because they did not level the floor .
what a mistake , please do not make this one when you remodel .
be sure to check out bbb before you hire this guy for any job .
i want to stress here though that the management is terrible .
it 's extremely unfortunate and i wish it were n't so .
not a lot of integrity .
why ca n't the attendant understand a simple direct question ?
and worst of all ... my balls do n't fit in this place .
this has got to be the worst streets of ny in town .
i feel sick just thinking about what i just ate .
bad service .
out of wings ... really ?
cold pizza & flat soda .
dirty bathrooms with bugs all over the floors .
i sent my food back and did n't eat a thing .
very disappointed and unhappy .
these guys are a mess .
the unpleasant young woman at the counter had no record of the order .
he shook his head and came out with a lukewarm box .
nothing special .
and maybe the pizza would have been hot .
she said she would cancel and refund the order .
i then asked nicely , `` no apology or anything ? ''
not sure how the food is , but the service is lackluster .
placed a order for delivery tonight , i had guest over .
the street fries were the worst , rubbery and stale .
while my delivery showed up on time , my order was wrong .
the experience was disappointing .
i 've tried ordering _num_ times now and the pizza never comes out good .
i could tell she was young but hats no excuse .
the girl who took the order totally go it wrong !
i got ta say , i had a less than desirable experience tonight .
the spaghetti was beyond overcooked .
it just turned to mush .
the sauce , left a lot to be desired .
it was watery and bland and had very little meat .
they advertise italian sausage pieces in it .
the garlic bread was n't even toasted , and was soggy and terrible tasting .
worst $ _num_ i 've spent in a long time .
they got the order wrong .
then they overcharged me .
wo n't go back .
i am very disappointed .
i would not go back to this shop .
went to central care care for a diagnostic .
i would not trust them with my bicycle .
i will never return here .
they have spa chairs for pedicures .
he said `` no , you no need appointment , just come in . ''
got a full set today and they look so bad .
the polish is sloppy .
they do n't look neat and clean .
i could not wait so i rescheduled the appointment .
i replied no and i left the salon .
i will not be returning .
they are not running a professional business .
i said no i am on lunch , that 's why i called .
so rude .
on a day i was pressed for time , i made an appointment .
i will not be returning .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
she said she could not say and she would tell me by the register .
this is a cheap part and _num_ min of labor according to the dealer .
horrible horrible customer service and work .
horrible horrible customer service and work .
also had a hard starting problem when warm and slow power windows .
i know a lot about cars but was getting lazy about my own repairs .
looks like i 'm back to fixing it myself .
i would avoid them at all costs .
i live here .
the sewer pipes in the park are old and are being replaced through out .
basically anything goes if you do n't like it your told to move .
the park is very pro smoking and pets .
the canned foods in the grocery area are dusty .
also , the prices randomly change based on who is ringing you up .
but certainly never go out of your way to eat here .
how they have been in business this long is beyond me .
i 'm italian and i 'm embarrassed for these people .
i 'm so mad they have $ _num_ of my money .
but instead i feel ripped off .
what a disgrace to italian food .
as a 30+ year customer that is originally from brooklyn , i was appalled .
i also purchased a small jar of pesto recommended by the owner .
i opened it just to put on my pasta because it had no flavor .
perhaps next time i should get a sub .
the pesto was tossed out after the weekend ... _num_ percent full .
italian hero was decent but probably would n't come back for it .
no bueno .
not that impressed .
ok , i guess , but what if every service based business did that ?
then things got worse .
_num_ .
real harsh and angry .
probably not the best choice for any business .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
they iron your shirt from wet to dry .
no dryer .
second time experience ( only the second time ) , horrible .
they told me they did not have my clothes .
not only that but her attitude , tone , and words were absolutely horrible !
she would not even give us a name .
real harsh and angry .
probably not the best choice for any business . ''
well it went downhill from there .
glad i know now over a skirt instead of a $ _num_ business suit .
i am out and will never ever do business there again .
shes the worst and made me want to have a panic attack .
really , really , really , bad ... gross and dirty .
dryers did not dry .
just disgusting .
not going back .
this shop seemed like a nice find but i had a bad experience .
i walked in and was greeted as i walked back to the boots area .
there was already someone being service and i looked around waiting my turn .
after about _num_ mins i walked out .
there are better stores .
half of them are n't labeled or priced .
the same flowers were _num_ times the price than home depot .
i decided i was n't willing to pay nursery prices and left empty handed .
warning do not go here !
( edit : apple tree died . )
however , the tree lost nearly all its leaves within a couple weeks .
no call back .
called again to check ; no call back .
called to complain -- no call back .
that 's weird , how does a giant tree go missing ?
well , no one knows -- it just is .
store was old ...
i should give negative stars !
went in for an oil change and trip check friday april _num_ , _num_ .
my oil plug was n't put back in properly .
my car leaked all the oil .
we cant even register an oil reading .
completely ruined this trip !
shame on you guys !
( hey , your not going to be a customer anymore anyway ) .
hence the good reviews
all of my dog 's tests came back negative .
he said no , that it would just make things worse .
receptionist was very rude and i would never take my pet here !
long story short , i felt ripped off .
this place is horrible !
i was freaking out and it just did n't seem right .
they were very impersonal and all they cared about was my money .
if i 'm not comfortable there must be a reason .
this place is horrible !
i so wish i would have read yelp before taking my dog here .
they are horrible !
the tech was awful .
it appeared as though she has no idea what she was doing .
the tech said it was going to be _num_ .
so insulting !
horrible hospital , very impersonal !
the doctor only cares about money and is rude !
if you do n't like your job , get another one !
horrible veterinarian .
told us our dog had cancer and needed to operate quickly .
i have been taking my dog there for almost _num_ years .
quoted _num_ price for medication and then told a higher cost later .
this sucks .
seems like there were many older ladies browsing through the clothing racks .
never had signs , they would just come up and tell you .
you do not call your customers liars !
so disappointed .
do your store a favor and get rid of that terrible lady .
customer service leaves much to be desired .
no such luck .
the tvs were big and plentiful , the food was fair .
it was disgusting .
had a really bad experience .
without a doubt the rudest wait staff i have ever been around .
skip this place !
boy was i wrong !
probably wo n't be going back for a while if at all .
what a horrible experience !
they are overly disorganized .
!
i do not know many people who would consider this a staple .
the food is bland .
horrible food choices besides the salads .
lets just say the ingredients in all their foods are lacking significantly .
but nothing to note that will turn heads , just average .
there is no atmosphere really .
the food is mediocre at best .
the vibe is lame .
boneless wings are delicious however does not make up for the crappy service .
waitress was unfriendly and too busy .
i wo n't be back .
the food is poorly prepared , over cooked and hard fried .
the prices are n't that great .
there are plenty of better establishments for drinks and appetizers .
normally i love this place but today management failed .
they were understaffed to a criminal degree which is bad for employees and patrons .
went here tonight , will never be back .
but the service was beyond bad .
just an obvious example of poor training and poor management .
ridiculous .
it is too bad that there are no zero stars options .
the server repeatedly forgot my tables drinks .
just terrible and i could on but i 'll spare you .
we sat down and waited forever , no one even addressed us .
i was craving wings .
sat down greeted by the bartender .
he said nothing to us .
but went around to all other tables .
never had the opportunity to tell anyone since we were ignored .
so i walked out .
this has happened on more than one occasion .
do n't care to ever come back .
so were my friends ' sloppy nachos and quesadilla .
we made a mistake going there .
the food was not good and wife felt sick next day .
very bland boneless wings that were small pieces and no flavor .
the lettuce was terrible .
limp is one way to describe it .
beer cold .
very rude !
really disappointed .
the bartender was very inattentive and rude .
not sure why , as it took forever for meal to arrive .
good place for a beer , skip the food .
the place was dark and pretty much empty .
the cheese dip was horrible !
it was thick and cold .
the burgers were huge but not that great .
we did n't even finish the burgers cause they were just okay .
my husband then asks for fried fish .
she brings it out and it is way over cooked and dry .
he did n't finish it .
she gave us _num_ oz drinks to go and we left .
Neutral
frankly , i 'd give negative stars if i could !
they tired to get away with not doing the work i actually paid for .
before writing this , i had it all planned out in my head .
the spring rolls have the texture of dried cardboard .
moist cardboard would be an improvement .
not great but i ate it .
this was incredibly greasy , and the flavors were drowned out by the oil .
only white rice was offered with the orange chicken .
i did n't really like anything i ordered .
frankly , i was just really unimpressed .
i wo n't be back .
ugh .
ugh ugh ugh .
she ordered sweet and sour chicken and i ordered beef chow mein .
we 're not coming back .
Negative
too bad that my first review on yelp is a negative one : ( .
i was totally unsatisfied .
i can say i was sorely disappointed .
extremely bland american chinese food , without much authentic fare .
entres lack flavor and are very oily .
i would recommend driving out to chandler over dining here though .
i 've never had fried rice with this much oil !
husband and i went tonight .
water does n't taste very good .
not enough veggies or peanuts ( which seemed kind of stale ) .
chicken in both dishes , for me , was stringy chewy .
wo n't be back .
they started vacuuming by 9:30 and putting up chairs on tables .
unfortunately both meals we ordered were barely edible .
the crispy duck was mostly fat and lacked flavor .
i keep looking for decent pizza that is more accessible and less expensive .
second disappointment - the pizza .
ordered a large with ground sausage , mushrooms and black olives .
third disappointment - the salad .
i hate giving bad reviews .
actually this is the lowest review i 've ever given .
straight to the garbage and off to buy dinner for the second time tonight .
very poor customer service skills .
they did n't even apologize .
overpriced for such bad service .
the whole experience was pathetic and disappointing .
the driver showed up at the two hour mark with our pizza .
the pizza was okay , but would not order again because of the service .
the roast beef last time tasted like it came from subway .
gross !
employees lack personality .
supposed to get _num_ wings and they only sent _num_ .
never ordering delivery again , and probably wo n't be eating there either .
no stars !
she said no , none of the dressings have oregano .
she said yes , and there was oregano in the dressing as well .
no apologies , no concern ... nothing .
wo n't be going back .
_num_ minutes past the suggested arrival time , still no pizza and wings .
she was not a good example of customer service .
so no one to talk to .
i am not sure if i will give them another shot .
i feel really let down , compared to the past experiences .
sorry ... but my kids would n't even eat this pizza .
it was terrible .
slow slow slow .
then it was another _num_ minutes to change our oil .
always try to up sell you unnecessary services and products using fear tactics .
one fell out in a parking lot and was luckily found .
not impressed .
manager pulled out the engine air filter from the trash .
i did n't feel like a valued customer .
company that takes five men for a simple oil change .
also , they tried pushing everything under the sun ... .
i will not be coming back .
$ _num_ later .
i hate liars and incompetent management .
( this explained no cars in the lot ) .
the choices are limited and not that good .
i waited for _num_ minutes .
no waiter .
_num_ minutes later no omelette .
finally flagged the waitress down an said i had to leave .
three minutes later , still no waitress .
no box .
i walked out hungry .
went back for lunch .
it was a big mistake .
not once did my water get refilled .
no one asked me how my lunch was .
i 'm never coming back .
i wish i could give it _num_ stars .
the whole tab was like $ _num_ for the worst breakfast this summer .
not even _num_ star !
said nothing but the total , handed me the change and receipt .
i stayed here last month .
disgusting .
she did n't tell any of them .
i recently booked this hotel by the pictures .
as for the hotel it was very dumpy and dirty .
not kept up at all .
the pictures do not tell the full story .
lumpy pillows with questionable bedding .
bad coffee and terrible breakfast .
the non smoking room smelled like a smoking room .
i would avoid this place at all costs .
room _num_ is a nightmare room , do not stay there .
stayed with family of four for _num_ days .
had to go run down to the front desk for towels all the time .
worst experience ever .
i wish i could say that this was the worst part .
needless to say , i will never stay here again .
the rooms were clearly updated but were still somewhat gross and musty inside .
needed _num_ beds to sleep _num_ people .
this is extremely disappointing .
do n't stay here if you can help it .
they gave away our room .
no extra blankets .
of course , the room reeked .
clearly management does not care about future stays , as i will not return .
of course , the room reeked .
clearly management does not care about future stays , as i will not return .
which is very offensive considering the work they do for animals .
i am preparing to travel with small dog and need pricing for health certificate .
i have them such a glowing review before .
i am really disappointed .
there are so many competitors and the economy is not great right now .
companies can not afford to have the worst customer service .
they were quite helpful .
open road tours nearly ruined our vacation !
poor service too , especially since there were only _num_ tables of patrons .
as you can see , i have eaten at bc many many times .
very plain , nothing special .
this place has to be some of the worst chinese food in my life .
seriously , i am wondering if it is some kind of joke .
i ordered vegetarian spring rolls , and a green vegetable stir fry .
i did not intend to order fried , greasy mess rolls .
this place definitely needs a health inspection , and probably needs to be closed .
needless to say , i will not be ordering from bamboo china again .
i read the review but sorry the food was nasty .
i ended up throwing my food away .
very disappointing all the way around .
they had zero people in the audience , except other acts for the night .
so so much potential but poorly done .
had to have them back and then they still did n't get things clean .
at 12:30 i get a message asking me if they could start at 2:00 .
total disregard for client 's time .
terrible as most said something changed .
they hire people as needed with no experience with window cleaning .
stay away and do n't waste your money .
that 's when they decided to tell me about the warranty .
run from the place unless you do n't care about your money .
call again at noon , and they tell me _num_ .
however that should n't take an additional _num_ hours to finish mine up .
thanks but no thanks .
this typically fixed me up within a week or so .
in any case , i decided moon valley chiropractic is no longer for me .
in fact finding a king sheet set anywhere was rough .
however there really was n't anyone else around to help me find anything .
big kia on bell road is a total rip-off !
a total joke !
after that everything goes downhill .
i did not have a good experience at big bell kia .
after that the owner got really nasty .
it was n't anywhere to be found .
when tony finally was available we walked around and still could n't find it .
all new staff and no records from the previous owners .
i will not be returning .
i went in there , as a first time customer .
what a pain in the butt to get a refund !
i feel like i need a pedicure after the crap they gave me .
super pushy , not kind at all .
ugh .
when i walked in , i did n't get a warm welcome .
my toe nails were filed incorrectly .
very weak massage .
not very friendly .
sucked so bad !
# very unfriendly as i will never return again # !
worst customer service ever !
the women were extremely rude , i will never go back to this place .
the wax itself was awful .
what a waste of time , money and hair !
not very coupon friendly .
we will never return to this walgreens .
pharmacy is terrible .
the are slow and disorganized with poor customer service .
i use them rarely , but each time has been a terrible experience .
never had any problems .
is by far the worst i 've ever been too .
same insurance , little did we know our insurance card had changed .
`` told him i have already called your corporate office .
i give this pharmacy the worst ratings .
no customer service .
he did n't help us .
he too was in pain .
do n't go to this pharmacy .
a total of _num_ hrs waiting .
never got the medicine my husband needed .
unless you want to be disappointed .
run away from the most incompetent excuse for a pharmacy and staff imaginable .
we arrived at this walgreens before _num_ pm on may _num_ , _num_ .
we were told a _num_ minute wait and our prescriptions would be ready .
the pharmacist and the tech both ignored my existence .
after _num_ minutes , someone acknowledged me .
then stared at me like i was an idiot .
i asked her for my prescription back ... they had lost it .
i called another walgreens to see if they had the prescription in stock .
we went to drop off prescriptions ( _num_ ) for both my children .
read the reviews you idiots .
_num_ minutes and i 'm walking out the front door .
would rate zero if i could .
the staff at this pharmacy are extremely curt , arrogant and extremely condescending .
avoid this location at all costs .
worst pharmacy experience ever .
i figured it was the same and i 'd have no problems .
well it 's clear i was wrong .
my partner and i have had nothing but problems .
we have been having nothing but headaches from this pharmacy .
the pharmacy techs are extremely rude and not willing to help .
they just act like i 'm some crazy person .
i ca n't even get my medication because they are not doing their job .
they claimed they never received it .
there always seems to be an issue with every single customer .
this is a mickey mouse club house in here .
during the day , _num_ stars .
you will wait at least an hour , even if your prescription is ready !
thats , right , _num_ minutes for _num_ pills .
he had never had an issue before .
he went down the street to cvs ... much better pharmacy services there .
what sucks about this particular store is the pharmacy .
6:30 rolls around no text , called in to automated system still not ready .
i wait til 8pm , same thing smh .
worst photo department i have ever seen .
okay fine , help the old man first , whatever .
pain in the ass , they are closed for _num_ weeks .
i quickly jumped on that deal .
its very dirty and not well organized .
highly disappointed .
salty and not spicy at all .
fried wontons i could n't even chew .
the lettuce wraps were ok ... little bland .
only good thing that we ate all of was the hot and sour soup .
everything else we sadly threw away .
the service was great but the food was disappointing .
the crispy duck was aweful dry and all bones chopped up with little meat .
the plum sauce was not helping .
i should of listened to my fiance when he said this place was horrible .
yuck never again .
it was awful .
the sauce did not come on the chicken and the chicken was extremely dry .
we could n't eat any of it .
total waste of money .
i 'm sorry but this place was awful .
$ _num_ bucks later we left disappointed and disgusted .
literally wish i went to sleep for the night instead .
we ordered delivery from this place tonight and it was pretty awful .
the delivery driver was super nice , but it was all downhill from there .
according to my bf the hot and sour soup was great .
however , the entrees were really terrible .
way overcooked , rubbery nuggets of chewy dried out chicken .
i ate about three small bites and gave up .
and i 've eaten a lot of bad general tso 's chicken .
the chow mein was edible but not what i would call good .
it was almost flavorless .
mediocre would be the apt word to describe food at flamingo palace .
this place should be avoided at all costs .
why ca n't i just order what i want ?
why ca n't you just sell a half bowl ?
we ordered takeout from flamingo palace last night and it was n't very good .
the broccoli beef smelled funny to me so i did n't try it .
the sesame chicken was ok , but did n't stand out .
neither did the general tso chicken .
egg rolls were good though .
do not order delivery from this place !
total was supposed to be around $ _num_ , but jumped to $ _num_ .
sadly , we probably wont go back .
my friend and i went for lunch , the costumer service was terrible .
i do n't know why she 's even in costumer service !
i would never go back .
the chicken was very bland , and it was indicated as a spicy item ?
the chicken was supposed to be deep fried and covered in sauce .
however it was soggy and not crispy what so ever .
only giving one star cause i had to .
the fried shrimp was so gross , just fried greasy batter .
but they seem to have closed .
probably wo n't be back .
it was dry , overcooked pieces of duck with bones in it .
it comes with dipping sauce on the side which was also gross .
seriously terrible .
he also hated this .
not going back .
tried to order twice from here cause i liked what .
but they seem to have closed .
tried to order from here again tonight .
waited _num_ hours and no food .
he told me no because he didnt know or trust me .
i find that pretty ridiculous and bad customer service .
it was average at best .
if i could give it a zero i would .
this last experience at this arby 's turned my stomach .
to bad , only fast food i ever ate .
i did n't feel rushed at all .
i would never go back to this place .
worse manicure i 've got in _num_ years .
my biggest gripe with sports pepper is that the food quality is very inconsistent .
the side salad was horrible .
i answer : `` use old wilted and brown iceberg lettuce . ''
i mean this stuff should have been thrown out last week .
the buffalo shrimp and fajitas are awesome .
dive does not even begin to cover how bad this place was .
the service was very slow even though we were the only ones there .
hoping to save this terrible lunch trip we still ordered them .
the wings were not hot at all .
it was a dump and smelled like one and the food was terrible .
not a good start .
no noticeable spice .
the service was n't bad but was n't impressive either .
it 's unfortunate .
our group also experienced the sewage odor that was noted by previous reviewers .
no big deal .
reality is , that 's not the case .
it 's probably the easiest thing to change on the car .
i ca n't wait for my lease to end .
the maintenance is quick and responsive , have always fixed things and quickly .
rent is decently priced .
more trashy people than great families .
that was a little annoying .
honestly , i could bare with the other cons except this ... its awful .
even the fountain out by the mail boxes is broken at the top .
there has been over _num_ calls for police emergency service to this apartment complex .
the other day , my neighbors car was broken into .
the complex is loud , kind of dirty , and generally feels unsafe .
there is trash all over the place .
the worst company !
horrible customer service ... ... ... highly recommend not to use !
it was terrible in the worst way .
the soda system was having a problem and did not taste right .
did they tell customers , no .
wow , poor customer service all around .
went to get my jeans altered .
will not go back .
i have been going to phoenix alteration for _num_ years .
becky was the original owner but has sold the business .
i will not be going back .
unfortunately that was not my experience .
i refused to pay as i agreed to the set price .
i will not be returning to phoenix alterations .
by far the worst customer service ever !
how dishonest !
food is gross looking , and taste is not far behind .
the lady that owns it is rude and makes the owner workers miserable .
two they try to scam you for more money like not taking online coupons .
the place is n't that bad food wise but the people suck .
i kinda wish i stopped somewhere else .
all were dry and flavorless except for the sugar .
i was so disappointed in this .
the shelves were pretty empty .
they office staff has a ridiculous turn over .
never again will i rent from this place or their properties .
so all in all , do not rent here .
the front gate often times is just broken and left open .
this is literally the worst apartment i 've ever lived in .
i have never met a apartment staff so rude .
they then were sending me to collections .
what was worse , i was told i was paying for a quality installer .
manager was busy chatting with employees .
1st rule in retail business : customer satisfaction comes first .
reason why i hate writing bad reviews , well they have some great employees .
very helpful guys like craig , paul , chuck and few others .
in store is hit and miss .
i was with my fianc and could n't believe it .
these guys obviously hate their jobs or need a vacation .
how can a big store like hire old grumpy jerks !
i hate paying full price for anything .
but i do n't like to feel dirty when i leave a store .
i felt really , really dirty when i left this store .
this is a yucky ross .
dirty , dirty , dirty !
the trip was a waste of an hour that i 'll never get back .
worst return policy in town !
the cashier was trying to be friendly and ask how my day was .
went here to some good socks and man this store was bad .
they made the trip even worse !
they were loud and obnoxious to all other shoppers .
the employees are rude , the selection is terrible and the store is dirty .
horrible horrible customer service !
there were absolutely no washing instructions that said do not dry !
so i guess i just through my money down the drain .
they are also selling prom dresses ( one for $ _num_ ! )
this is the worst manicure i 've ever had in my life !
disgusting !
i will never return here again .
terrible experience !
sorry to say but my experience was n't the greatest .
i went here once and never going back .
the things i was most disappointed in was the manicure .
i felt rushed as well only _num_ staff and _num_ customers .
they were super thin .
looks like i did my manicure myself .
but i was so wrong .
it 's ridiculous .
we had a really bad experience .
i would not recommend her .
i would give the place itself _num_ stars , very kid friendly .
she is the only reason i gave it _num_ star .
she was extremely rude to him and handled him roughly .
she said that that 's the only way to handle his curly hair .
she refused again .
but feel their skill level is poor .
would rather go elsewhere .
it was like no other wonton soup i have ever seen .
i will not make this mistake twice .
f these idiots .
one has to wonder why they want children behind closed doors separated from parents .
they only care about money and not the care of their patients .
scam , scam .
go to bbb report before go to him please .
person like him ca n't be in us .
got f rate very bad .
none of the changes are good and i 'll keep it brief .
for whatever reason , this facility charges a court fee .
most phoenix tennis courts do not .
never seen that before !
there are better courts to be had , especially for the money .
customer beware , nothing feel worse than food poisoning .
this is not just upset stomach , it is full on horrible .
the onion rings we were served were sour !
terrible location that should be shut down .
this is my third visit and my last .
the drive through is always slow .
at _num_ mins tried again .
so off to wendy 's across the street .
so very unlike the horrid sonic that we will never return to .
how does one mess up cheese fries ?
they did it _num_ times and thats not all they messed up .
waited in the drive thru for _num_ minutes for _num_ order of tater tots .
we ordered _num_ number _num_ meals .
massive rip off .
wish we had seen it all and not wasted $ _num_ .
stopped for breakfast while my wife was in the hospital .
worst breakfast burrito and coffee i 've ever had .
threw it in the trash and left .
horrible .
i 'm disappointed nearly every time i go here .
store is just too small .
variety sucks , prices suck .
not good .
ick !
i 'm the duke of one of the worst safeway 's in town ?
speed , no self check out and there are only few lanes .
then she walked away for something .
gross and bland .
mediocre thai food .
maybe i just ordered the wrong dish .
the decor is definitely nothing to speak of , but it was clean .
unfortunately we were seated in an odd area in the back of the restaurant .
anyway , we went on to order and started off with an appetizer .
the tortilla was folded in half and then cut into four pieces .
for entrees , i ordered pad see ew and my bf ordered pad thai .
but it was n't served like that .
in my experience , pad see ew is n't supposed to be spicy .
i think it was either old or just a very poor cut of meat .
now here 's why i ended up giving only two stars .
they are rude every single time .
there 's a bk and a mcdonalds down the street .
not at this location .
it 's wendy 's gross !
service was friendly .
tasted like it had been sitting for awhile .
Negative
i wish that i could give negative stars for this place .
i went inside to get it fixed , and they forgot about me .
i waited _num_ minutes and they tried to charge me again .
it was really slow .
they gave me my burger without cheese and with onions .
the cheese was n't even melted , and i hate the taste of onions .
they seriously make me sick .
they have no idea what customer service is whatsoever .
the people who work there can not tell a chicken sandwich from a burger .
this place will mess up your order every time .
avoid this wendy 's location whenever possible i wish i could leave zero stars .
i got _num_ crispy chicken sandwiches , _num_ piece nugget , and a tea .
like it had been sitting out for a long time .
selling old food is not good for business .
the store near bell and 7th st. was filthy .
great pizza and wings but some of the employees are rude .
worse `` ray 's '' i 've been too !
worst pizza ever !
it was just sauce and little but of cheese .
horrible food !
( review for by the slice ) thin and soggy .
too bad , because the crust was excellent .
none were ready .
waited _num_ minutes and then got cold anchovies and sauce .
paid for ranch and got home and no ranch .
what a terrible experience for a well reviewed place .
not cool .
insulting and honestly ... .
service was neither friendly nor rude .
my brother and i thought the taste was _num_ out of _num_ .
price is a little expensive but they give you a lot of meat .
several hours after eating this pizza , i felt like crap .
the next day , i reheated the leftovers in a pizza stone .
and again , several hours after eating , feel like crap again .
i do n't like eating cheap food .
toppings had fallen to one side , leaving the other without and so expensive .
not worth it .
this is the worst cleaner i have ever been to !
the prices are not cheap enough to justify the horrible work they do !
this is a horrible excuse for a cleaners .
it also smells like i picked it up from a thrift store .
i 've had this cleaned twice before and never had an issue .
quick service , poor quality .
will not be back .
they are lucky leaving _num_ stars is not an option .
this place ruined my dry cleaning .
horrible !
the guy i dealt with seemed very lazy .
i could have done better to wash them myself and iron everything .
um no , i 'll try somewhere else and left .
what a disgusting little place .
i grabbed my stuff and left .
the place is more like a junk store than a reputable shoe repair .
if i could give a _num_ star , they 'd own it.
it was a mistake getting it from boa .
no questions ?
i have never been treated so poorly by an establishment in my entire life .
what they will do is force customers to other banks .
he instead insisted that i text his `` personal cell phone '' .
the customer service there is terrible .
horrible customer service .
so in the end it took _num_ minutes to get quarters .
i will have to remember to stop on my way home from work elsewhere .
not the type of service i would expect .
perhaps time to staff for these occasions if you know they will be busy .
the apartment is ok by my standards .
it is basic and ok for the price i suppose .
_num_ sq .
no one was ever friendly towards me .
i had loud , obnoxious residents around me .
it took _num_ weeks before anything happened .
that is just terrible service .
granted it is not all bad .
that or they think we 're too dumb to neatly do it ourselves .
i 'm glad i wo n't be here for much longer .
at this point , i do n't even expect to get my deposit back .
i was promised that it would get new carpet ... .
!
!
the management make it very difficult to live here .
i have n't met too many other residents that are happy living here .
instead , if you like this area , i would recommend the boulevard apartments .
Negative
this business makes me wish i could give negative stars .
Positive
i wish i could give negative stars .
apparently i am not .
insulting .
( yes , a kilt ) .
i did n't have to figure it out on my own .
how many of you can not pay your visa with your checking account ?
how the hell am i supposed to pay them ?
no answers .
what a mess .
they are not all about `` us '' .
however i would not recommend this credit union over most banks .
i get home and what do i find ?
my current bank has no such limit .
this is n't one of them .
i think they do well by their members but this particular situation was disappointing .
it 's something like _num_ days .
apology not accepted .
i 'm not kidding .
my husband waited another _num_ minutes before a technician even started with him .
_num_ minutes after our stated appointment time , i finally saw my technician .
the staff was apologetic about the timing , but first impressions are a killer .
i really do n't think we will be going back .
i have given this place multiple chances ... and every time i am disappointed .
i wo n't be going back ... .
went to this salon in october for a pedicure .
i would go elsewhere for the price .
i wo n't return to this location .
i waited more than _num_ minutes before getting my scheduled pedicure .
i thought that experience was bad but nothing compared to my brother 's .
i will never step foot in this place again .
the staff , and especially the receptionist , were so absolutely rude .
i was furious , especially since they only took fifteen dollars off the bill .
terrible !
her mouth remained stuck open and crooked with her tongue out .
no one returned my call .
so i made another follow-up two days later .
terrible !
i have had my apartment sprayed _num_ times to no avail .
one time there was no water for _num_ hours .
otherwise , they just head home and do n't worry about it .
i walk in and the woman at the counter says can i help you ?
i 'd not noticed that before , but why would i ?
no customer should ever be treated like this .
do n't waste your time on this one , like i did .
would n't even look at my item nor me .
just kept staring into space .
well i guess the customer service is still really bad .
the lady at the front is not helpful at all .
it appears there are new owners .
the buffet items are overly greasy and spiced oddly .
just stopped for lunch before driving off .
they had about _num_ vegetable dishes and _num_ chicken dishes .
probably wo n't ever go back .
i 'm hungry and craving some indian food , so i stop in .
granted , the place had n't just opened , it was after _num_ .
do n't go !
the tandoori chicken is the worst i have eaten in az .
really , it sucked .
i made the mistake of going here once for lunch .
the food was n't good and the service was bad .
they seemed to hate me for some reason .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
too much salt added to all the dishes we had .
the chicken masala was ok as well .
bet i 'm not the only person who is having a problem with this .
most unprofessional staff .
i would leave messages , wait days with no return calls .
like get off you butt and come look at your crew .
they should take the word luxury out of there description .
not a welcoming place .
_num_ stars from the vegan perspective .
maybe some whole wheat pasta too ?
custom made passion bread with no garlic butter or cheese .
we then made an olive oil + balsamic + oregano dip .
i 've been to ny and this is not ny style pizza .
regardless of that , it simply is n't good .
do not order the soup if you are on a low sodium diet .
i stopped to get two different kinds of wings .
this was disappointing .
the _num_ stars are for the disappointing wings .
they were really bad .
salad was good , the pizza was horrible .
the only reason we tried this establishment is because my wife wanted a salad .
this place is questionable at best .
my food was barely over room temp at best .
streets of new york pizza is awful .
they over charge and their ingredients are sub par .
save your money and do n't bother to get food there .
all it consists of is soggy tomatoes and cheese .
basically no basil to speak of and no `` splash of balsamic '' .
how can you charge these prices for such a pitiful product ?
we had a medium pizza , half new yorker and half veggie .
it was average at best .
if you 're looking for average at best , this is it .
not even close to a new york pizza by any standard .
avoid the regular ice tea , it 's olive flavored .
oh , lets not get to carried away here .
i had the rigatoni with smoked chicken in a parmesan cream sauce .
`` i dunno '' .
way over-priced !
this place is trying to be something it is not .
and seven dollars for mac-n-cheese , that is outrageous !
another reviewer described the decor as being in their grandparents house .
first off , `` joey 's california bistro italian restaurant '' ?
a waiter was screaming at a customer from the other side of the restaurant .
the bleu cheese dressing contained no actual cheese .
oh , and the shrimp was boiled .
rather than coming here , just eat the money .
i worried , because the food had n't arrived yet .
i 'd give him _num_ stars on personality if i could rate that here .
normally price is n't an issue if the food is worth it .
it 's pretty hard to mess up a pizza as simple as a margherita .
the pizza was very bland .
half the pizza was now sitting on the bar counter .
it was sub-par .
wow , this place is certainly empty for a reason !
too bad , i really wanted to like it .
this place was terrible .
my daughter ordered chicken fingers which were not that great .
i ordered shrimp alfredo and the shrimp and alfredo sauce were spoiled .
service was very slow and the food was not edible .
we have never sent food back , but tonight was the exception .
ca n't believe this place is still in business .
the place was empty ( that should have been our first clue ) .
all i remember is it was pretty expensive and it was n't even good .
place was empty on a thursday night .
gross !
what a mistake that was .
we walked in and the place was a complete hot and stuffy ghost town .
given the location and dcor , the prices were absolutely ridiculous .
i ordered the shrimp alfredo , she the eggplant parm .
this place needs a kitchen nightmares make over asap !
poor gal .
here 's one for you reading this ... do n't go !
i got a salad to go and was disappointed when i got home .
this salad was $ _num_ .
it tasted nice but was n't worth the money .
we had a family function here and i was sadly disappointed .
it was not worth the $ _num_ price for such an average meal .
he got three stuffed shells in a meat sauce .
but $ _num_ is ridiculous for such a mediocre meal .
the pizza was mediocre and service was strange to say the least .
probably wo n't go back .
wood fired pizza ?
my pizza was soggy and doughy .
the environment was awkward and weird .
many different servers and all were not very friendly -- just weird .
did not live up to the hype .
we ordered meat dumplings , orange chicken and garlic chicken .
i 'm sorry to say that i 'm not impressed with bamboo house .
the first time i visited , i ordered the eggplant with garlic sauce .
it was a little bit bland and rather greasy .
edible but not something i would order again .
however , the orange tofu was terrible .
the tofu was soggy ( bleh ! )
: ( i wo n't be going to bamboo house a third time .
i guess we must have ordered the wrong dishes because it was beyond awful .
tonight 's visit was unbelievably disgusting !
then the plates we received were dirty and had to be replaced as well .
i dislike drinking from cups at restaurants .
ask for crispy and get it so overcooked that it is chicken jerky .
then this is where it went south .
i 'm not joking .
so sad .
with that being said let 's start off on a positive note .
the rice , eggrolls , and fried wontons were equally disappointing .
( i 'm still not sure if it was chicken i was eating . )
i could n't even believe how night and day the food was .
the house chicken was over fried , greasy and rubbery .
not even edible , just disgusting .
the vegetables were n't even cooked , i 've never seen onions so raw .
the crab puffs were cold in the middle and undercooked .
my dad and i had takeout from this place last night .
he got the kung pao chicken and i had the house chicken .
sadly , it is not any longer .
my hot and sour soup tasted quite different from the way it had .
egg drop soup is watery no flavor .
egg rolls are greasy and over fried .
need to change no flavor like before very poor food quality .
i have been coming here off and on for years .
teriyaki was nasty .
food was a little bland .
i probably wo n't be going back .
i ordered $ _num_ worth of take-out and it did not feed three .
none of the containers were full .
this place used to be amazing , and now the food is just bland .
sorry to say , but yuck .
sad to see a good place go downhill .
unfortunately , wo n't be back here again .
he never went to wash his hands afterwards .
for the main course , we ordered some grilled veggie burritos enchilada style .
when they arrived , we were highly disappointed .
what part of `` grilled veggie burrito '' is supposed to have cold vegetables ?
i had the shrimp bowl which is apparently new to the menu .
now like i said i just wanted a little guac for my tacos .
which not to mention the guac is n't really all that great .
the tacos are good , the service is bad .
about _num_ minutes goes by and that same plate is still sitting up there .
okay now like i said before ... we ordered the exact same thing !
okay so then back to the guac ... .
i felt so hurt at all the effort we put in .
since then , i will not got back due to poor customer response .
i will not recommend this place to any of my friends .
also , power yoga should be taught by type a people .
her class was so bad that i barley broke into a sweat .
i will not be returning .
so i do n't know if it was the drink or the food .
i will not be going back to this place ever .
this was my second visit to this location .
and how did it end up _num_ $ ?
this time it was so bad i had to throw it out .
it just ruined it for future visits .
plus the 2am crowd is interesting !
been eating here a few months now and usually get the shredded beef tacos .
whatever it was it was disgusting .
then i tried some nachos , with the `` carne asada '' on it .
and those particular nachos were just as bad without the `` meat '' .
i asked for diced tomatoes and got two half tomatoes with cuts in them .
it 's ok.
the beans are a little runny .
not a fan .
my expectations are low .
despite this , peter piper pizza found a way to disappoint .
worse still , there was a very bitter aftertaste that made it inedible .
had this pizza at work and i have to say it was bad .
it was hard and pretty tasteless .
oh and the fries were cold both times .
neither one of us could continue ... .
god only knows what they could do to my food behind closed doors .
i am sorry .
you really let me down this past friday night .
the table in front and beside me also sent back food for various reasons .
me neither .
not sure where she was but we waited patiently .
this does not feel good when one is wearing shorts .
the menus were disgusting .
they were sticky , ripped , faded , food stuck on gross .
needless to say we actually walked out of the restaurant .
and it was $ _num_ !
the burgers are , like most places , served with french fries .
we want to get a pile of fries with our meal .
the restaurant was super loud and it was difficult to talk .
with beans and cheese on them ( sort of like mini cheese crisps ) .
the presentation was horrible , they tasted even worse .
i was brought a huge salad that looked awful and tasted worse .
just wilted lettuce and chicken ( that tasted like it was old ) .
i ate two bites and had had enough .
this was almost the worse dining experience ever !
$ _num_ for a awful appetizer and two entrees .
seriously what the hell happened to this location !
seriously idk how this guy did not here the two separate orders .
food was up to par today .
my last experience was mediocre and still decided to give this place another try .
we ended up with the same unfriendly and rude bartender .
worst dining experience ever .
wait staff had no idea what was going on .
server was trying her hardest but to no avail .
absolute disaster .
this chili 's is awful .
the service is ridiculous and the food is gross .
the food did not taste good at all .
the service was slow and rude .
just had lunch at chili 's and unfortunately it was a disaster .
the manager comp 'd the meal however that was it .
i would strongly advise not to eat here .
the chicken was rubber and had me question if was actually chicken .
i 'm not sure why i ate here it was my own fault .
why does anyone eat at these shitty places .
no service .
do n't plan on dining here again .
the people sitting behind me were moving and it was shaking my whole seat .
no acknowledgement .
this was not their best night .
the service was slow .
the food had rushed air to it .
stay away from saturday night .
terrible experience !
from the attitude of the hostess to the overcooked cheese fries twice .
hey atleast i didnt have to pay for the overcooked fries .
i out the pick up about _num_ minutes out from when i ordered it .
here i sit eating my lunch .
the keg blew so the young man went for another .
ok i get that you may not have ordered correctly or planned correctly .
instead you just ruined my sunday !
i 'm not paying for them i stated .
sad and unhappy .
do n't waste your time or money here unless lindsay is at the bar .
bad bad service .
everytime i give it another try i regret it .
not impressed .
lost my appetite and left .
it took another employee and customer to get him to stop trying to fight .
it made the atmosphere very uncomfortable we had to leave .
terrible .
wings arrived cold , spaghetti tasted like they opened a can of tomato paste .
french fried in old oil grease .
i wo n't be back .
this place has crappy customer service .
they forgot part of our order from tonight .
when we called to get it corrected the manager was rude and unhelpful .
this is a horrible pizza hut location .
should n't be a problem , right ?
a long time ago , i ordered their wings and they were mostly dry .
i called and spoke with an extremely unhelpful guy , he sounded young .
no phone call this time .
gross i will not be going there again .
this is the pizza hut on 7th st and union hills .
then i 'm talking to someone new .
adam said they canceled the order after i did n't pick up the phone .
you 're too lazy to leave a voicemail ?
shame on you pizza hut .
threw them both in the trash !
when they arrived , the driver neglected to bring us our pepsi .
wish i would have realized it before i left him a very generous tip .
and because of that mistake i will no longer order from this location .
the _num_ stars if for the delivery driver only .
i wish i had read this review before going there .
Negative
but , the pizza was a negative _num_ star .
_num_ minutes back to home .
pizza was very saucy , dripping of sauce , too much sauce .
wings box was smashed and food was room temperature at best .
unfortunately , i ca n't agree with the prior reviewers .
by lunch time , my daughter did not receive the flowers .
the arrangement of the flowers was very sloppy .
on closer examination , the flowers are all fake .
just had the most frustrating experience i have ever had at any shipping location .
all we wanted to do was ship a package from phoenix to chicago .
really , you ca n't search fedex locations from a fedex ?
per the fedex site we got a quote for $ _num_ using generous measurements .
and you do have to ask questions or you can be disappointed .
we were there _num_ minutes and finally left because we could n't get anywhere .
horrible , horrible service !
it came out $ _num_ less .
so , i said let 's just get it done .
i should have done this after they hired the new people .
well , fedex just lost all my business !
stop your conversation with each other or put down your iphone and say hi .
do n't just grab my keys and avoid eye contact with the members .
downside was offered a free hour of personal training when i signed up .
the big downside and reason i 'll never go there again .
sent it out and was still getting charged .
please , i repeat please do not bring your child here .
club had a great remodel .
but its going down hill really fast .
it was like trying to buy a used car .
i hate high pressure sales .
this gym has become an absolute dump .
the place is an absolute tip in the evenings .
i tried to do zero stars but it would n't let me .
so , this is two months i am getting overcharged .
it 's not up to you !
i 'm not under a contract .
you have my money and i 'm not giving you anymore .
so i called corporate who instantly canceled my membership .
my biggest problem with this gym is the hours .
they close at _num_ on sundays and _num_ fridays and saturdays .
the sales reps they call personal trainers are pushy and rude .
man , i hate this location !
this is the only la fitness i 've seen that does this .
# _num_ the hours suck .
they close at _num_ on friday and _num_ on saturday and sunday .
this is also the only on la fitness i 've seen do this .
apparently this location goes by it 's own rules which is it 's downfall .
hmmm ... seems like a rude response .
i ask for his manager , he smiles and says he 's the manager .
i want to pretend that i do n't need a fancy gym .
let me add a note that i have lost _num_ lbs on my own .
the cardio machines are n't new .
the weight machines are standard , at best .
do n't let them pressure you .
they always have deals that are better than what i got .
that broad needs a reality check !
it was over $ _num_ dollars !
this was n't a payment for back payments , or anything like that .
it was insane !
we have been trying to quit for _num_ weeks and it is not possible .
parent of the child entering the child care area .
the child care area and i followed .
child i saw the child was extremely terrified of him .
member present was a young girl not knowing what to do .
and no children in the child care .
child .
avoid this gym if you take your kids there .
i i signed up with a trainer back in february .
i gave it a shot and was not satisfied .
he is very quick to make promises with zero return .
it is clear that customer service is not his priority .
really need to teach the front desk ladies about customer service .
the gm greeted me , but looked and spoke only to my mom .
i had canceled my membership because i had lost my job .
disgusting .
ive been a member here about _num_ years and have been to different locations .
and many times in the morning the sauna is not been turned on .
avoid this place like the plague .
club culture here is hit or miss ... mostly miss .
people do n't use towels in the free weight or on the machines .
bathrooms cleanliness leave something to be desired .
this place has no customer service and it lacks in professionalism .
was n't a problem the day before .
however , that does not help when the place becomes over run with peeps .
the front desk girls are beyond rude .
i hate dealing with them .
i literally hate this place now .
completely ruined my hair today .
in the end , i could barely contain my tears .
it was friday and i never left my house out of sheer embarrassment .
i even called out of work for _num_ days due to the disaster .
what should have taken one day took _num_ .
i do not recommend this location for any of your technical needs .
it 's too bad they are n't any nicer to customers .
it 's always empty and their prices need to be more competitive .
ten minutes went by and i got tired of waiting and browsing .
office max , your level of customer service is unacceptable .
worst dry cleaning i 've ever had done .
completely disrespectful and a horrible way to run a business .
would not recommend this place to anybody .
no quality , no discounts and no more customer here .
could hardly understand them with their broken english .
they were very rude .
could n't have said it better .
i did n't find the employees friendly or helpful at all .
why not just go buy something new ?
no thanks nancy .
your mostly dated goods can collect dust .
i miss the old place , where i shopped for many years .
disappointed to see this change .
and he could n't find another pair ... .
no refund just store credit ... .
i refused the car , and no alternative was offered .
he offered me a no cost upgrade to a chevy suv .
the entire interaction with the agent was extremely unpleasant .
rented from here for years but under new management and it 's awful .
james told me no in person .
that was very rude and unprofessional .
i will not recommend anyone here .
the daycare , as i remember it , was a wild mess .
awful awful place .
she is _num_ .
my older son who was also there confirmed what my youngest had said .
i am just so done with this daycare .
crappy cleaners .
i was very disappointed with the way my clothes came back .
and it is $ _num_ an item .
but ... having been a dry cleaners daughter i am not impressed .
it has not been washed or thrown in the dryer which sets stains .
_num_ of the _num_ had to be returned .
so why ca n't they get it out ?
i do not recommend and i wo n't go back .
i probably will try another place when i decide to do this again .
rushed and poor quality .
i was rushed !
by far the worst ive ever had .
but it 's really not bad if you 're cheap like i am haha .
if i could , i would not even put one star for this place .
i walked in and they did n't even let me explain what i wanted .
they just rushed me in .
they only showed me what they were able to do .
worse place to go .
always had to wait 20-30 mins after booked appointment .
worst patient treatment .
they never seem to keep things on record for the life of them .
i am very glad to be at another doctor .
luckily this will my moms last visit here .
we are very unhappy with the way we have been treated .
worst doctor 's office i have ever been too .
left _num_ messages .
i gave one star bc i had to .
i 'll spare the name of my `` stylist '' but why , idk .
worst experience ever !
i ca n't believe she has a license to cut hair .
my hair went from the middle of my right below my collar bone .
i started crying in the chair and my hair fell to the floor .
she kept none of the length .
walked in , received horrible service so , walked out .
what nasty looking stylists .
disappointed with the service i received from carrie today .
bad representation of the company .
i feel like i need a police officer , since i was just robbed .
is this some kind of sick joke ?
unfortunately , the finance manager was right out of a movie .
i will never buy another vehicle from bell lexus .
their service department ripped me off .
so it has been about _num_ years since i last purchased a vehicle .
so i asked to see another similar vehicle and asked for a test drive .
he talked to his manager while i sat at his desk waiting for him .
you ca n't be serious .
that 's not how you want people to buy car from you .
seriously people , stay away from this dealership .
after a short test drive we sat down to go over the numbers .
asked for a refund as i do not want this and they refused .
arrowhead and bell lexus is owned by same company .
worst new car sales experience ever .
was told first that all that was available from lexus was _num_ .
glad there are choices for other lexus dealerships .
these people are not a group with much integrity .
i asked the service manager to speak with the owner and was refused .
warning , they are not trustworthy .
poor customer service and lots of attitude .
not very responsive .
this lexus is just out for your money apparently , not for the customers .
soaked the interior of my truck , and my iphone .
were a bit crunchy like they were under cooked .
the plastic fork broke off in the first one .
the only thing good was the mac and cheese , and the corn bread .
not a fan of your new menu items at all .
they will be limited .
that 's what a job is !
sherry 's pampered pets should be shut down .
fast forward _num_ 1/2 years -- i desperately needed to use a restroom .
when we returned , our dog looked very tired and skinny .
the first time i fell in love .
i felt safe and secure leaving our little one with them .
so i booked a second appointment a few months later .
dropping her off felt like an inconvenience on their part .
i 'm thinking i am barely building a relationship with you guys .
am i limited to one person ?
the lady who picked up sounded extremely annoyed .
was rude and curt .
otherwise you are losing a customer .
very annoyed .
he was not groomed .
they would not let me until i paid the _num_ for nothing .
and seriously , who runs out of plain bagels at _num_ am on saturday ?
ok , rant time !
she will have no future in customer service i 'm sure of that .
great food , not so great barista knowledge .
i take my coffee cravings two miles down the street to dd now .
i rarely give bad reviews however this place needs help .
i waited _num_ minutes for _num_ toasted buttered bagels .
the problem here seems to be organization and timing .
you need to be quicker with a product that everyone wants .
it was a simple mistake .
any other einstein 's is better than this one .
i would give zero stars if i could .
`` we 're closed , do n't you understand ! ''
i 'm not asking to buy anything because i know cashier systems go off .
no smile , no greeting , just `` know what you want '' .
customer service was awful .
the food here is ok , and the location is convenient to my house .
the actual customer service is terrible here .
no more ice , especially on a day like the 4th of july .
friendly , no !
that guy has no business in the customer service industry .
i was so disappointed when i got home and realized what i had purchased .
a customer no more !
worst mcdonald 's ever .
unless you speak spanish do n't bother .
they messed up my order , were rude , and refused to correct it .
the speed of delivery of my food order was terrible .
it took _num_ minutes from the time of my order .
the store manager was the real problem .
he had no sense of urgency whatsoever for my order or anyone else .
this was very disappointing .
cashier was disgusting and unsanitary .
and they want _num_ an hour .
i left very confused how these reviews came about .
my friend ordered the lasagna , which tasted like a wendy 's cheeseburger .
i had a side of penne pasta covered in the bland marinara and vegetables .
the food was terrible .
my salmon was thin , overlooked , and fishy .
it was definitely not worth it .
husband ordered calamari , tasted like the oil was very old .
i have never been served spoiled lettuce at a restaurant .
what a disappointment .
we would not dine there again .
the food was bland and flavorless .
the atmosphere and pasta were n't bad .
my husband also said the espresso was n't bad .
ate here this evening , food was just ok .
the service was very slow and the help was not that friendly .
she was not worth _num_ % .
we just paid and left will never go back .
my chicken was dry .
disappointed .
i could n't eat it .
the food was alright , but quite pricey for a small italian restaurant .
i 'm not sure if i wanted that type of service again .
i 'm not sure why this restaurant gets the reviews it does .
first off ... salmon is not white ... its pink .
we spent _num_ dollars on the special that was far from special .
dried out crab stuffed in white chewing salmon .
the veal ... do n't get us started .
chewy and i 'm not convinced it was actually veal .
the vegetables on both plates were not even luke warm .
arrived promptly at 7:30 and the place was very busy , which i expected .
however , i was not greeted for some time once i got inside .
after this i still waited about _num_ minutes before being seated .
no servers came to the table .
_num_ more minutes go by , our bus boy comes again to refill waters .
the very busy staff seemed to have forgotten us .
we walked out .
i purchased tires from them with their warranty about _num_ months ago .
this is the worst experience i have ever had in the auto service industry .
the break pads woman left after _num_ hours .
i reply by stating that i do n't feel that i have a choice .
four hours for an oil change ?
free or not , my time is worth more than that .
i was sorely disappointed .
this place is ridiculous .
watched _num_ employees talk about nothing before that even started .
so my total out the door was $ _num_ .
well making this next appointment was the worst !
i called everyday at 8am for there stupid same day app .
if i could give them _num_ stars i would .
i said , `` oh , really '' all of them ? ''
along with replacing the old oil filter fletcher 's left on the car .
rip off with a bad attitude !
horrible and awful are not strong enough words .
_num_ months later i 'm still going through a quarter of oil per week .
he said no problem , he 'd give me a call shortly .
give me a break , too arrogant to even apologize .
do not buy tires from fletcher .
they do not warrant the tires they sell .
firestone had been with ford for _num_ years .
i will never buy another tire from fletcher and neither should you .
they are now splitting and are not standing by their warranty .
interesting that fletcher no longer sells firestone tires ?
that 's because they sold us a bad product .
do not buy tires here .
they do not stand by their product .
if i could give zero stars i would .
i hate it .
as soon as this runs out i will never return .
horrible horrible place and horrible staff .
i m so frustrated .
horrible rude customer service- they take advantage of women .
so we said no thank you and went to leave .
no one at fletcher even looked at our truck .
bad form fletcher , bad form .
can i give a _num_ star ?
worst service ever .
i do n't know why i return .
i would not recommend this place .
too bad they prefer to have an unhappy customer .
oh and i was told that i did n't hear home correctly .
the customer is wrong here apparently .
zero stars .
i wo n't go back there again .
horrible service .
do n't care about customer one bit .
just spent _num_ hours on appointment that was supposed to be _num_ min .
left vehicle mats dirty and grease on doors .
would give zero stars .
groupon says it 's $ _num_ value - it 's a total rip off .
they are very slow and good in terms of taking you on ride .
do n't trust this groupon coupons at all .
they told me it would take a few hours so no problem .
do not go to these locations .
he said he can try to get it done by 5:30 pm .
clearly not , sir .
you are incompetent .
he said he can try to get it done by 5:30 pm .
clearly not , sir .
you are incompetent .
unfortunately , i needed my car fixed .
my car was ready the following thursday .
i 'm worried they may do more damage .
the service was quick and cheap , $ _num_ while i waited .
disappointed with quantity .
not good .
sauce was way too sweet and crust was way too chewy .
i just wish i tried this one for lunch not a full dinner .
spinatos disappointed me big time .
the toppings were very sparse and not that fresh .
the sauce was so sweet i thought it was a frozen kid pizza .
the salad , while large , was brown wilted , bagged lettuce .
the ravioli was boring , the bread stick was hard and dried out .
i was not impressed at all by the entire meal .
ok so this place has the worst customer service and communication skills ever !
im not paying with a credit card or buying a car .
im just ordering a simple pizza or at least i thought i was anyway .
no such luck .
ok , we 'll get pizza for saturday .
the sauce is tasteless , and just that , canned tomato sauce .
people , this is not good pizza .
we came here one night for pizza and had an unpleasant surprise .
the sauce was horrible !
it was sweet and my taste buds were confused .
go figure that the employees do n't even like the pizza .
it was very strange .
my fiance at one tiny slice and walked out hungry .
yelpers , you seriously are high to give this joint anything over _num_ stars .
how difficult is it to chop some garlic ?
i really do n't understand the raves for this place .
menu price is $ _num_ but with the $ _num_ ( ! )
delivery charge , tax and tip this medium pizza cost us almost $ _num_ .
it barely satisfied our craving for actual pizza .
i ordered a side caesar to begin and a pepperoni calzone .
the caesar dressing was very fishy .
the pizza sauce was way too sweet .
while there are worse places to eat , there are certainly better .
first visit , and just eating at bar on my own .
this is bad policy .
such a waste .
the one star rating is solely for the company policy .
( well at least it 's hot ) not .
like it had been sitting around for quite some time .
( maybe the mozzarella sticks will be great ) cold .
just like the super _num_ i ordered .
i 'll try again but not right away .
one of the worst dining experiences that we have had .
came in hungry , left very hungry !
we waited another _num_ minutes for another personal pizza to come out .
calzone , was cold inside , we could n't believe it !
we waited _num_ minutes for cold food .
unfortunately , experience was complete ruined by this time .
such a shame !
i was disappointed .
reason for the _num_ star is the sauce it is very sugary .
in my opinion sauce should not taste like this .
tonight we ordered from the bell rd location .
their breadsticks with mozzarella was the equivalent to poor man homemade breadsticks .
not impressed .
unfortunately the pizza was awful .
it is pretty slow here .
this place sucks .
i 'm sorry but how do u screw up a simple pizza delivery ?
he insisted , `` that 's how you get it to go . ''
everyone was friendly but they should be considerably more accommodating to customer requests .
spinato 's has lost my business forever .
an answering system says i 'm 3rd in line .
i tried again about _num_ times within the next hour .
same thing .
ridiculous !
i totally understand that places get crazy busy .
no information or sorry they were closed .
soggy crust , toppings were very sparse , and it was really greasy .
for the price too , i expected more .
everybody said to go to heritage so i did .
the guy was rude and said you ca n't steam a straw hat .
my sweet potato fries ( large ) were like half .
straws ?
their drinks were flat .
our burgers were thrown together and sloppy .
not so much a church as a huge theater .
no one really gets to know anyone .
this `` church '' is not for me .
because we were n't apart of the church .
the only reason to go to this church is for the performing arts .
leaving this church today , i feel extremely disappointed .
bottom line , this church is full of smoke and mirrors , quite literally .
glory should be given to god , not to a church or its pastor .
god spoke to me and told me to run !
- extremely long wait times .
i showed up this morning at 8:00 on the dot .
bottom line i would not recommend this shop to anyone .
she wanted $ _num_ more to blow dry .
as it is , i do not plan to return .
do you realize how many disease you can spread like that ?
which hey why did n't you put those on before hand ?
that 's horribly annoying when i just paid _num_ bucks for both .
so i need a haircut .
i leave a message explaining i will be a few minutes late .
sandy , however , has left .
and in my opinion , neither should you .
do not go here for eyebrow waxing !
my neck hurt the entire time .
not professional , not my cup of tea .
the male bathroom was very dirty .
the women 's bathroom is hardly ever cleaned .
i feel like nobody should have to clean the toilets themselves .
it should be clean already for their customers .
whoever is the new manager there increased prices so much it 's ridiculous !
the staff at this location has zero sense of urgency .
it drives me crazy !
never been to a worse starbucks .
went to the drive thru and kim was rude and unfriendly .
no sense of urgency unlike the other locations i 've been to .
you are now on my shit list 7th st and bell starbucks .
the latter was very mean .
i was really uncomfortable with the way she spoke down to her coworker .
no wait '' promise with the app .
totally messed up my cut .
what a great first time horrible experience .
why was i never told this information the day before ?
why are you avoiding me ?
your company was also kind enough to suggest other insurance companies i should consider .
i am not avoiding you .
after a couple rounds of that i decided to just find everything myself .
do not do business with this salon !
her attitude ( for someone her age ) was very poor .
this salon is terrible .
i purchased a groupon for a shellac manicure & pedicure .
i wo n't go back .
the tech diane or diana was nice but not at all thorough .
the hand massage was lame and lasted all of _num_ mins per hand .
when i left i realized that she had indeed polished over my old polish !
i would definitely not be going back to that salon .
obnoxious clients and less than excellent nail tech .
- noisy because same place offers haircuts , nail spa and what not .
this is the worst business ever .
they were rude and not sorry at all , even the owner .
they should really not be in business .
desperate !
a really terrible place .
the girl who was going to do my massage came out to greet me .
kind of a mess and not a good sign of what 's to come .
cold lotion at that , it was n't even warmed !
she also tried to sell me product , but was not overly pushy .
what a complete mess .
on top of it , the nail service itself was rushed .
the tech was nice and polite , but not very good .
unbelievable .
she keep having to clean the polish off my toes .
they certainly lost a potential return customer in me .
i also purchased a groupon when they offered it .
they are not affiliated with the hilton and that 's very misleading .
_num_ months after my review , the owner posts a comment .
the groupon does n't cover what they had to do to fix my hair .
no it does n't .
fix your mistake , and do n't charge me extra for it .
whatever you do do n't go there with a groupon .
our property management company sent them out .
worst ac company in the whole valley !
do not use this company !
they will tell you something is wrong when there is n't !
nothing but problems !
not a fan at all .
i threw it out after a few bites .
you would have to be wasted to think this place was a gem .
but that is nothing that requires work .
but restaurant always clean in dining area & staff always friendly .
i would avoid this shop , it is not an ethical or reasonable place .
others just want a quick buck at your expense .
probably one of the worst experiences of my life !
i would give this place a zero if i could !
avoid this place at all cost !
horrible customer service.
Neutral
i would give negative stars if i could .
one is a little chunky and the other is really skinny .
the vet told me my skinny dog was over weight !
i told them that their scale was off but they said it was n't .
so my entire annual visit was based around wrong information .
and i feel they talked to you like you were an idiot .
they also overcharge for teeth cleaning .
i would not recommend this vet .
now he is dead .
do not suggest this place .
they 're a rip off and out to get your money !
big mistake !
the vet that saw us was extremely rude and made me feel uncomfortable !
very disappointed with this place !
we found a _num_ week stray kitten by our home last week .
they would not help us help the kitten by giving us any discount .
in a nut shell : the good , the bad , and the ugly .
now for the bad .
i said , wait a minute , i see what is going on here .
never a , `` hi , how is the new bike ? ''
now for the ugly .
my model of harley had a recall on the gas tank filler neck .
ok , no biggie , took it in to their service dept .
employees .
kind of like : we know it all and you are a dumb ass .
as they rolled my bike away the alarm went off .
they charged me $ _num_ dollars for it ?
and have to make another appointment to address the other problems , not happening !
_num_ % horrible management and sub-par mechanics .
oh and then ... ready for this ?
really _num_ freaking days ?
bad work and terrible management !
try returning a bad battery .
hd batteries are supposed to be high quality .
the battery case states _num_ month replacement if defective .
no chance .
the store was not remotely busy .
only giving one star because zero is not an option .
the service at this dealership is hands down the worst i have ever seen .
they of course denied any wrong doing or mistakes .
spent over _num_ min in there .
store is not crowded whatsoever .
i will not spend a single dollar here .
but , i will not have them service my bike again .
this is why they should be rated less than _num_ star !
tl ; dr the worst service ever received .
instead , when i called back i was forced to talk to frank instead .
miserable cow !
ended up at scottsdale hd where the staff went the extra mile to help .
the worst harley dealer in phoenix !
this place is horrible !
during my six month lease my apartment was broken into twice .
the neighbors are horrible and the apartments are tiny .
terrible staff and management .
do n't waste your time on these apartments .
i go back the next day , to get my money back .
dont .
like bat ( you know what ) crazy .
the pool there ... yah , just do n't .
so its probably a walking fest pool _num_ % of the year .
the salsa and everything else was processed , canned , pre-made garbage !
ordered takeout and was not impressed .
the hostess answering the phone was rude as well .
it was so greasy it looked more like enchilada soup .
she was n't really impressed either .
i 've had manuel 's before it never was this terrible before .
looks like valle luna from now on .
consistency in preparation is also missing .
but , i do n't know why people are raving about this place .
plus , the egg roll was ridiculous .
in the trash .
that was my budget lunch .
disappointing , but not bad enough to write them off just yet .
not sure what all the other reviewers are talking about unfortunately .
first visit was not that impressive .
just horrible .
waiter pushed back when i sent the bad food away .
i found this place to be pretty mediocre .
i found this place to be pretty mediocre .
so , about _num_ stars for the food , _num_ for the service .
but the food is n't that great .
the meat was undercooked both times i tried beef and chicken .
the only two good things are the veggie rolls and the vegetable soup .
i do n't recommend it unless it was for either of those .
i wo n't be back .
the pad thai was not as good .
if i went back , i would only get the salad .
the food is way too salty .
i had the shrimp salad and it was horrible .
they also charge gratuity after the tax when that 's apparently illegal .
but the guy was like well that 's illegal !
overall service is great but the food is a disappointment .
way too salty .
this night 's meal was beyond a total let down though .
the thai soup staple .
like , how can you make terrible tom yum ?
even when it 's bad it 's not so bad , right ?
this tom yum was so bad , it was inedible .
mushy ( as in possibly spoiled ) shrimp .
i 'd like to think something went seriously wrong with the recipe tonight .
flavorless .
pei wei 's thai noodles probably would have been a better option .
should be sour with some heat .
not spicy .
after trying most of the restaurants here , i 've all but given up .
this experience tonight was really the bottom of the pack .
nothing was even slightly spicy .
all sweet , no heat .
so much to pick at , wo n't be returning .
the tom yum soup is not tom yum .
it 's ok , but it 's definitely not tom yum .
the instant i tried it , i thought `` this is strange .
it seems like we got in trouble for something they did wrong .
i myself do not mind spicy foods .
i called the restaurant and she said they would make a new one .
i drove all the way back and handed over the original food .
very disappointing to say the least .
worst customer service and follow-up appointment .
man was sitting at desk and never bothered to greet .
terrible , extremely noticeable and customer service unprofessional .
nor would we still be unsatisfied after a 2nd counter tops was installed .
over the last few years they have changed managers several times .
when i go in there they always fix the problem right away .
the regional director even sent me an email .
this place has constant management turn over .
this was the absolute worst storage facility .
as a business person the experience here is unprofessional .
i do not recommend this storage facility .
i have used this storage facility on and off for ten years .
at all times .
it 's just not worth it .
based on the reviews , this place sounded like a home run .
i was so disappointed !
unfortunately , everything about my general tso 's combo was subpar .
the meat was all dark meat , and some of it quite fatty .
please do n't waste your time or money !
absolutely horrible , it taste as bad as the building looks !
horrible service too !
will try again if i 'm in the need for delivery .
it is downright awful .
i would rather pick up good food than get ripped off .
Negative
i would give negative stars if i could .
first off , how long can a place be open and still be new ?
the total was $ _num_ and some change .
it was n't delicious whatsoever .
as a matter of fact , it was n't even good .
i am very disappointed in this .
i wo n't be ordering from new north china again .
i would recommend you look elsewhere .
quite possibly the worst meal i 've ever had delivered .
breaded chicken was just ok , vegetables were still raw in sauce .
never returning to this place again !
i was really disappointed with the way the staff treats the customers .
i was over charged and they would not refund me .
oh wait someone did remove my old polish and then she walked away .
so i am still sitting here .
hmm that does n't seem right .
then the owner came over to finish my pedicure .
ugh .
this is the worst customer service i have experienced at a nail salon .
not only that but the worst pedicure experience .
my suggestion , do n't come here ever .
worst experience ever .
once i was going to pay they said it is _num_ for both !
i was so pissed !
are you kidding me ?
i told them they should have mentioned that to me before !
they are so unprofessional here , and the customer service sucks !
total disappointment !
i went to this place one time and it sucked bad .
my nails did n't last a week .
this may be the worst nail salon on the planet .
she also had her dirty hands all over my face .
less than _num_ hours later my nails were ruined .
this place has terrible service .
if they had a _num_ star rating i would give them a _num_ .
they tried to charge me _num_ when their board says _num_ .
this place needs a _num_ star rating !
the owner is a rude jerk and could care less about the customers .
i went in today to get a pedicure and gel manicure .
the women doing my nails was extremely rough and just rushed through the pedicure .
even though i opted for the $ _num_ spa pedicure .
this place is awful !
do not waste your money or time .
oh and the salon is dirty .
rude and not welcoming !
i would give them zero stars if allowed .
sat down and they were not that busy .
after sitting there for over an hour , i was ready to leave .
but to be charged $ _num_ for a half butt pedicure was insane .
Negative
of course , this was not the case .
i would suggest that nobody goes there .
they are terrible .
_num_ mins to start ordering .
then was told an _num_ minute wait for egg rolls .
i passed at least a dozen restaurants to get here .
terrible !
very rude serving people .
they give you rude face and shout up to ask again .
got charged _num_ dollars for a meal that was _num_ dollars .
getting charged for ranch when it comes with your meal is ridiculous .
also the people there are rude .
the tables are so dirty , the floors are even worse !
this place is a ripoff .
they had no concern for my situation , the staff is very unfriendly .
do not use this company .
boy this place has gone down the can .
food bad .
so i give her zero stars !
so i give a total of _num_ stars because of the servers one star .
they brought me a basket with one piece of chicken breast cut in half .
this was the most horrible for i 've had in years !
first of all my hair was so long , it touched my butt !
i do not recommend taking your vehicle here .
one of the services firestone had recommended was replacing the air filter .
please do not take your vehicle to them .
this place is hit or miss .
they told me they would n't charge me if that was the case .
i used to take all _num_ vehicles to these guys .
i 'm sad to say but not happy with their business anymore .
no apology no more business .
at this point , i should of left .
they were fuzzy and really poor quality .
i went in did the full exam with the upgraded digital eye test etc .
come to find out i need reading glasses to which i knew already .
are you kidding me ?
this place has no right to be in business treating customers like this .
on one of these visits , dr. cook gave my puppy a shot .
worst dentist office in town .
i pulled off the freeway to reschedule my appointment .
these people do n't care about you or your mouth .
do not bring your business to this facility .
initially i was completely satisfied , price payment plans staff .
but i 've later it has closed .
i found the dentist and my problem has been taken care of .
i said `` shadow '' and she was so rude to me .
about _num_ years ago my dog was in a grooming accident .
his new staff treats everyone like garbage .
very polite and knowledgable !
he gave my dog her shots and everything went smoothly .
the staff there is extremely rude !
there were two girls there that were particularly rude .
jen and i am not sure of the other one .
this was frustrating to say the least .
do n't be fooled by this vets lies .
if i was lying - ridiculous .
it looked like there was _num_ people working here .
the only plus here is the drinks !
there is just something about it that 's not good .
this place is gross .
there is nothing fresh about this mexican grill .
i would like to give it a higher rating but just ca n't .
the food is mostly tasteless and sloppy .
my daughter and i left without finishing our food .
one bonus star for not getting sick from anything .
i ordered a spicy chicken burrito that was blech !
nothing good about that thing .
this turned out to be a good thing since the burrito was awful .
needless to say i wont come near this place ever again .
how can a eatery get mexican food so wrong ?
i got a fajita burrito and the peppers and onions were boiled .
the chicken was bland .
i would never advise this place .
i hate to be mean .
this place was hard to find anything good .
big mistake .
the service was really terrible .
which had little to no taste , if that 's even possible .
only the quesadilla was edible .
horrible .
all the food is watery & lacking real flavor .
even the salsa is pretty crappy .
i have never had someone be so rude and dismissive .
would give this joke of a salon _num_ stars if at all possible .
the stylist was _num_ min late to the appointment we made over the phone .
she spoke in a condescending rude tone .
avoid this place like the plague .
not so good when it comes to execution of a quality haircut .
went in looking for something pretty basic , a shorter disconnected look .
stylist said she works with short hair but unfortunately it did n't appear so .
unsatisfied & will not be returning .
she spent more time asking questions like `` does that look even ? ''
no it is n't !
went to sincerely your hair salon dec 20th ... color already coming out .
went in for a trim and thin .
paid $ _num_ a little too expensive for my taste .
the pork was sliced thin but was _num_ % fat .
i went in the late afternoon and the place was empty .
my bbq beans were alright , nothing special .
our waitress finished up her performance by adding up our bill incorrectly .
the place was empty .
i suspect that they are just as attentive to strangers though .
the day before new yrs eve i was craving some good bbq .
i promised myself no more meat except fish starting new years .
it was dry and tough and tasted pretty salty .
about half way through my stomach started crying for help .
i had to stop eating and i thought i was going to die .
not at all like last time .
not one bit !
onion rings were ok meh nothing to write about .
but the beef and the pork were a huge disappointment .
for one thing , it was hard to tell which was which ( ! )
i seriously doubt the beef was brisket , as it was dry and lean .
but i do n't think there 's any way we 're trying them again .
the fries were average , and the coleslaw had zero flavor .
the rib tips were cold inside .
when i told the waitress , she apologized and said that they come frozen .
i could n't believe that a bbq restaurant would have frozen meat .
this place was so disappointing .
i will not be coming back .
came here with friends to satisfy a bbq craving .
i had to pour on bbq sauce .
i had been wanting to have barbeque for awhile .
this was the only place that was close to me .
that was a mistake .
there was no other customers inside and the food was incredibly bland .
it ran just under $ _num_ .
for my sides i had mac & cheese and baked beans .
i would not recommend going here to anyone .
i personally will not be going back .
had the brisket and the bbq beef sandwich + sides .
everything was no good .
the meat was dry the sides were bland .
in summary , do n't go here .
the fried rice was simply rice with soy sauce and maybe somewhat fried ?
the noodles they had were pretty bland .
the curry was really bland and watery .
we should have gone to dq instead .
recent home delivery was a horrible experience from beginning to end .
food was awful .
crab puffs were almost flat , more like fried won tons .
then the food was yuck !
this has to be the worst !
i gave one star just cause we did not get sick !
but short of that i would give zero stars if i could .
that 's how bad the food and the service was .
here is your warning .
chow mein was watery and tasteless .
if want a list of place to stay away .
the food was mediocre .
the egg rolls were horrible but i liked the fried wontons .
overall the food was ok but it 's not something i would order again .
horrible service !
beware when ordering they will not even attempt to correct there mistake !
the driver seemed friendly enough and made a little small talk at the door .
worst restaurant experience in my life .
please do not support dragon bowl and take your business elsewhere .
they recently just switch ownership about _num_ years ago .
the food is great , but if they are busy they are very rude .
they really have no idea how to treat people .
nothing special but nothing to complain about .
but i felt really gross after eating it .
rice was n't cooked right and had little flavor .
chicken smelled good , but did n't taste all that great .
could have used more sauce and veggies .
not impressed at all .
although , the portions were large , the food was extremely bland .
i will not be ordering from them again .
killing time before meeting friends so i thought i 'd grab a lunch special .
there were four other parties but one was a table of _num_ .
the two servers were hopping , trying to keep up .
the fried rice was sad .
no flavor even tho it was fried .
the wontons were seriously over cooked .
the orange chicken was also lacking .
if you are searching for awesome chinese , this is not the place .
you are better off at panda express or pf changs .
fried rice was undercooked .
really disappointed .
ridiculous .
the pants that needed to be hemmed were not done as i had requested .
they were nice and the drive through window is convenient .
this was ridiculous .
where are the flat rate cleaners ?
i typically drop off _num_ - _num_ shirts at a time .
i would suggest you bring your business elsewhere .
this is a sleazy operation .
such a shame .
no phone call to inform me .
just charged me the $ _num_ instead of the $ _num_ .
but when i came back their was no credit .
horrible customer service .
zero stars .
i was a client of r & r for approximately _num_ years .
my pool had been a mess for a couple years , it needed work .
i sent text messages and i left messages .
i am loyal to fault .
it is with heavy heart i have to leave this sort of review .
do n't waste your time with these guys .
was very disappointed with their service .
my pool was not clean from the day they started .
also that a gear was bad so pop ups did not work .
he wanted to charge me $ _num_ .
i do not trust this company and will cancel service with them this week .
i can not recommend them .
so i waited hoping the atm would figure out i was done .
after about _num_ more minutes i gave up and left .
never , never , never go to this store if you can help it .
horrible customer service !
very inconsistent food and service .
i will not be buying from domino 's again .
the food we got tonight was laughable .
typically candied with bbq , it was burned to a crisp and dry .
philly cheese pizza was as dry as the desert sand .
hour and _num_ mins later i call to confirm .
no answer and they never delivered the pizza !
just tell me you are n't going to deliver .
very very disappointed in this place .
this is horrible !
said it left at _num_ landed at _num_ .
burnt and cold , wth ?
waited over _num_ minutes on hold to talk to cesar the manager .
told him how burnt the pizza is and it was cold when landed .
zero stars would have been except able !
no thanks !
got my order almost _num_ hours after ordering , it was free but still .
i have taken my dog here for extended boarding twice .
both times he was sick when i picked him up .
do not take your pet to this place !
the owners of the other dogs were not notified .
furthermore , the staples were placed wrong , which caused an infection .
this place does not care about your pet .
sketchy doggie day care .
it is sad that my beloved vet 's office has disappointed me .
my jaw dropped ... why was i looking for another doctor ?
none of my four rescue dogs will ever be stepping into this facility again .
i came there to get answers , solutions and remedy for my little pup .
i am extremely disappointed and felt like i was robbed in plain sight .
i do not recommend this place to get any sort of treatment .
that does n't sound like a general practice facility to me .
i will be looking for a new vet for my _num_ dogs .
do not trust your beloved pet to this place !
so , i called back and asked specifically what blood work they did .
are you kidding me ?
so my sample was thrown away .
i brought both of my blue nose pits in due to skin problems .
the doctor pushed pills .
they use the same treatment for every issue for every breed .
they are disrespectful , and refuse to take responsibility for their actions .
i will never go to this salon again to get any service .
i have been a customer of this nail salon for over a year .
last week i called to schedule an appointment .
will never go here again !
rude .
lazy .
i 've never been so insulted .
and i 'm not even a difficult client .
i continued to go back week after week because she was good .
but i 'm none of that .
in fact , when i find what i like , i 'm loyal .
that 's just lazy !
today , they lost a customer and a fan .
Positive
i 'm disappointed i ca n't give a zero star or negative star rating .
very disappointed with the pedicure i received .
it was only that one nail so my overall pedicure is inconsistent .
looking at my nails this past week has been extremely disappointing .
i paid $ _num_ to be embarrassed how terrible my nails look .
people in phoenix must have pretty low standards .
the nail tech who took care of me did a horrible job !
she was just awful !
the second time i came in and it was horrible !
i was so offended !
i asked him again to go shorter and he refused .
i finally picked a color and he did a horrible job .
i left and my nails looked horrible .
i 'm never going here again !
i 'm making sure everyone knows how i feel about this credit union .
i went to check in at my hotel and my card came back declined .
as was the case tonight .
the teller told me the atm is old and something inside is worn out .
Neutral
it says something very negative about the organization .
was n't going to write a review originally , but now i must .
went through the drive thru and they got our orders all wrong .
not even close .
they still got it wrong .
have n't been happy with the blizzards in a very long time .
wish dq could get their act together .
she said she was going to go and try to fix the bad writing .
we waited in the drive through for about _num_ minutes for _num_ blizzards .
it 's close to the worst strip club i 've ever been to .
this place is way over crowded and i have no idea why .
a disappointment on every level .
i would not recommend .
i agree with most $ _num_ is minimal compared to other establishments .
the girls are ok but the staff is awful .
low class , all around .
then when she got on stage ... she put in work .
plus there were maybe _num_ tables with chairs against the wall for lap dances .
that was not the case .
the installers were nice enough but barely spoke english .
they said that jenny never comes to the jobs .
no one addressed the problems .
no one followed through .
they made a lot of mistakes and did some sloppy work .
i would not use them again .
this subway is the absolute worst !
the staff of this place is so strange .
we should n't have to pay for this garbage !
so why am i so incredibly angry right now ?
no , that 's not good customer service .
garbage every single time !
he had to be put on _num_ weeks of antibiotics and a head cone .
i ca n't believe what an ordeal this has turned into .
it 's unfortunate that i feel the need to give a two star rating .
i said i will get them fixed later to avoid more charges .
i have a bad feeling that my tire rotation was n't even completed .
because there 's no proof they messed up .
i would advise everyone to stay far away from this facility !
i was n't sure why they were ignoring me .
so finally i turned the car off and went inside .
( normally that is all i get ) .
and i drove my car out .
the gentleman that took my coupon said i could n't use it .
he would let me have a $ _num_ coupon .
customer service is not at all what it was !
Neutral
to the negative experience ... .
it 's like you 're trying to make every race hate you even more .
i 'm not done yet .
cashiers surly .
i hate this place !
and the cashier lady forced me into buying a large drink .
lol cheap people .
not to mention _num_ dollars for two sandwiches is insane .
maybe even a little cheap .
very disappointed ordered _num_ sandwiches and two soups .
threw the sandwich away and had a bowl of cereal !
so disappointed !
but no doubt this place has a serious customer service problem .
bad business .
i went in this saturday morning hoping to avoid the lines at home depot .
mike m ( the manager ) has seen to the lines .
i could n't wait to put the store in my rear view mirror .
this place is really down .
i had been washing my cars here for _num_ years .
it has significantly gone downhill the past two years however .
suffice it to say , the lack of maintenance of equipment really shows .
it all falls on ownership .
this little spot used to be good , but no longer .
wrong .
so very very wrong .
it better prove useful .
_num_ minutes later and i 'm told it is low .
smell something fishy yet ?
now if you excuse me , i have a district manager to write .
terrible service .
went next door and they checked and filled all tires , two minutes .
if i could put no stars i would .
so i had to have my wife pick me up .
ok are these brake pads made of gold ?
big o , big no !
we spent just under $ _num_ for all _num_ tires .
she was told that all _num_ tires needed to be replaced .
to our surprise they wanted over $ _num_ to replace the tires .
i personally wo n't be going back to big o again .
then i sat there for over _num_ minutes and i was never approached .
approach with caution ... you have been warned !
crappy pours .
bartender needs to go back to school on how to do a decent pour .
two of us get there first and walk into a practically empty bar .
there is nothing i consider redeeming by this place .
they have beer , they have standard grub and standard everything else .
she had never had alcohol and was excited to try her first shot .
however , the waitress , amy , was completely rude to us !
the flavor was good but just too much .
horrible food !
walked in the door right after _num_ with the boyfriend to grab some food .
we listened to _num_ karaoke songs and nothing .
by far the worst way to start off .
they were about half full too , so no excuse .
after _num_ mins no beers , no chips .
no show .
i really wish i could give a good review , i just can not .
of course she did not write it down .
worst service ever !
i was quoted that this part would cost $ _num_ .
i looked online today and could get _num_ shipped to me for $ _num_ .
i guess that 's a pet peeve of mine .
stay away from this poorly run company !
i met him in the front yard and told him the problem .
rude , unprofessional salesperson !
i kicked him out of my home within _num_ minutes of his arrival .
despite his initial rudeness , i invited him in .
i can only imagine how bad their service would be .
on november _num_ i took me car in for an oil change .
my car did n't arrive back until 8:00 pm that evening .
i talked to the manager joey .
i will never use firestone for any services ever again .
if i could give them no stars i would .
recently i took my jeep in to get the steering wheel corrected .
i would not recommend them at all .
sloppy work .
the next time i came back to get my ac fixed .
i had them run all of the tests to see what was wrong .
i drove off and the ac did not work !
there goes $ _num_ down the drain !
Negative
if i could give negative stars i would !
i can not even start to tell you how horrible these scum bags are !
i am livid , as are the other one star reviews .
my car was supposed to be take to the repair shop .
instead it was take to there yard .
what scum bags !
absolutely horrible business .
i was in an accident and my car was totaled .
i left several messages for kevin and he never returned one .
are you kidding me ?
would not ever use these jerks .
worst place ever !
will not be coming back here , waste of time .
the water was cold .
all in all i 'm never going back there .
i could n't wait to get out of there .
i will never return to this place .
i have no idea how this salon has the star rating it does .
you 've been warned .
_num_ .
she cut my toe nails so low that i was bleeding .
_num_ .
she asked me if i had a boyfriend in an awkward way _num_ .
_num_ .
that 's all folks !
not a single nail looks professional .
the only reason they got two stars was my pedicure .
i would have given them a zero if i could have .
they literally treated me like i was a circus freak .
went with my mom to get regular manicures , not gel .
but my moms are completely ruined .
like the previous reviewer , i would give zero stars if i could .
sunday no call .
monday no call .
cashiers dont know how to count .
i 'm not sure how they manage to keep a stellar rating .
the chimichanga was pathetic , too .
it was literally _num_ '' wide by _num_ '' long by _num_ '' tall .
that 's for a $ _num_ chimi .
as for this place : i tried it ... probably wo n't be back .
as i walked in , there was a woman washing tables .
i walked out and threw in the trash , so disgusted !
had a burrito , but it was n't very good .
the first half of it tasted like all beans .
the 2nd half was better , but still left a lot to be desired .
the hot salsa was not my flavor and i like the hot salsas .
i wo n't go back .
lost my appetite as well as craving for this place .
never going back !
it was ok , they messed part of the order .
they said sure no problem and that was it .
no invoice came .
he said it was too much and they did _num_ $ for him .
several bad experiences with this pizza place ... today was the worst .
thankfully there was a restaurant next door that knew the law .
i 'm confused why is called , `` hot and ready . ''
whenever i go there i have to wait for my pizza .
but for the price $ _num_ you ca n't be that upset .
called and placed an order to pick up and was told _num_ mins .
i was told another _num_ mins to get it started .
waited another _num_ minutes until they had my order ready .
in line for gas !
spent _num_ two weeks ago to fix my charger .
a week later it 's broke down again .
money runs this shop not honesty !
very sad example for the rest of the automotive repair community .
this one is barely acceptable .
either the whole chain has changed , or this place is below standards .
i 'm not coming back .
and to top all off , their sandwiches are n't all that good !
avoid this place and just go to subway .
you 'll get a better sandwich without the attitude .
check your receipt before you walk out the door ... .
ok on the phone but rude and unhelpful in person .
in short , they stole $ _num_ from me .
i looked through it all and i have nothing that states this .
to sum this up , do not give this credit union your money !
unfortunately , i do not have access to my account number .
this place is awful .
i told her to forget it and walked out .
obviously this place does n't need business !
no , really , i want them shorter .
if you have an appointment , you may even wait longer .
they said no wait and sat us down immediately .
_num_ minutes later no one had come over to start my pedicure .
i ultimately did not get the pedicure .
it was a little uncomfortable .
seriously terrible work .
the one nail looks so horrible !
do n't waste your time or money !
that really was the least of my problems with this place !
terrible pedicure and terrible gel nails .
do n't know where my review went but this place is gross !
i wrote a terrible review for this place and now it is gone !
just want to say this place is filthy !
smells like sewage and cigarette smoke !
i got the worst gel manicure here last week .
the gel on my thumb was all lumpy when i left .
_num_ days later the gel is peeling off and my nails are breaking .
plenty more in area to choose from i will not be back !
she did n't even wrap them first .
horrible !
i do n't even know how that is possible .
it was so bad .
also , they were rushing like crazy .
additionally , they have no options for designs .
i tipped much less than i normally would 've .
it was literally that bad !
stay away from this awful place !
will not be going back .
trust me is not worth the money you pay !
every time i have been here i have had horrible service .
last time i went , i made an appointment for two pedicures .
once we finally sat in the chairs they ignored us for about _num_ minutes .
my manicure was awful !
it looks like a _num_ year old painted my nails .
very poor customer service and unprofessional !
i will not go back !
do not spend your money here !
if i could give zero stars i would .
their customer service is awful .
reservations mean nothing and sunny is horrible .
terrible customer service !
one of the male employees , sunny , is rude and incompetent .
i could n't believe the attitude of the woman doing the pedicure .
it hurt and burned , but i said nothing .
i do n't like this place anymore .
i 'm now going elsewhere .
i would give this place zero stars if i could .
also the smell of chemicals was overpowering .
petsmart is the worst place to take your dog .
do you really trust your dogs with these employees ?
the dog grooming is even worse .
how annoying !
they wanted to charge me $ _num_ to treat my cats ear infection .
they are extremely overpriced and it 's not personal whatsoever .
do n't use the grooming service .
i told them about their mistake , and they denied it .
they rolled their eyes at me and made me explain over and over again .
rude staff .
terrible experience for my dog .
i took my dog to this petsmart for a bath .
when she finally did get up , she made a loud yelp .
horrible care .
horrible service !
my dog has been using petsmart for everything .
what a waste !
the little dog was screaming in pain and terrified !
because the dog was hurt and trying to get away ?
shame on you petsmart !
the grooming services here are not good .
i was there in september and never again !
petsmart shaved her too far up , in the stomach area .
very unhappy with the way we and our dog were treated today .
after _num_ hours our dog was still not ready .
do not take your pets to banfield !
was quoted over $ _num_ to replace a piece of glass on a picture .
the only difference is that jesse and frank did n't have a website !
when i walked up to the counter , there was no cashier present .
i finally snapped this photo because i was bored .
i would 've expected better service from a restaurant so close to pv .
overall , it was n't too bad , but it was inconsistent .
i do n't expect much from any fast food restaurant .
truth be told , no honest person does .
that is something that this particular location of taco bell sorely lacks .
i have been there at 10:30 , and they 're open .
do n't advertise you are open if you 're not going to be open .
do n't promise the public hours and do n't deliver .
there is none . ''
i hate to be a dick .
but there are just some things that need to be brought to attention .
or , the management staff just made and employee lie to customers .
he was nice enough to toss in a free cinnamon twist bag .
closed to the point of even the outside lights being off .
it was a black hole in the parking lot .
according to taco bell 's website , they should have been open .
the cashier was new so someone helped him which was fine .
she was very snotty when telling me this .
so when i get my food everything is wrong .
they gave me the crunch wrap .
they always try to up sell extra services that are unnecessary .
after the shot , we received a receipt and no further information .
the vet never asked me about my dogs past shot records .
seriously ?
- with our plan , we 're supposed to save money .
only in the fine print of our numerous page contract .
- i 'm disappointed with the quality of healthcare the dogs have received .
overall , i 'm convinced banfield and their animal plans are a scam .
would not recommend .
i have never been treated so rudely in my life .
just waiting for my contract to end .
in an emergency you can not get your pet seen .
they are a bit corporate , pushing medical plans for dogs .
an independent vet might be a better choice for many .
they called to deliver some test results and i missed their call .
a word too the wise do n't take your pets here !
this particular panda express is so gross ... .
it 's not fair for me to compare panda with that , but c'mon !
why does this place charge so much , but provide such low quality food ?
menu was completely different and has a bad attempt of being like a subway .
there was also a new employee which could have added to this .
just stick to the cold subs and you should be fine .
the store itself is ok , but the bathroom is disgusting !
i use this copy and print center about _num_ days a week for work .
so for now i will deal with , however it 's very frustrating !
Neutral
if i could give negative stars , i would .
i walked out of the store .
once again , he did n't look at it .
worst experience ever .
i went in for my appointment which they told me would take _num_ hours .
no wonder , _num_ visits = more $ $ $ in their pockets .
i blew it off .
gina advised that insurance came back and my co pay was $ _num_ .
i also saw another yelp review with the same problem .
there is a really rude sales lady here .
she 's terrible '' .
all the other employees were very helpful .
will not go back to this location .
i tried to purchase patio furniture covers using a gift card over the phone .
i am very unhappy with the service and the way it has been handled .
they however try to sell broken toys .
i will not be coming back !
not nearly as good as russian groceries in other cities .
some bakery items are stale depending on turnover .
vegetables are hit or miss , but some items worth the trip .
husband and wife owners could be friendlier .
very disappointed by quality of products !
no one item had price tag on it , no wonder why , overpriced !
chocolate bar $ _num_ are you serious !
the cold meat cuts looks old !
is owners even try what they sell ?
absolutely disgusting , if u looking for russian food stay away from that place .
way overpriced .
tasted horrible .
worst cake i ever had .
_num_ ) russian mustard : made me sick .
i would be giving zero stars if my second experience was my only experience .
unfortunately , i had a bad experience .
the office staff is rude and not at all helpful .
i would not recommend this office to anyone .
unfortunately however i am not reviewing her , but the office as a whole .
needless to say , i will never be returning to this office .
it was ridiculous .
i am so furious with the way that they run this office .
try and make your schedule work , do n't cancel people .
i 'm livid and would not return here if you paid me to !
this place is a mess .
the front office personnel is incompetent .
very disappointing .
i had the worst experience of my life back in january .
the front staff was so rude on the phone .
dr. nelson has no bedside manner what so ever .
he drop the bomb with little to no bedside manner .
he could have asked my son to step out and then tell me .
then he walked out with out explaining anything and basically just dipped out .
again the front staff was rude and dismissive .
would you be thrilled ?
she stood there looking so confused .
the nurses ran the baby over to the table and called a code .
even worse is that the same thing happened to my cousin .
she insisted i drive myself ( which did n't make sense ) .
in other words , an order was n't even placed until i arrived .
even worst , it did n't arrive until 9pm .
i recently stopped going here after _num_ years .
_num_ weeks in advance , arranged for time off from work , etc .
the front desk is defensive and rude from the start .
not exaggerating , and not a soul in that office ever apologized .
lousy !
i could not sit or walk without extreme pain .
i could not nurse or care for my baby .
she is too busy for you at the very least and incompetent at best .
please consider my story in your decision .
this is the worst medical practice i have ever been to .
i shrugged this off as just an off day for him .
this is the worst experience i ever had in my life .
Positive
she has a beyond negative bedside manner .
it 's such a better experience if you feel someone actually cares about you .
big mistake .
this woman is a poor representation of the medical community .
aside from the fact that my freaking blood tests showed it was low ?
it 's not going to help with weight loss , or anything like that .
but hey , sleep is important too , so that 's okay . ''
i could not believe my ears .
i think she 's the most unprofessional physician i 've ever encountered .
you would be better off going to a free clinic .
they proceeded to tell me that she would speak to me at my appointment .
and , i always get a return call within _num_ hours .
she was short and rude .
every time i call the front desk is nothing but rude and unprofessional .
put in emails and calls but no response from management .
so she refused to put me on anything .
she certainly did not deny me the option to be on it .
to my surprise , i was denied this again .
worst experience ever .
the guy working there had the worst attitude , very unwelcoming location .
just walked in and he had a very unpleasant manor .
they are ridiculously small i ca n't fit any of my dishes in them .
now many months later the whole building is getting treated again for bed bugs .
my lease can not be over soon enough !
pathetic !
and kept the $ _num_ deposit .
there are many other places to live with much cheaper rent prices .
goodbye rancho sierra , you wo n't be missed .
the cabinets and everything are all at least 15-20 years old and very outdated .
horrible move out fees ( scam ) .
old and run down apartments .
never patronizing this store again .
the nurses are rude and complain about actually doing their jobs .
very frustrating to say the least .
i had to reschedule all three of my appointments and miss work each time .
they made me feel like a number and not a valued patient .
bad customer service .
sit there naked in a gown for an hour and a half ?
no thanks !
i can not stand office staff .
they seen arrogant and occasionally rude .
there is always really long wait time .
i wish i could give less than one star .
i 'm glad i will never go back to her clinic .
i would not recommend this office .
she took down my info and i never heard from her .
when i emailed laura , she responded however never got back to me either .
i am tired of dealing with this billing department !
complete rip off .
i do n't think so , not even close .
take your business and hard earned cash somewhere else .
they were rude and condescending .
however , the follow-up and communication from this office are absolutely horrible and unprofessional .
find someone better !
like most doctors offices , they asked me to arrive _num_ minutes early .
do n't go here .
she pretty much did not want to deal with me .
after that visit i never went back .
i , in the meantime needed to get in myself and scheduled an appointment .
the doctor was nice however , the staff is not friendly and or attentive .
i am pretty much fed up with this offices lack of professionalism and courtesy .
extremely dissapointed does n't begin to describe my feelings at this point .
too fancy for a doctor 's office .
no follow-up .
so , i went ahead made an appointment .
no follow-up .
you do n't even have to call me .
maybe it 's nothing .
apparently , billing is slow , too .
even that small amount makes me feel ripped for the complete lack of care .
i 've been trying to call all day and am getting a busy signal .
this location in particular , was a huge disappointment .
thanks but no thanks .
this is not whole foods !
but , no .
i will find the item elsewhere and i wo n't be back .
whole foods could care less .
this manager should have handled this situation in a more professional manner .
bottom line , i will not ever return to this store !
i love whole foods ... but this location is seriously lacking .
they saw us , said `` we will be with in a bit . ''
ordered _num_ sandwiches to take on a plane .
in the future i will stick to the whole foods on mayo blvd !
this place is a cheese ball version of the scottsdale store .
it should n't even be called by the same name .
the service here has really gone downhill .
he was in such a rush that he could n't bag our groceries properly .
it 's too bad .
( curly , blonde hair ) .
he is terrible and gives whole foods a bad name .
this whole foods is soooooo disappointing !
in chicago , i went once a week and everything lasted the week .
_num_ % percent of what i buy is organic produce .
please note i am also a stock holder !
they just do n't have the shelf space .
they just do n't have the customer turnover .
weak .
i was just standing there waiting to be acknowledged .
super bowl sunday was ruined .
i know and like whole foods , but this place is terrible .
as a breakfast option : not fresh , low fruit selection , expensive .
they are rude , no customer service , barely acknowledge me being there .
this is literally the worst whole foods i have ever been to !
the cashiers are extremely unfriendly .
on top of that , this whole foods seems to need a major reno .
i left with a splitting headache and felt sick to my stomach .
very disappointing .
needless to say , i will not be making a trip back .
everything looked worn and dingy and we left after about fifteen minutes .
we are back from a disappointing trip to imagination avenue .
everything looked old , dirty , and used .
it gets crowded in no time , and there is minimal seating for parents .
went based on the great reviews and was a bit disappointed .
the play area is small and dirty feeling .
the cashier was rude also .
wo n't go again .
also , i do n't get what 's so great about this place .
it 's dirty , crazy and nothing very interesting .
good concept but does n't deliver .
nope , too many other cool spots in the valley for kids .
that being said , i do n't think we 'll ever return .
value of the spa pedicure is awful .
$ _num_ tip ) and feel completely ripped off .
messed up polish on _num_ of my toes .
sucks as a phone .
i ca n't wait to get rid of it and possible verizon too .
the customer service at this place is awful .
terrible customer service !
rude , terrible customer service .
wanted nothing to do with me since all i needed was a phone case .
probably could have upgraded my phone .
i wish i could give zero stars .
she was just lazy .
i will never return to this location and i urge you to find another .
horrible customer service .
i suggest if you want to stay with verizon to pick a different store .
i 'm giving this store one star as zero is not an option .
i waited for _num_ minutes before greg came to assist me .
any man that screams at a woman clearly has major issues .
literally the worst customer service ever .
verizon , overall , is a complete joke .
they are not at all concerned about their customers .
i wish i could give them a _num_ !
at this point i just about lost it .
instead of going off on everyone there i just turned around and left .
if you are in to that , this is your store .
verizon sucks but they are all pretty much the same .
avoid this place if at all possible .
_num_ trips ; _num_ nightmares .
it takes a lot for me to write a bad review on yelp .
it 's a complete piece of junk .
at least it worked on wifi before .
they have not made us happy .
if you like getting ripped off and buying sick fish be my guess .
btw , some of their fish do n't have a _num_ day warranty .
if they die , your out of $ $ $ .
a yellow tang cost $ _num_ for a small size .
i wo n't be coming back .
overpriced and slow service .
they just lost my money cause no one would ask if i needed help .
waste of my time .
the last two years have been bad for them .
me : `` no , i 'll just take everything home . ''
me : `` no , i 'll take everything home ! ''
unprofessional .
rude .
waste of time .
they 've lost all possible business from us to say the least .
if i could give it less than _num_ star i would .
the fish die not his .
it was a total biker bar to me .
it 's a small bar with no table serve for drinks .
i do n't believe they had any food .
so freaking crowded you ca n't see the band .
its so loud you cant hear the band .
fire marshall bill would close the place .
so over capacity you ca n't move .
need to stop ticket sales while there is still room to move .
will not be going back !
this bar sucks , i would n't waste my time if i were you .
bartenders are also not cool .
my boyfriend was in extreme pain and the customer service was atrocious .
i really do n't know how this place has such great reviews .
i walked in on friday night to order takeout .
it looked like she was even serving on the floor at times .
prices were okay , but the food was n't anything to write home about .
gross ... .
zero stars !
it was over cooked , dry and barely edible .
that was my first experience , should have learned my lesson .
so i gave it a second chance this new years _num_ .
i had no problem with that , it was new years .
by the way , the restaurant had maybe _num_ tables with people .
not slammed , and still no one waiting for a table .
the chicken was dry , with very little sauce .
basically did n't eat it .
good food only goes so far ... shady business of shady business .
minus _num_ stars for being sketchy .
i showed up _num_ minutes before close time and the doors were shit .
reviews were ok ... but those people must not have taste buds !
she said this is a really rude manner like i was bothering her .
i said , `` i just need an appointment !
she then rudely told me that nothing was available until the end of august .
i just said thanks anyway and she hung up .
i am not returning .
the woman at the desk knew i was upset and was annoyed by that .
neither my husband nor myself will return to this practice .
my concerns were never addressed .
i do n't know that anything can be done .
very sad i did n't research more .
i really liked dr. holy , but her office professionalism is horrible .
shame on you !
inspector did not test or visually inspect a/c unit .
his report said because exterior temp was too cold , it was _num_ .
very disappointed and would not recommend .
was not very happy .
laundry room destroyed , floor destroyed , ceiling and walls destroyed .
please accept it as a zero !
did not catch smallest problems to biggest and very expensive problems .
feast of the middle east _num_ : here is my experience there .
maybe i just hit the nasty group of the church ?
now i see why everyone was in their seats at _num_ pm talking .
they were waiting for the show to start and know how limited seating is .
i brought in a microwave oven for someone to look at here .
i could tell that he never looked at my microwave .
dishonest !
real high and he stated next time it would be higher .
and online for $ _num_ .
they would not let me return the part even with the invoice .
i will never return to this store .
a total of _num_ pieces of plastic .
so $ _num_ vs. $ _num_ .
i did n't look at the reviews until i had this horrific experience .
door would n't spring open when open button pushed .
new springs were $ _num_ online , but probably only needed adjustment .
they were soo rude and did n't give a crap about the customer .
stay away and let all your friends know to not shop here !
dishonest !
i 'll never consider going back .
dishonest - cant give zero stars so i give one .
very dishonest and not ethical .
very disappointed !
yep , they got their money and my $ _num_ .
communication was horrible .
i can not begin to express how poorly i think of corporate office centers .
the staff is trained to make money , not to help tenants .
finally , after ending my lease , i was billed !
the same incompetent workers are somehow still working at this location .
the asian man is extremely rude and does not listen to anyone .
i would not recommend this school based on my experience .
in my opinion , mr. brown is the most expensive attorney on the planet .
wish i would have used someone else for my business .
this place is awesome if you want to wear your food .
actually , that might be better than eating it .
this place is a far cry from what it used to be .
i walked in and the store looked half empty .
the selection was dreadful .
the customer service here is terrible and they make you feel really stupid .
avoid it if you can .
tonight 's pizza was just a mess .
half went to the trash .
i ca n't believe i actually like this stuff as a kid .
was it always this bad ?
Neutral
i wish i could get a negative star to this pizza hut .
tonight was an absolutely horrible experience .
then , insult to injury , our wings were short !
too because they were missing .
so , i called this store and talked to their `` manager '' crystal .
my latest experience with this pizza hut was almost something to laugh at .
anyhow , we changed our minds and stated that it was for pickup .
ok , really ?
if i could rate _num_ i would .
i could n't eat it .
this bashas is really annoying .
feel something dripping down your leg ?
totally never coming back to this or any bashas store .
i noticed a plastic container with cheese samples .
when i returned home , i was going to make a sandwich .
the roast beef had an odd taste and upset my stomach .
okay store , they do n't offer double coupons , only at face value .
terrible !
rude and expensive .
it does n't get any worse .
very dissappointed .
i would not recommend this dry cleaner .
extremely poor customer service .
the service is even worse than usual .
to-go orders regularly screwed up .
better food , better prices .
food service is rather slow .
both times the waitress did not pay enough attention to our table .
the wings come out very dry .
a freaking nickel short .
there was n't much meat in the sandwich , and it lacked cheese .
i told them no onions and yet onions were still sprinkled throughout the sandwich .
the prices were kind of high and the place was extremely dirty .
never had a problem until tonight .
after years of patronage , i wo n't be back for a while .
indifferent food , atrocious service .
the kids meals are like $ _num_ each !
husband and i stopped today for lunch .
halfway thru my 2nd piece , a cockroach runs across our table .
do n't think that i will go back .
i really hate writing this review .
this last time i was there was a total disappointment .
i handed the server the card when i ordered .
wo n't be around much longer with how things are going .
but my _num_ meat white pizza was missing meat !
thought this would be perfect .
they raised beer prices by a quarter big deal .
i actually use to really like this place .
like tonight , for example .
needless to say , the evening continued .
there goes my appetite !
serves with mediocre at best .
not good !
long story short .
not impressed with the service or the pizza .
i was craving some wings and pizza and we were in the neighborhood .
_num_ minutes roll around and no appetizer !
plus my husband was out of water and she had n't come around .
and when i say loud , i mean loud .
but that 's not what bothered me .
boy was i wrong .
his pizza came out with barbeque sauce instead of buffalo .
regardless of the fact that we did n't eat it that 's still disgusting .
no , i will not give this place another try .
sorry , uncle sam 's .
it was a very small cockroach but still it was super gross .
how much worse can you get ?
the servers are all young , cute girls but have n't properly been trained .
i wo n't go back .
i always order the same thing , mushroom pepper cheesesteak and hot wings .
tasted like can and jar ingredients and was cold on the inside .
their cheese steak sandwich was terrible .
meat and cheese and bread and a hint of sauce .
barely any cheese and almost no sauce .
paid $ _num_ for _num_ inches of bleh .
unfortunately we have decided that the third time is not the charm .
Neutral
negative : the food sounds good but does n't deliver you to flavor town .
the menu does n't describe the items well .
raw chicken is never good .
the service is now awful .
rude waitresses that make you wait forever .
not to mention the food has severely gone downhill .
today 's lunch service was worst ever .
waitress was slow to get to our table and the drinks got there slowly .
we waited for _num_ minutes for food that was cold and over cooked .
the manager was apologetic but we left without eating .
we will not be back .
gave it another shot .
it 's my fault , i should have checked .
i have been going to uncle sams for many years .
we went to dinner there last night and it was horrible .
she ate _num_ % of it .
there were _num_ other occupied tables , more staff than customers .
ate half of my husbands sandwich .
for the 1st time in my life i sent my food back .
one bite told me otherwise .
the sandwich had absolutely no flavor , nothing .
no cheese taste , no onion taste .
meat was it , meat with no salt , no pepper .
poor service and horrible food .
would not surprise me to see this place shut its doors .
so save your time and money and go elsewhere .
uncle sam 's cheese steaks are great ... but do n't try anything else .
i had two bites and threw it away .
may not be back for awhile .
worst food i 've ever had .
overpriced and below average food .
we obviously chose uncle sams , which ended up being the wrong choice .
only _num_ other tables when we came in .
ordered our drinks than our meals .
never offered a refill on the water my girlfriend was drinking or another beer .
food is awful .
had a cheese steak sandwich , it was dry and cold .
do not go here .
no call back !
i hated it .
that 's not a big deal if it 's not busy .
it was so dry and was something i would never want to get again .
mashed potatoes & gravy in one container ?
the only thing good was the corn on the cob !
this location sucks .
never going back .
my order started off with a broken ordering speaker .
major customer service fail .
too pricey for the food .
they were also not too happy to see my two kids in tow .
our third time here was not a charm !
my fiance and i tried the place because of a groupon .
there is nothing eye catching about the business front at all .
we were greeted by friendly gentleman who seated us on the main lower floor .
no beer list , no soda list , no liquid period .
more lack of information from the menu .
it is terribly outdated .
we did not take our leftovers .
what a miserable experience !
the service was terrible and the food was below average .
the waiter said that nobody else complained about it .
so disappointed !
so i asked , how is your halibut ?
to which i received a quick , no .
the halibut was almost without salt .
i might even venture to say that it had no salt .
any food without salt is tasteless .
i really hate tasteless fish .
the chicken had no salt , the eggplant in it had no salt .
not so my dear , not so .
otherwise , it was a disappointing meal for both of us .
never going back .
service extremely slow .
very noisy .
was very busy sat .
we waited another _num_ minutes for him to return which never happened .
btw , the server was an older gentleman , gray hair .
i would not recommend this place ... ridiculous customer service .
a few others have mentioned that they felt ignored we must agree .
very poor quality wash .
bad news for any regulars here .
they 've sold and are operating under arizona car wash .
bobby is also no longer there .
bad vacuum .
time to find a new car wash .
went through the drive thru pharmacy the past two times .
had to wait at least _num_ minutes both times .
staff is poorly equipped to communicate with humans and discuss child care with parents .
paperwork was a nightmare .
topping that all off - today they lost my kid .
she apparently missed both days of training in both communication and service .
the service is terrible , and very overpriced for the apparent value .
this was absolutely ridiculous since the sweater is brand new !
the manager did not even say i 'm sorry .
he only said he ca n't help me .
they did n't even offer to refund the fee for the dry cleaning .
i had my $ _num_ pottery barn faux fur blanket cleaned here .
i will not use this cleaners and do not recommend them .
i am currently _num_ weeks pregnant .
again , they were courteous and very careful in the handling of our furniture .
but they were the slowest movers i 've ever used .
worst customer service ever .
he also refused to help us because of this .
my rating is zero stars .
therefore , i chose the flat rate , which was $ _num_ .
it always has looked a bit picked over .
employees are rude with a capitol r !
dumb policies , bad management .
why not have a bigger room ?
why not have it a couple times ?
worse experience than the dmv .
battery is dead and needs to be replaced .
guess what , they do n't have a battery to replace this one .
the girl i spoke to on the phone , offered to tow our truck .
terrible .
some of the worst service and worst pizza i 've ever had .
i can sum up red devil in a single word : disappointing .
this is very disappointing , we used to love red devil so much .
then it took a turn for the worse .
every plate was drowning in marinara sauce .
to add insult to injury , the prices were absurd !
the pizza is okay , but expensive .
the bill came to just under $ _num_ .
not worth it for a very average lunch .
the pizza was gross .
we tried to get away from the typical chains and tried this place .
the pizza crust was tasteless , soggy and gross !
so weird , wo n't be back .
another boy came out and also gave us dirty looks .
the last time i came here for lunch it was a disaster .
the pizza was super slow and when it finally arrived it was burnt .
poor service .
this place was not good .
pretty bland it must have been what i ordered .
first time and last .
ordered a large pizza w/ pepperoni sausage and mushroom and an order of lasagna .
pizza crust was very thin and not what i was expecting .
mushrooms were fresh but for an $ _num_ pizza i was expecting better .
cardboard crust pizza .
umm , no thanks .
two different cocktails ... tasted exactly the same ... .
and not good .
the food was very below average .
we had bruschetta , and pizza along with spaghetti with clam sauce .
will definitely not be going back .
gross !
walked in here and it was totally dead .
we were excited to try the pizza !
both were rubbery and fake tasting .
they were all basic things that a restaurant should have on a saturday night .
it was that bad !
i want my $ _num_ back !
my salad with italian dressing was ok .
nothing special .
dining companions caesar - said it was salty - almost inedible .
horrible .
lasagna taste bad .
chicken tenders were cold and mushy .
she shook her head `` no '' at me and walked away .
have been going to rd for quite sometime .
went this evening ... our server chelsea was not that with it .
but honestly ... service to me is a deal breaker .
our bill was close to $ _num_ .
never offered water or bread and just not impressed .
it was horrible !
however , going in and asking for a specific dress they do n't have ?
so annoying .
plus their accessories are so expensive , and very cookie cutter .
the level of service is not that great .
this was never mentioned until the last moment when paying for the dress .
i mean , does she not realize that this is my wedding ?
staff was not good and very unprofessional looking employees .
do not go to the pv location go somewhere else .
we walked around for nearly _num_ minutes after the appointment was booked .
so that was frustrating .
because she had only pulled one dress we were just standing around .
so we left feeling completely unsatisfied .
this was the first place i went to try on dresses .
the store was totally empty except for us and i had an appointment .
so , that alone made the dresses look weird .
so i tried on a couple dresses , but was n't really feeling them .
she refused .
ridiculous !
this sure as hell is not the way to sell dresses .
after that move , i was done .
i would not recommend this to anyone .
they do not hire any competent people what so ever ... even their managers .
so first off you need to make an appointment for david 's bridal really ?
we then set up appointments for alterations .
i wish i could give them _num_ stars .
i was frustrated but understood them not having all the sizes i needed .
not sure .
this was not great information or service .
i left feeling unimpressed .
i hope i have a better experience then .
i received a confirmation for sunday at 12:30 and we went .
the experience was n't that great .
not all fit in the tiny room they give you .
at one point i was switching the dresses out myself .
with the discount from their advertised sale it would have been $ _num_ .
will not go here again or suggest anyone else do so .
the warehouse takes _num_ weeks to ship !
it would arrive _num_ days before the wedding , but that was not guaranteed .
which caused another problem since we could n't get the purple we wanted .
finally after _num_ hours we were ready to check out .
the original consultant had put everything in wrong .
my mom was assigned a dress she never tried on .
it took forever to fix .
no , i 'm sorry were given .
no here 's a coupon for your trouble .
instead here 's a _num_ dollar charge per item to ship .
i am completely unsatisfied with they service at this store .
if i could give no stars i would .
it was a disappointing experience .
i also was n't impressed by the dresses .
there was one that was so-so , though it did n't fit quite right .
ummmm , no .
all in all , i had much better experiences at other bridal shops .
had better luck at focus and they were nice and same shoes for _num_ !
( maybe she was n't up to par on her commission paycheck . )
wrong .
katie was helpful though and patient as any bridal consultant should be .
i wish i could give this place _num_ stars .
rude , unhelpful staff who pays very little attention to detail .
in reality , i had been given her dress earlier in the day .
when i called to speak to a manager i was hung up on .
this place is gross .
horrible customer service !
i will not spend another dime in this store .
i wish i had taken my dress somewhere else .
are you kidding me ?
i had maybe lost _num_ dress sizes .
i did n't even bother .
this store gives zero in customer service !
why sell something your sales staff can not show how to wear it ?
i refused to give this store any sale for their lack of service !
the sales team at this store is incredibly incompetent .
although we had an appointment , our sales rep kept forgetting about us .
we had to wait _num_ minutes after checking in .
it was ridiculous .
she said that the file indicated my daughter would need a size _num_ .
i 'm going to spend hundreds of dollars on these two dresses + alterations .
never use the alterations department at david 's bridal at paradise valley !
better yet , just stay away from the whole store .
she should not be working with people .
it looked horrible , and it obviously did n't look like my body .
then she made the dress sooo tight , i could not breathe .
then her boss handed me my bill for $ _num_ .
i left , and my dress was all wrong .
she was sooo mad , i thought we were going to go to blows .
the whole experience was a nightmare !
i was made to believe i was in the wrong place .
i wish i had been .
what a waste of time .
maybe they should not double book or hire more staff .
do not do business with these people .
when they came in march of _num_ , i sent my regular payment .
i guess once they had my extra money i would never see it again .
shame on these people and how they run their business .
we were told `` no , store policy is no refunds !
he said no you can have a store credit but no money back .
really bad customer service .
also quite rude when i called .
i would not go here searching for funky , colorful fabrics for your home !
wow do i hate old navy .
they have the most awful colored clothing ever .
holy crap .
i used a restaurant.com coupon and wish i had n't .
dumpy , bad service , worst food .
( waitress proceeds to tell me this is cheaper then buying the wing plate .
total _num_ for _num_ wings and _num_ kids hopped up on dr pepper .
i ordered the _num_ for _num_ wings .
and _num_ waters .
the salads we ok the dressings were ok .
this was not even that good .
that is about _num_ cents more then was deserved .
im only giving _num_ start because i ca n't give _num_ .
the waitress was pleasant and extremely helpful , but not dressed appropriately .
we did not feel safe eating it .
and we were not thrilled but then it got worse .
it 's just rough .
the burger i had was bland .
no seasoning at all .
filthy , smelled horrid , gross .
hubby ordered hot pastrami sandwich , he said was fine .
however it took over _num_ minutes just to get our order taken .
another _num_ minutes after that our order was taken .
others who had came after we did were being brought food .
the wings tastes awful and the fries were clearly frozen store bought .
the place still smelled like rotten feet .
will not go back !
ok breakfast for the money .
older place with a little bit of a smell to it but friendly service .
i lost a big part of my appetite when i received my order .
the plate was dirty , underneath , on the back of the plate .
probably not .
worst experience we ever had !
would not recommend this restaurant .
we were not rude , loud or inappropriate with any one !
it took _num_ minutes to get my order .
it took nearly _num_ minutes to get my order .
it took _num_ minutes to get my order .
so i took a bite from the other side with the same results .
even it i chose to attempt to eat it , it was physically impossible .
it is also worth mentioning that it is very sloppy work .
save your energy and take your money elsewhere .
they did n't even advise the correct way to fill tanks .
we do n't need this type of store in a nice family area .
i said , `` so you admit you sell crap ? ''
do n't think you are getting a good deal .
like the owner said , it 's crap !
if you 're going to sell crap , at least stand behind your products .
it came with a `` too bad so sad '' attitude .
too many other options these days .
talk about bad business !
how did this place get _num_ stars ?
the work was to be completed by end of dec _num_ .
it was finally delivered on feb _num_ , _num_ .
people are not honest and has the worst customer service .
this would have given me time to go to a different vendor .
they assured us that it would be no problem .
their were only _num_ employees , and were very under staffed .
ugh .
worst sandwich ever !
i like they are local to arizona though so we 'll stay !
we are still trying to get all our money back .
updated since they did finally give our money back .
so for _num_ business days i had no money .
even though it has cleared , i ca n't even touch my own money .
who fucking cares if i am new .
Positive
i would for sure give this place and their employees a negative rating .
do not go to this place .
none of these people know what the fuck they are doing .
the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing !
a lousy $ _num_ dollar check .
why was it so confusing ?
i wish i could give this place zero stars !
so i just went to my credit union for that enormous deposit .
no phone call ever received .
so i emailed them , also no response .
never , never again !
the absolute worst in customer service !
i made the mistake of going in while she was at lunch !
but no one else could help me .
but instead i get to wait in a long line .
what kind of bank does n't have a _num_ hour help center ?
i know i did n't spend $ _num_ all in one day .
i 'm making sure everyone knows how i feel about this credit union .
_num_ minutes later your 're free to leave with your receipt .
getting them to do a batch deposit is a nightmare !
if you want a better banking experience for your business , go to chase .
they randomly will update their online banking without any notice .
kinda sucks when you need to know how much is in your account .
truly the worst customer service i have ever experienced .
what a giant mistake .
this is the single worst customer experience i have ever received .
now that does n't work so i have no use for this credit union .
they are difficult to work with , the employees hardly know anything about finance .
this credit union is pathetic and never bank with them .
i hate to say it but wells fargo makes this place look bad .
Negative
if i could give a negative star i would .
useless company and a waste of my time .
stay clear -- this is my experience with desert schools .
i 'm making sure everyone knows how i feel about this credit union .
horrible .
money was sitting in the account and in the meantime my mortgage was late .
this has happened _num_ times .
_num_ times .
account numbers and account holder names sitting all over christopher the teller 's desk .
just nasty !
i just grab it and pay for it .
however , my low rating is based on what i experienced here recently .
there was no definition or depth or any kind of contrast .
i was very disappointed with my face when she finished .
i have never felt so uncomfortable at a mac store before .
do n't waste your time.
i have nothing against walmart , but this place needs to be closed .
the restroom was absolutely unacceptable .
it takes me _num_ minutes to track down a manager .
i did not catch his name but everyone at this store is completely incompetent !
avoid this store if possible !
hands down the worst wal-mart i ever been in .
i feel sorry for anyone actually buying so call fresh food there .
embarrassment - every single time .
it was so bad that my daughter told me she was scared .
customers were staring , the employees did nothing .
i 'm glad to see it 's being renovated .
same goes for this walmart .
i said , `` excuse me '' several times but was ignored .
i hate this walmart and i would rather pay double somewhere else .
the employees are not interested in helping customers .
overall , it could be a lot better .
but i was amazed at how poor the service was .
workers yelling down aisles .
zero sense of urgency to complete a sale .
worst customer service !
went to return a storage box that did not fit our christmas tree .
another thing is she should have dropped the attitude right from the beginning .
this was one of the worst customer service experiences i 've ever had !
that did n't do me any good .
horrible customer service .
i hate coming to walmart for this reason !
naked children in the street , bike wheels are too big .
lady at the door looks like she 's gon na cry .
produce has rotten fruits n veggies , grocery had out of date products .
to remind myself of how better i am , i guess .
Negative
i would put negative star if available .
the workers their are so rude ave are not costumer friendly .
not to mention they do n't even know their own merchandise .
thumbs down twice !
i try to understand why people can be so rude .
but to be rude over and over again is just unacceptable .
this was after waiting _num_ minutes to get someone to the electronic area .
we hand to hunt down workers _num_ times .
how ever , all the cashiers seem to have the worst days ever .
another day my boyfriend went in to purchase a new razor .
this was around _num_ pm .
i ca n't find the key , walked away and never came back .
he waited _num_ minutes thinking someone would be coming back with the appropriate key .
avoid at all costs .
zero if i could .
horrible customer service .
i never ever gon na order photo prints from here .
just another reason to hate walmart .
probably will get a raise with this bad review !
drive _num_ more minutes .
just left this walmart and i am so disgusted .
literally zero customer service .
did n't seem fresh at all and just soggy .
this place used to be really awesome back in the day .
now it sucks .
maybe others are better but this location is no bueno .
not very knowledgeable staff !
i dont really like it and there are better options for chinese fast food .
but they are fast and cheap which is why i usually order from them .
even the sesame chicken .
i support small business , this owner will not get mine .
this nail place is terrible .
theres one across the parking lot that at least doesnt change prices on you .
i was a walk-in for a pedicure and was treated well .
if i would have know this , i would n't have gone in .
had oil changed here yesterday .
i will not go here again !
they attempted to charge me for things i did not need .
the mechanic shrugged it off .
oh , and there is no air conditioning .
i was very clear that i only wanted an oil change .
i will not be back .
this use to be my favorite jiffy lube until today .
so this caught me by surprise and asked why so long .
then _num_ minutes later my vehicle was ready .
overall it was _num_ minutes like normal .
not friendly , actually rude .
i wo n't come back .
i got here _num_ minutes ago with only one other car here .
does n't give them an excuse to mess up my order !
long story short i made the drive back so my kid got his food .
i was told the prices were good and the sales people were knowledgeable .
we walked around for about _num_ minutes without any sales person assisting us .
during that time two additional customers walked in and were attended to promptly .
i thought that was reasonable so i said no problem .
truly a disappointing experience .
the worst dentist i have ever been too .
he is not qualified to do anything other than general dentistry .
his wife runs the office also and she is pushy and offensive .
very annoying !
going to this dentist was a horrible experience .
they are not qualified to do anything other than general dentistry .
the entire experience was a nightmare .
his wife also runs the front desk and she is rude and offensive .
boring .
_num_ ) cash only or maybe there was a minimum .
there is a sort of visible sign that you may or may not notice .
i just did n't really find any good points .
it 's basically a hole in the wall that has live music .
everybody will know your name , though .
very very odd place .
will not be returning , extremely loud , forget having a conversation with anyone .
he should not be in management position .
what type of torture does he put them through ?
half price books is way over rated .
it still does n't register .
no light bulb .
i 'm not making this up .
never sell anything to this place , they will rip you off .
i unfortunately did not enjoy my experience here .
one of the men said sorry , that they were telling jokes .
i was not happy with the cleanliness , professionalism , or their manner .
ever .
that 's not cool .
but like i said , no thanks .
all three were bad experiences .
_num_ .
about _num_ minutes later , a lady walked in asking for a full set .
they asked if she had an appointment , she said she did n't .
i , however , continued to sit and not be helped or spoken to .
but i was very annoyed at the whole situation .
_num_ .
i went in by myself for my birthday present to get a pedicure .
he was very rough with my feet .
_num_ .
i went back a week later for a gel manicure .
unfortunately i had the same guy as my previous experience .
no apologies .
i noticed him staring at me .
it was just a very uncomfortable experience .
in the end , it forced me to find a new nail salon .
they do n't listen and over charge !
again pedicure was horrible and expensive .
the young guy is always so rude .
i asked him to file down my nails .
they are so crooked it 's not even funny !
waist of my time and another $ _num_ !
not sure i would even give this place a _num_ star .
it 's the worse pedicure i have ever had !
horrible pedicure !
needless to say i am way more than unhappy with today 's experience .
this is disgusting and i wo n't be back .
and i was n't happy with the manicure or pedicure .
the pedicure was done within _num_ mins .
nothing extra was done that i ca n't do myself at home really !
and i am not even trained in these stuff .
the guy had really long nails and hurt me around 4-5 times with them .
the products being used seem not of good quality .
did n't feel like any professional was doing it .
i used to come here all the time .
so i left .
horrible experience .
two of us had made appointments for _num_ manicures .
_num_ pedicures .
we sat in a foot bath for almost _num_ minutes .
it took us nearly _num_ 1/2 hours for very basic services .
we even heard the owner go out back and scream !
typical low class residents , guests and especially `` management '' .
they will try to get $ $ from you anyway they can .
i have to agree with the _num_ guys that gave this place _num_ star .
the management is horrible they will never take any responsibility if something happens !
this is actually the worst american eagle i have been to .
there were _num_ associates on the floor .
neither acknowledged me in any way shape or form while i was there .
the manager lady was pretty rude today .
ca n't even get records without a $ _num_ per page fee .
my husband and i were patients for decades , things went slowly downhill .
it is getting tough to find good doctors , sadly .
they are out there , if you look very hard .
plus you get complimentary training sessions .
and he went on for about _num_ minutes .
too bad i ca n't say the same in this review .
walked in with no greeting and no one in the aisle to help customers .
i also did n't think the selection for bridal shower items was very impressive .
no further questions ... .
no `` let me ask a manager '' .
we obviously purchased from them , we had their tank .
big surprise , no phone call !
if i could give this store an even lower rating i would .
the staff however , exceptionally rude to the point i called corporate .
on my way home from the pv area i stopped at this party city .
i told her _num_ ( four ) people had told me it was ok .
i wait in line and i get to a male cashier .
he says `` no no no all sales final . ''
does n't even say a word to me .
but of the _num_ people i dealt with only one was nice to me .
rude and unhelpful employees .
this place was the worst !
i will not return here nor will i reccomend it !
i walked it with _num_ bags full .
i stayed to wait it out .
big mistake !
instead they proceeded to talk crap about the lady that just left !
i do n't care '' hello !
i hate this store and the one on bell !
i would not suggest other mothers .
i should have listened to the other reviews and stayed away .
horrible customer service .
i 'm not even sure where to start with the complaints !
first off , my boy is now _num_ 1/2 .
i do n't think i 've ever had a pleasant experience here .
pathetic right ?
horrible !
in january , they still had not repaired it .
when i tried explaining my case to the manager , he was beyond rude !
throughout the whole conversation , he was extremely sarcastic , condescending and unprofessional .
it did n't seem like she even knew what she was talking about .
not professional , not friendly , not helpful .
i will not be returning to this location .
not really what i would consider a good experience with this business .
i was surprise with your answer toward a customer like me .
even the girl behind the desk was shock with your answer toward me .
thank you again for the worst service my friend .
i would never deal with your company again .
well i guess i sucked up rocks , and that was it .
never rent from these people .
may i repeat myself , never rent from this business .
horrible customer service .
this place is mediocre at best .
now the sauce has no taste and the crust is thick and doughy .
ca n't tell the difference between the box and the pizza .
the wings alone are _num_ even .
i just want less pizza for the same price .
or is there something i am not understanding in the pizza industry ?
the mushrooms were canned and there was no flavor .
my husband and i stopped in _num_ minutes before close one evening .
the mushrooms were artificial and straight out of a slimy can .
the crust was under cooked and forgettable .
the only ingredient that was worth a darn was the sauce .
needless to say we 'll try the place again .
ordered a pizza and their pizza fries for pick up tonight .
email says it takes about _num_ mins .
fast forward _num_ mins after seeing people come and go .
got home , pizza was stone cold .
first time i ordered a dozen wings , and they gave me _num_ .
the second time i ordered _num_ wings and they gave me _num_ .
their counting skills are horrible .
there are so many good pizza joints out they 're , go with them .
the manager obliged , but there was no apology for the poor service .
so really , there 's no excuse .
even the boyfriend said he 'd never go back .
tried to up charge me for everything because i had a coupon .
not polite management .
pizza was okay ... ... gross pizza ever salad was old nasty ... .
i do n't understand how anyone can say this pizza is good .
the most disgusting pizza i have ever eaten .
i mean how do you mess up pizza though .
ate half of it and threw the rest away .
their water is cold .
there are too many other dog washes to go through that again .
never go here .
stick with sams club .
i ordered _num_ goodyear tires .
_num_ more months pass and my front tire keeps leaking air .
they want me to buy a new tire .
they take out the nail and leave me hanging with my spare tire .
i am never going here again .
their warranty does n't cover anything and do n't buy it .
in addition stick to places like sam 's club .
so , i 've been to this location _num_ times .
sadly , each time has been a struggle .
i went to this location and was going to pay asap .
recently , we needed to get new tires on one of our cars .
then he said `` glad you came back '' and disappeared out the door .
so , why say you remember me if you honestly do n't ?
i never `` asked '' for a free tire , it was offered .
it 's not rocket science , and it 's not apparent at discount tire .
this is something this discount tire location ca n't seem to manage .
the worst staff ever .
only to find it was on the second floor with no elevator .
to over-priced and annoying for me to come in again .
i had the most horrible shopping experience here today .
i was so livid i threw the jeans down and walked out .
completely ignored at pv and there selection was poor .
it was n't horrible but i wo n't be back .
very hard to read , red tags with back ink and so warn .
taking cash only was the last kick to get us out the door .
we walked through the front door , immediately got upset .
place is so small and has no selection .
they did n't even have bread for sale !
_num_ ) the insurance they sell is almost worthless .
the web rate for the same unit was $ _num_ a month .
_num_ ) the security on the units without a roll up door is abysmal .
my kid could probably climb into a unit on the top floor .
sorry , i must had gone in at the wrong time .
sprint will not let us out of our contract .
we spent hours on hold just to have the calls dropped .
i was really upset and could n't believe that this was so difficult .
i ca n't believe that this person is in customer service .
he is an idiot and should be fired .
i 'm not sure if anything will be done about it .
not to mention messing up payments and bills .
tonight , however , i 'm livid .
no luck .
no , i 'd rather not waste my money .
sprint and their employees are useless .
horrible coverage , horrible customer service !
sprint salesman are worse then used car sales man .
no way it was going to work for me .
customer service - terrible !
_num_ months i dealt with their customer service .
i hate this company .
horrible in store experienced .
crappy customer service .
rude employees .
waited _num_ minutes for my damn free phone .
if lowes was closer , i would rarely come to this store .
terrible customer service .
_num_ . )
he repeatedly told me how much longer it takes him to complete the return .
_num_ . )
that guy was rude , condescending , and short .
_num_ . )
i ca n't just stand here , receipt in hand , for _num_ minute ?
will not return to this location .
they screwed up bad .
well , that does not work .
as far as i am concerned , wo n't start , its defective .
makes no sense at all .
all in all , very bad experience .
Neutral
if i could give negative stars i would do so .
i will be contacting the better business bureau as well to file a complaint .
time to file a complaint and contact _num_ on your side .
after that it went downhill .
she is less than professional .
had already taken the day off so it was a day wasted .
they never have offered for anyone to come inspect .
this home depot has the absolute worst customer service i have ever experienced !
the paint department at this home depot is totally inept any customer service whatsoever .
Negative
i ca n't give a negative rating so i gave a _num_ star rating .
certainly will not be coming back to home depot anytime soon .
complete garbage ... .
what 's a terrible experience i had at this location !
it 's not middle eastern either , this is a gyro joint .
it was tough , not tender and juicy like it should be .
i ate half of it and left the rest .
dessert is where everything goes downhill .
but the turkish coffee was a disaster .
unfortunately , i am usually disappointed .
the term `` leaves a bad taste in your mouth '' is exactly that .
ick .
uh , no .
the entire gyro was drowning in tzatziki .
been here _num_ times ate twice .
the worst lunch i can remember having .
which is sad because pita jungle is hardly mediterranean food .
last night we got our dinner to go , and it was pretty bad .
if we had been dining in , i would have returned it .
the greek fries were soggy and limp , not crisp .
tonight was the last straw .
they did refund my money .
i used to eat here twice a week .
a family runs this place .
noticed the big world 's famous gyro sign out front .
i had the falafel pita sandwich and greek fries .
the fries were nothing special .
the fries themselves were not coated in any sort of spices .
failed to meet my expectations based on the description in the menu .
_num_ ) the space is small and cramped .
there is very little room to move around and it is dark in side .
_num_ ) the food is average .
i love gyros , but theirs is nothing special .
i like my big fat greek restaurant 's more .
terrible food and over priced .
staff is unprofessional and rushed with the customers .
lamb shawarma sold out .
hate it when they run out of food at 1pm .
for over _num_ mins .
terrible .
ordered the chicken shawarma , humus , and roast vegetables .
the humus was awful .
she was losing weight and needed to eat .
our future puppy and our cats will stay clear of this facility .
if i could give this place a zero i would .
they do n't even deserve one star .
the worst customer service i 've had in quite a long time .
the guy was so rude and the quote was beyond outrageous !
they were having a sale and the flooring i like was _num_ % off .
scream and yell in your show room ?
horrible customer service .
the employees do n't care about their job .
the food is disgusting , even down to the watered down soda !
spare yourself , find another venue for a party !
just went to this location and my family and i are very disappointed .
so the soda was watered down , the pizza was greasy and tasteless .
i asked for blue cheese and ranch with my wings and only received ranch .
paid $ _num_ bucks two drinks medium pizza and small wings .
that 's the food experience , will never go back .
simply put , this place is the worst .
rude staff !
terrible customer service .
this place has forever lost my business .
this business is located near my home .
if they do have water , it is also filthy .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
in other words , your customer service stinks buddy .
did not have a good experience here .
i politely said - no thanks .
i worked for a law firm that actually did that .
maybe i should have told my roommate she ca n't go to the hospital .
i have dogs , and my dogs have lots of hair .
also , watch out for the coupon specials .
not going back here again .
terrible experience .
interior was n't complete .
when i pointed out the dirt the attendant handed me a rag .
i purchased a complete interior detail awhile ago after being pressured by the salesman .
it would get done quickly , at most an hour .
he pressured me into purchasing an exterior detail .
the exterior looked the same as it always does after a wash .
i was very disappointed .
they also have zero understanding of customer service .
wo n't waste my money here ever again .
unethical business practices .
i was very unimpressed with the atmosphere , cleanliness , and employees .
i wo n't be taking my kids back , unless i 'm desperate .
i was thoroughly disappointed at the lack of customer service !
who is very unprofessional and no patients with small children anyway .
and now that i look at his hair cut , it 's uneven .
i will just fix it myself instead of going back there .
i wish i had just gone to a regular place .
after 5-10 minutes she came back , but was very impatient .
not to mention , the store is dirty .
my kids love coming here , but sadly this is our last time .
i paid to have my daughters hair dried and they left it wet .
she told me it it more of a finger dry .
how hard is is to call and let me know .
returned on sat .
they were linen , would it have been to much to press ?
i feel sick .
you get what you pay for here , a quick job , no art .
he told me he would try and get it done .
i went in to pick up my shoes and he could not find them .
he then said `` oh well , too bad .
i told him , `` i just want my money back . ''
do not use this `` shoe repair '' .
bad service !
the following saturday i stopped in to pick-up my shoes .
i stopped by the store again finding the shoes were not done .
i suggest everyone not bother him .
can not comment on the quality of the work .
i wish i read the reviews of this place before coming here .
the one he fixed all he had to do was remove some links !
remove some links for $ _num_ ?
i wont be using him again nor do i recommend anyone using him .
do not go to this shoe repair !
i went the next _num_ days and his store was closed !
i let him know that he should not disrespect his customers and left .
dirty table _num_ .
ordered a queso appetizer - the chips were kind of stale .
one of the ladies at our table ordered a chicken salad with raspberry dressing .
the salad presentation was poor .
it was missing walnuts ( which she later brought out ) .
the salad was drenched dressing .
so if you want bar food this is not the place to go .
by the amount of empty seats the problem is your food pricing .
one of the worst customer services i have experienced in awhile .
the waitress did n't seem to care immediately after we got our food .
again still had empty waters and did n't ask if we needed anything else .
if i could give this zero stars , i would .
this was the worst experience i have ever had from a server .
place was your average bar an grill with basic food you would expect .
the burrito again was good but nothing special .
im ok with mistakes as things happen but to act that way was ridiculous .
i would probably not bother coming here again .
her loss since i 'm a server and would have taken care of her .
a little on the expensive side but alright portions .
probably wo n't be going back .
we had a party of _num_ and sat in a corner booth .
we sat for roughly _num_ minutes and was not acknowledged by any staff .
i never had this bad of service here .
i 'm so disappointed in this establishment .
let me just comment on walking in .
the onion rings were pretty decent , nothing special just a normal onion ring .
tender onions for sure , but the ratio between onion and bread sucks .
terrible !
these were not even luke warm .
i would get it again if i ever came back .
this is a big miss .
all in all , i will not be back .
i was not impressed with this place .
$ _num_ for a cheesesteak is way to high for the quality .
i have no idea why this place is so highly rated .
well come to find out the doctor had no record of my visit .
my appointment was for early june to order pick out my glasses .
july comes around and i have yet to hear if my glasses had arrived .
so i knew immediately when i started to get sick .
i would n't go to this one ever again !
this place is horrible !
with each call , i was asked to verify my insurance information .
on the day of the appointment , i arrived fifteen minutes early .
after the phone call she said i was not covered by vision insurance .
alas , i was covered and just in time for my appointment .
no call .
meaning i was lied to the day before .
and again , no call .
painful .
but i wo n't be going back .
no big deal .
sadly the glasses have never fit quite right .
they fit nothing like the sample pair they have there .
the customer service for adjustments is terrible .
it more often than not i just give up and leave rather than wait .
needed help and no one could give me a straight answer .
paradise valley wet seal , i will definitely not be returning .
instead of looking like a sticks up their butt .
i could not stop laughing .
they would not tell me how much the battery cost .
Positive
i 'd give a negative star if i could !
i waited the _num_ minutes and came back and picked up my watch .
i did n't get home before the band fell apart .
lucky the watch was n't damaged by the band coming apart .
i return once again and ask for my money back .
he gives me my money .
horrible customer service .
then told me - with an attitude - they could n't honor my quote .
most pathetic management team i 've ever seen .
if you want peace of mind , never ever rent apartments in this community .
the management at this complex is horrific .
worst management ever .
the units are not upgraded at all either .
at one point , we had a roach problem .
we also had a problem one night with our front door .
this obnoxious guy downstairs was just a pain in the ass !
the only thing i never had an issue with was parking .
_num_ .
i was not even told that this even existed .
_num_ .
_num_ .
in _num_ months , no one ever came !
_num_ .
so , my original claim on this issue is still valid .
not here !
they just see dollar signs ... .
first off apartment did not look as the model that was shown to us .
they kept forgetting to come back like they said they were .
maybe hoping i did n't find out .
the only good thing about this apartment is the location .
terrible experience and terrible pedicures .
wish we had n't .
i always get gel polish on my toes because it lasts longer .
- should have been our first clue .
but did n't feel good about it .
i will not be returning .
worst $ _num_ ever spent .
terrible customer service .
employee nick looks at me .
says nothing .
i wait for him to say thank you .
not happening , he never says another word .
do n't buy here !
never again will i use this store .
i just got frustrated and left the store .
i bought my laptop there in december , after an update it stopped working .
horrible customer service .
besides this they were very condescending .
incompetent or just horrible geek squad service !
i will never buy firm thus store again .
i went to find help , but there was very little to be found .
oh well , i guess this is one reason best buy is in trouble .
i 'm taking my $ $ $ elsewhere .
she said it would take _num_ days to be removed .
long after _num_ days has passed , i continue to receive emails .
i contacted customer service again and gave them the dates .
the customer service is horrible !
they had no patience and just wanted to end the call asap .
i was wrong and it totally wasted my time .
you 're better off ordering online than having any interaction with this store .
they 'll take your money but do n't try to get customer service !
ca n't get a hold of anyone on help with a $ _num_ tv !
on hold over _num_ minutes before i hung up in frustration !
and they wonder why their stores keep closing !
needless to say i will not return to this location .
if i could give less than a one star rating i would .
after _num_ years in retail management , this was unacceptable .
i refuse to give this place any of my business .
best buy does not follow their own website 's stated price matching policies .
this location in particular is bad .
worst customer service experience i 've ever had !
apparently , they have changed that and it is now $ _num_ .
there was no `` customer service '' at all .
frankly it was just confusing to me .
i just want the old outback steak thank you .
out of my face please i am trying to eat here .
overall i have to say this was a disappointing experience .
outback is not cheap by any means .
there are plenty of other better places to go for steak .
the food is below par .
i asked for the best steak available and it was horrible .
there are too many other local places that are better .
_num_ stars , more for the food than the service .
i sat for _num_ minutes before ordering my drink .
most corporate restaurants give servers _num_ seconds to get a drink order .
our waiter smelled horrible !
im not a big fan of the steaks from here .
we werent very hungry and i was craving the mac and cheese .
after we got our food our waiter never checked on us .
he walked by a dozen times but no refills and no more bread .
this is why i try to stay away from chain restaurants .
not such a great idea , as it turns out .
)
i will stick to dinner at outback , from now on .
probably bay shrimp .
he tried the scampi , buffalo and fried .
the service is super slow !
when the entree 's arrived my guest 's side item was missing .
we ordered our entrees ( crab stuffed tilapia ) when we received the appetizer .
i 'm sorry we wo n't be coming back here .
very bad experience .
my steak was like rubber .
unfortunately that does not make for terrible food .
are you kidding me ?
this was terrible .
i sent it back and they took it off my bill .
first time i have tried going to outback for lunch .
we both ordered hamburgers with no mustard .
so she went back and got another bun .
this was high priced cafeteria food .
we where very disappointed and wo n't be back .
just served sirloin surf and turf when we ordered filet .
do n't waste your time with outback , go straight to longhorn .
was not to happy with the food .
the bun was dry and the hamburger patty was ok .
service a little slow .
this is the second time in an issue with outback this year .
the first one was terrible .
i forgot all about the bad .
one of the worst experiences i have had in a long time .
i eat out a bunch i consider myself a foodie .
should have known better than to have throw back steak .
crab cakes reminded me of potato pancakes .
i told the waitress , and she said she would let someone know .
there will not be a next visit .
outback is perhaps not as good as it used to be .
the sandwich was a huge disappointment .
outback for lunch is for people who despise taste and customer service .
how is coconut shrimp not a safe bet ?
everyone looked sad and disappointed .
always good food , but was very annoyed last time i went in .
i sat at the bar area and my service was not as usual .
very frustrating !
i has to find her just so i could go back to work .
Neutral
gave one star because i ca n't give negative stars .
i walked in this morning .
there are _num_ employees standing at the counter .
neither looks up to even say hello to me .
so lame .
also , how hard is it to have my order ready on time ?
i 'm here every day monday through friday .
dropping fedex packages off for my company .
the amount of time you have to wait to check packages in is unbelievable .
there are _num_ idiots that work there .
awful .
everything is way too salty and overpriced .
the service is the only reason it 's getting _num_ stars .
the bar was pretty empty , even though monday night football was on .
overall a very disappointing experience .
i wish i would have read the recent reviews before eating here .
their version is very pink and greasy as well .
only positive is the beer .
waitress brought me _num_ more onion rings which were the highlight of the meal .
ate my burger drank my blue moon @ $ _num_ for _num_ oz .
the bill came to $ _num_ and i left a $ _num_ .
sorely disappointed with this chain that lost its way .
in and out would have been a better choice .
no , we just stopped serving breakfast .
the only vegetarian lunch item is the cold veggie sandwich .
i made that mistake last thanksgiving !
i ordered a pumpkin pie and an apple cranberry pie .
then disaster struck .
a whole layer of chocolate under the apple and cranberry .
i could n't believe it and i was so embarrassed .
it tasted horrible .
the pumpkin pie was crappy too !
a couple weeks went by , received nothing so i emailed my address again .
it shows me that they do not care about their customers !
it 's too bad the food is pretty good because the service is horrible .
stop for breakfast this morning the portions were good the quality was not there .
the girl was not focus on customer service .
they fail today in both areas .
unhappy customer here !
for a tea party for my husband 's niece .
not helpful since the party was that day .
these were more like big flat muffin tops .
big fat cranberry muffin tops .
stop by this am for coffee and sandwich .
after it cost $ _num_ for sandwich which is high .
service could of been better and prices lower .
we ended up leaving because the service was incredibly slow .
disappointed after reading pretty decent reviews on this place .
the guy that helped me was not friendly at all .
we got a club and a southwest chicken sandwich .
not worth $ _num_ .
i was excited to try this place , but definitely wo n't be back .
i kinda just brushed it off and let it go .
i ordered the tuna sandwich , sat down , and waited for my food .
it took about _num_ minutes for our food to come out .
the three slices of cheese that we got were good .
why is it so difficult to get a good sandwich in phoenix ?
sadly , they do n't seem to care either .
they will never have what you want so why waste your time going here .
they always run out of main ingredients .
we could n't wait to go back .
not super busy when we got there .
we walked out .
i had even purchased a bread bowl on the side to help .
food is great , but customer service is horrible .
customer service could be so much better .
have never had an appt that i did not wait for over an hour .
they have wasted my time for the last time .
the staff is rude and inattentive .
just make sure you do n't pay full price .
i realized maybe not all of this is needed .
i could have wasted thousands of dollars !
a nightmare experience .
, and all the extra food was gone .
none of the toys had been taken out of the bag either .
she must have freaked out for the whole _num_ weeks .
but that was not the worst of the horror .
how confused is my sick kitty now ?
dr. wood saw him and seemed to clear things up .
i am upset because in november something was happening and it was not addressed .
just only that no one cared .
i did not know that cancer could make a pet very hungry .
but really , i do n't think the soda should be an additional cost .
she left and _num_ minutes later no one came !
terrible offering and service .
was shocked to see the grumpy , rude cashier was also the manager .
sorry i spent any money there .
my boyfriend and i both had terrible experiences here .
well , my butt is nearly exposed on one of the dresses .
( not exaggerating ) .
and the other - is terrible ... .
after i was insulted , i took my clothes and left .
i do n't mind waiting as long as i 'm given an accurate estimate .
last week i decided to give them a second try and replaced my order .
the sign was all wrong .
i do n't have any more time to waste on this company .
terrible service .
girl behind the counter has no personality at all .
_num_ weeks it 's been and still nothing from them .
_num_ star service my butt !
i literally saw _num_ people come in and just stand in the lobby .
no greeting from the owner ... nothing !
will never come back or recommend .
the service you get is not the one you really needed .
do n't go , waste of money !
i wish i could give no stars .
i arrived and gave the manager shane my keys .
i brought my toyota here last week to have the rear brakes fixed .
the car is now less functional than when i brought it in .
such a scam and a huge waste of time .
avoid like the plague !
i went to midas on bell rd .
however , i feel like this place deserves one .
the most disorganized clinic i 've been too .
you get called up by a number not even bother saying your name .
not good .
when i saw the doctor again he looked completely clueless .
basically just read off the computer things i already knew .
this place is horrible !
just gave to say i will never be back here again .
waited an hour and still did n't see the dr. really bad management .
this place does n't even deserve a start .
i do n't recommend this place at all they are horrible .
even with an appointment i have waited about _num_ hours to be seen .
this place is not professional at all .
i set up an appointment , showed up on time but was turned away .
she barely even knew how to type .
after the successful surgery , this clinic called me with referral info .
are you kidding me ?
worst place to receive medical care .
unprofessional individuals that lack of knowledge .
avoid this place like your told to avoid carbs , sugar and sodium .
arrived _num_ minutes early .
_num_ hours spent waiting and still have n't been called .
i did not visit this location .
a star is not even necessary .
i talked to three different agents and they all said the same thing .
they keep telling me that i 'm the only one with this problem .
they make you wait for hours too .
guess it can be good and bad at the same time .
it is a complete joke and you will never speak to a person .
ca n't ever seem to get a cut here .
have had the worse experience ever with this store !
i repeat do n't buy from them !
they tried to fix it three times only making it worse !
but okay let 's get what we pay for and wait _num_ more weeks .
this place is a nightmare and a joke .
_num_ rings later and it has yet to be on my finger .
horrible horrible experience from customer service to quality .
are you kidding me ?
there is only one positive to this situation and her name is wendy !
it 's unfortunate she has to work for this store because she deserves better !
and the manager chris is a major dick head fyi .
the lady i spoke with was ignorant and extremely disrespectful .
they are overpriced and lack basic customer service skills .
they did not tell me this when i called .
this store is dishonest .
wondering if the two pair deal is too good to be true ?
two people were working and there was only one other customer in the store .
most of the frames look alike with very little variety .
what the crap ?
the security guard was highly disrespectful .
i would rather wait longer than deal with that so early in the morning .
what a terrible experience .
the first time i went they were closed ( different hours ) .
i sent over the info on each job and asked for prices from them .
i could n't believe it .
i would not recommend abc glass to anyone after this experience .
weird ... just weird .
but our server seemed more interested in us getting leaving .
sorry ihop you 've disappointed me one too many times .
ordered here today , big mistake but wo n't happen again !
no apology , no nothing !
they clearly are n't concerned with customer service whatsoever given their reviews everywhere online .
stood at the front waiting to be seated for over _num_ minutes .
then left me standing there .
avoid it at all costs .
i do n't know why i bothered to come here .
bad choice !
very dissatisfied and shame on me for coming here !
rude customer service !
we did n't have enough silver wear .
bad experience !
nick , you need to have a more friendly tone .
this guy only had a couple tables , terrible service wo n't be back .
at _num_ months pregnant , i could n't wait any longer ... .
i wish i did not have to even leave one star !
do not waste your time or money !
poor service .
unclean bathrooms , slow service .
i would n't recommend coming to this location .
only gave _num_ star because _num_ was n't an option .
no silverware for anything ordered coffee .
then _num_ min after we ordered we still did not have food .
dirty gross bathroom .
all _num_ other people in my party had their food.
great not even halfway through with the cold food .
and she brings us _num_ receipt instead of _num_ like we asked .
was insulting .
this location is horrible .
so now lots of pain and dr appointments for this .
way to waste a bunch of money .
glad caffeine only hurts me and does n't kill me .
this is the worst ihop location i have ever been to .
servers ca n't communicate with each other .
worst ihop ever !
i get really grossed out by dirty dishes on the tables all around me .
i do n't even want to know what the restrooms look like !
i wo n't return to this location again !
very rude manager .
lame .
gross .
but hands down the worst customer service i have ever received !
loved this place up until now .
too much people .
is business really that bad guys ?
this location is old and tired .
it took him at least _num_ minutes to do one cart .
the lady working the self check out was just as rude .
did n't greet or say goodbye .
we had to change rooms on the first night .
the second room was so dusty .
i had a miserable night .
i do n't have this problem under typical conditions .
before i forget to mention , one of the sofa chairs upholstery was torn .
lol i guess the wifi is for their staff .
does n't honor requested rooms .
nice views but do not be fooled .
this happened _num_ out of the three nights i stayed there .
* fan in bathroom did not work .
no one did -- no follow up and no improvement .
customer service is nonexistent .
no assistance with luggage at all .
they were sitting in plain sight behind the counter .
whoever is managing the training needs to be replaced .
wo n't be coming back .
very basic hotel priced too high for what it is .
worse kfc ever !
service is horrible .
this is the absolute worst kfc i 've ever been to .
i have to pay additional _num_ cents to use my card .
last time we ate there er all got sick .
we got bad stomach pain .
i think half their food is rotten .
bad place .
`` ok , we 'll substitute corn . ''
can i substitute `` original recipe ? ''
turned around and walked away .
out of original recipe ?
geez ... get organized .
this kfc never fails to disappoint .
the chicken was n't bad either .
but this location is horrific !
the service here is terrible .
not once has any of the staff apologized for the inconvenience .
been there , done that - no one answered the phone when i called .
ugh .
terrible service !
the wait is endless and my order is never correct .
this is n't the first time !
terrible service !
when there is only two other customers there ... really ?
worst customer service ever .
i wo n't be returning to this location ever again .
just a rude attitude for no reason .
stopped for breakfast burrito and a cup of coffee .
never knew food could taste so bad along with the coffee .
threw it in the trash and went elsewhere .
worst place i 've ever stopped for breakfast in my life .
i was in there tuesday august _num_ around noon .
the guy working was not helpful and rude .
now i remember why i stopped coming here .
it takes forever to get your food .
the food came out after a long wait .
i took one bite and that one was bland .
i would n't mind if the food was worth it .
average tasting food items as the day is long .
pet owners beware .
check other reviews here ( david w. below ) that match our experience .
this was the worst veterinary experience we 've ever had .
i got what i paid for , but it was n't worth the hassle .
my god !
fire and gas stations do n't mix !
and `` no thank you '' is n't good enough .
go to danny 's , they understand that no means no .
car wash poor .
lazy employees .
when spoke with manager he stood behind his lazy employees .
_num_ star is being generous .
i immediately threw away wash card i had signed up for .
wow what a sloppy car wash .
the ultimate honestly is n't worth the $ _num_ .
i will not be back to this place .
not worth the price .
horrible cleaning job !
now , their car wash prices are a lot higher for lousy cleaning .
the employees are incredibly pushy to upsell you on a simple car wash .
i wish i had not given them a second chance .
no , i do not want you to rotate my tires .
no , i do not like green eggs and ham .
save your self the hassle , do n't use cobblestone .
not sure if its water spots or excessive soap not being washed off .
the car is clean but very spotty .
everytime i have to use a wet rag to wipe the spots off .
if you want to throw your money away go to this carwash .
i paid $ _num_ for ultimate plus .
when i went to pick up my car , the interior was dirty .
wow !
he was n't even there to get a car washed .
you just lost my business .
i was , and still am , very upset over this whole situation .
went today for the $ _num_ special and my car was still dirty !
other $ _num_ car washes in town do a fine job for $ _num_ !
thanks for the crappy wash guys .
_num_ .
do n't let cars sit in the sun after you wash them !
_num_ .
_num_ .
even bought the $ _num_ monthly membership .
by far the worst car wash i have ever had .
for $ _num_ you would think they would wipe down the inside a little .
horrible , horrible , horrible service .
so they said they would run it through again and vacuum the seats .
we are n't difficult and trying to get something for nothing .
they agreed to shampoo and was the car for $ _num_ .
i would n't recommend anyone take their vehicles to any of the cobblestone .
went to get a car was on july _num_ , _num_ .
i had a horrible experience here .
i got an exterior wash on my way out of town .
i was n't asking for a complete detail .
which is a complete run around .
told me they do n't put tape on cars .
the manager was not making this right .
where has customer service gone .
i will not recommend a place that does n't own their mistakes .
no integrity .
high pressure sales , more than most care washes .
unless you like high pressure sales !
i was told it would take _num_ min for my car to be detailed .
terrible service and will not return .
i spend $ _num_ a week at this place for _num_ cars .
sadly , i went back to give it another chance .
my car had not been wiped down at all when i got it back .
terrible do not pay for anything more than a regular car wash .
_num_ hours later i call them , oh it 's done now .
he said he could n't get it off .
the place is awful !
he said no if someone falls on the curb its not our fault .
no offer of towels to get the fuel off my fiance clothes .
he was too busy looking cool to care about a potential hazard !
first time here and was up sold to the ultimate car wash .
i was n't a _num_ detail job for what i paid but come on .
not some gigantic suv .
i went today to get a basic car wash .
i called and left a message with amanda to have the manager call me .
so far no call .
do n't waste your money .
terrible , i mean terrible car wash .
these complaints were basically ignored till i got frustrated and left .
car still had bugs on the front .
he insisted that they had in fact used it .
i get the monthly pass and i go multiple times per week .
a mud package ?
i really want to try this place based on all the reviews and pictures .
still not open and it 's march .
i feel more fake shopping in there , than where i usually do .
the paradise valley location has extremely disappointing service !
neither of them cared to provide any type of customer service .

i talked to a salesperson named josh .
this salesperson refused to help me .
was told to `` bring it in '' .
terrible experience !

also , i was given a prescription that was way too strong .
could n't be happier .
had a very specific conversation about how young patients can be .
they have no respect for the patient 's time .
they deserve one star !
the staff is plain rude here .
one of the ladies ca n't even say hi .
Neutral
if i could give this place a negative rating , i would .
this place does n't deserve stars .
the employees in this place ignore the customers .
kids today are not too bright .
horrible lately .
if you do n't like your job , find another one .
awful customer service and crappy ice cream .
this place is really run down .
also there was a cockroach on the counter where you get the drinks .
it really needs to be cleaned up .
terrible decision to come here tonight .
took over over _num_ minutes to get through their drive thru .
it was pathetic .
avoid at all costs .
horrible customer service too .
terrible experience , look elsewhere .
blizzard machine was broken , so i settled for a dilly bar .
very disappointing .
wish i could give it less stars !
workers were very friendly but food was absolutely terrible .
very disappointed .
this place has the worst service ever .
no greeting .
no , `` i 'll be with you in a minute . ''
they messed up _num_ drive thru orders .
unfortunate that one star is the lowest a half would be too much .
this place is terrible .
incompetent people working .
slow slow slow drive thru .
they also ran out of chocolate ice cream .
just said forget it and left .
no stars .
horrible service .
the manager took _num_ minutes to come to the window .
_num_ minutes later we were still waiting .
gross .
this place has awesome prices and tacos but the service really sucks .
the waitress passed me up _num_ times before serving me .
horrible !
we waited over _num_ mins with no service what so ever .
still no service .
we had money to spend on food and drinks , we were completely ignored .
even the door attendant could not believe that we did n't get service .
but i will not return .
i really do n't know what people see in this place .
one thing , it does have that old crusty bar feel .
actually , the sandwich i ate did n't sit very well with me either .
we went back _num_ more times and it was not good .
the chicken was pink inside , and not slightly pink .
my wife was in a panic that she 'd be sick .
i have been here _num_ different times .
each visit after the first proved to be worse than the time before .
the bartender completely ignored us for the first almost _num_ minutes we were there .
then i spent another few hours waiting for the check .
nothing special about it .
not very welcoming .
i do n't drink i am just the dedicated driver .
with out the dd 's there would n't be the drinkers .
so that 's a bad business move .
that to is a bad business move .
i was here with a party of about _num_ drinking people .
celebrating _num_ birthday 's and they came from all over the valley .
none are to pleased and now are leaving .
i do n't drink i am just the dedicated driver .

that to is a bad business move .
i was here with a party of about _num_ drinking people .
celebrating _num_ birthday 's and they came from all over the valley .
none are to pleased and now are leaving .
i 've never witnessed anything so unprofessional in my life .
i was really upset and , even more so , embarrassed .
since mercedes stopped working here , the service has gone down hill .
we miss mercedes and wish she was back .
i 'd give it a half star ... if i could ...
change of ownership brought this formerly _num_ star dive bar to negative rating .
they recently changed ownership and have gone downhill in a burning pile of stench .
the only redeeming thing about this place are the friday night trivia hosts .
i hope she goes away soon , i 'm sure that would help .
went here for my _num_ birthday to sing karaoke .
went through the rotation like _num_ times and never called us .
ruined our night .
seemed like the guy was n't excited about what we wanted to sing .
just looking for karaoke bars for tonight and saw this place .
still not over it apparently .
i went with a big group last night and was incredibly disappointed .
the waitress was unfriendly and kept blowing us off .
it was such a shame .
yet due to their employees poor attitudes , other stores will get my business .
wow , wrong .
their jeweler would n't be back until the end of february .
um , really ?
it was supposed to only take a few days .
ours however is nowhere to be found .
i may change my review depending on what happens .
my first impression was that it looked a little rundown and not too clean .
i was immediately led to a massage chair which looked worn .
there was one other customer getting a pedicure when i arrived .
she rushed through my pedicure and was looking away most of the time .
after several awkward minutes i started to get up from the chair .
i handed him the coupon and money .
no one looked at me or said thanks for coming .
let 's just say i was there for more than _num_ hours .
this was the most painful experience i 've ever had at a nail salon .
my toes looked the same as if i did them myself .
the last time i did this was years ago .
this place was horrible !
on a busy sunday there is no place to wait in comfort .
the ac sucks & they do n't accommodate seating for large families .
sad thing is none of us are over weight .
they could not accommodate a seating for the baby in a high chair .
only a ten minute wait was indicated , so we decided to stay .
eventually , beverage orders were taken .
uninspired .
not all of their air conditioning .
not even close .
only _num_ tables in the whole restaurant !
tonight was that night .
i got there and _num_ minutes later still had no food in my hand .
she never apologized nor offered to make it right in any way .
she totally failed to fix the situation .
the service is not what it used to be two years ago .
beware the wait time if you dare to eat here !
nothing special .
the waitress service is very poor .
the service is lousy .
after that he was really slow with the food and never came with refills .
unless you want to waste time do n't go to this dennys .
terrible service but edible food .
worse dennys experience ever .
but will not go back .
yes , she gave me another to go at no charge for either .
then he asked for my visa but the guy never ran it .
service is terrible at this location .
wo n't come back to this location .
had a horrid odor and i just walked out .
take out is a hit or miss most times .
expect to wait _num_ mins to sit if you have more than _num_ people .
disgusting '' .
the server was clearly not there ( in other words out to lunch ) .
just checking if you want me to come back . ''
veggie omelet was burnt and disgusting and we were served the wrong drinks .
then we waited another _num_ minutes after we were done waiting on our bill .
worst place ever !
lack of service .
lack of respect .
utterly disgusting .
tables were dirty as fuck .
the people did n't look clean .
took _num_ minutes to be acknowledged that we were even there at all .
why the hell is this even still in business ?
no wonder it was _num_ stars !
horrible customer service !
i waited almost _num_ minutes for an omelette !
the omelette also was not cooked right .
they were busy and did n't have enough staff .
big mistake !
no greeting given by the older man at the front .
anyway , i ordered a `` light and fluffy '' smoothie .
it was average at best .
over $ _num_ for a small .
sorry for the long review but this place deserves only one star .
not so healthy if you ask me .
this made me dread coming into smoothie king .
i wo n't be back .
there was a line of _num_ people waiting in line .
false hours .
also , when they were open , guy working was kind of rude .
did not even say hi or welcome .
nasty !
i thought to myself never again will i come back here .
poor customer service .
horrible customer service .
waited _num_ minutes to get my eyebrows done as a walk-in .
if i could post no stars , i would .
make an appointment , do n't waste your time , it wo n't matter .
so slow ... we waited an hour and a half .
the staff were lovely , there just were n't enough of them .
no call .
i waited _num_ hours and _num_ minutes to get a blood draw today .
it is just too understaffed .
no bueno autozone ... .
the new management however left me no choice but to shop somewhere else .
at this point i am mad and it takes alot to make me mad .
i think they charge too much for powder acrylics .
well it 's still coming up and feels like it 'll pop off
very impersonal .
not so much as a goodbye or thank you .
rude .
$ _num_ for a lack luster service with mediocre quality work .
i 'm tired of being treated like a dollar sign ... never going back .
just that it was going to be an hour wait and to sit down .
however when i went to get a fill my nails looked horrible .
the customer service was awful .
this experience was embarrassing and made me feel uncomfortable being in their business .
the building is very run down and not taken care of .
even the caesar salad was disappointing .
i will not be back for a third rip off .
my only issue with it was i considered to be a rather pricy restaurant .
the last two times we have been there have been rather disappointing .
the meal went downhill after that .
although the food was great , the service was seriously lacking .
we asked to sit at the many empty tables for four .
were told no as they all had reservations .
nasty nasty nasty - especially to a blind person .
i would n't put anything in my mouth made in that hostile place .
this place was very disappointing .
service took forever 10+ min for drinks 30+ min for food .
very limited menu and food was ok.
small sad portions for the price .
felt a bit ripped off .
the cuisine is just pretty bad .
i wish these people well here but we wo n't be back .
he was not pleased .
it also came with the unappealing rigatoni and frozen veggies .
dh ate about three bites of his chicken parm .
i finished the veal and what sauce i could scoop up .
but mediocre food and service takes it off our list for a return visit .
too bad .
both were lame and were returned .
mediocre dish with mediocre taste .
even for watered down italian style food , i was disappointed .
serious diners , skip this place .
walked in and waited a couple mins .
she gave me a bad look and had a bad attitude .
we did n't eat here and will never be back .
service was slow , very slow .
it was a lazy sunday and place was not even half full .
i do n't even remember what we got it was so forgettable .
just blah , it provided some calories and nothing more .
everything was just bland an so-so .
the beans are bland and the rice is salty .
the salsa is n't right , either .
the service is sub-par .
i 'm not going back .
it was a pricey lunch with tip i spent $ _num_ .
how bad can you mess up mexican food ?
pink neon reminds me of some _num_ 's diner .
also on this must recent visit i had really poor service .
nothing on the menu was less then $ _num_ for a combo dish .
man , $ _num_ bucks for some marginal mexican food ?
as others have pointed out , the salsa is terrible .
despite my trying to `` improve '' the salsa , i failed .
the lighting was tres obnoxious .
they closed the location on indian school years ago , for the same reasons .
i stopped back in after being away from julio g 's take out .
had _num_ beef tacos and rice ... .
they have forgotten to do this .
bad attitude and average food , skip it .
too many nice business owners to give hard earned money .
i will not be returning their and they lost a customer for life .
the fried touch made it not quite crispy , just a little greasy .
i was overwhelmed and ate less than half the entree .
nothing worth taking with me , either .
i came here last night with two others .
our server was friendly , but not personable .
some people just are n't , and that 's ok .
i wish their spicy salsa was spicier though .
but there was no , or at least very little , salt and pepper .
understaffed is never a good thing for a restaurant .
empty dirty tables and a _num_ minute wait .
no service .
no bartender to even get a beer while u wait !
bland flavors and no salsas on the salsa bar .
wo n't come here again for food .
there are better mexican places .
chips were pretty good ... salsa horrible .
the worst mexican ever felt the quality was better at taco bell .
this is not mexican .
my food was cold and bad tasting .
did not sit well in my stomach .
overhead the manager drop the f bomb a few times !
the food has no flavor , place is exceptionally loud and rundown .
no flavor and no one uses cheap flavorless round steak for fajitas .
greasy , tasteless food .
too expensive for the quality .
this used to be a favorite of mine but now ?
greasy food , aweful guacamole .
so rude .
the lady there was very curt and obnoxious .
i would not recommend them at all .
stay far away from this moving company .
the woman who answers the phone is rude .
big mistake !
the men that were sent out were rude as well .
they were slow , took several breaks , answered phone calls , ect .
i really hate to do this , but i have to .
service was slower than slow .
my bagel + cream cheese was super skimpy on the cream cheese .
turkey chili was lukewarm and not as good as it should have been .
it just was n't a good experience .
the place feels cramped and dirty .
after asking if there were any others , i was told , `` nope .
so i left it and walked out .
i would n't even call what they serve bagels .
disgusting .
taste like nasty rye bread bagels .
go to dunkin donuts they 're better for a chain that makes bagels .
this is the worst customer service i have ever had to deal with .
it just seems to have gotten sloppy and disappointing .
staff ( besides assistant manager ) is completely incompetent .
never even came back to the register or apologized for the wait .
i could 've ran out with my bagel without paying !
this place has really gone down .
just nasty !
all the while , the `` manager '' is standing around talking .
big mistake !
customer service was non existent .
in fact , we barely even tasted cream cheese at all .
i wo n't be back .
who ever is ordering supplies , is not doing a good job .
worst place i have been too .
they get our order wrong every single time we go there .
i have complained to the management thru phone , and email with no response .
absolutely horrible customer service .
usually , all i get is a bagel or two and i am out .
this place is horrible !
it 's a one star rating by default , deserving of no stars .
off the bat , this was not a task she could handle .
she pulled out the smoothie mix and then she glazed over .
back at the cash register , the mug rings up $ _num_ .
she tells me that this is all she can take off .
the last straw that will forever make me avoid this franchise .
we were the only customers in at the time of ordering !
today , with only _num_ people ahead of me , it took _num_ minutes .
another time there were hardly any bagels on a friday morning .
i assumed that my eyes just needed time to adjust to long term wear .
so what exactly is too close ?
lowest of the low .
this place sucks .
horrible customer service .
i think i 'm done giving them a chance and my money .
horrible service .
they do n't do a good job cleaning .
do n't bother going there .
Neutral
can i give a negative _num_ ?
it 's been over a week and they still have not found my comforter .
i am disabled and spend most of my time in bed .
which in my opinion , should n't be an issue for a professional cleaners .
they ruined one of my favorite dresses .
- had to have a few items redone because stains were not removed .
most dry cleaners search for stains .
skip this place and go somewhere with better service !
not so with new owner .
even wrote the owner a letter which was never acknowledged .
they lost me as a customer plus my daughter and granddaughter .
too many other great places who want me to keep coming back .
wo n't go back .
horrible customer service .
rude .
just got a pink and white back fill , they look terrible .
the only good news is that the prices are cheap .
the breakfast is especially good with the chicken fried steak being my personal favorite .
my only reason for not giving it another star would be the decor .
i could have handled the average food if the service was n't so lackluster .
go for the golf , do n't stay for the food .
overall this was a poor experience .
very disappointing .
buffet was crap and the biggest rip off ever !
service was horrible .
could n't get water , silverware or extra napkins .
this buffet should have cost $ _num_ per person , not $ _num_ .
i should have went to the big irish bar instead .
i do n't let trash build up .
the managers response was why did n't i tell them earlier !
i asked why did n't you or your people notice it ?
it 's not just that , the whole complex looks bad .
while polite people , i must say that it is a complete half job .
groupon buyers beware .
not only that , but the floors were n't even clean .
needless to say , that wo n't be happening .
what a house should look like after _num_ people cleaned for an entire hour .
or that the hose was bad ?
they just do n't make men like they used too !
these guys are low down little boys !
however , this one disappointed .
the food came out in a short time .
very disappointing .
never eat here .
the chicken was flavorful but the salsa were definitely lacking .
the staff is n't very pleasant or efficient at all .
dining in is a mistake because that place is not clean .
i wish management would notice the issues and make the necessary changes .
_num_ minutes to make _num_ fish tacos and they screwed up the order .
however , tonight i decided to try their new california bowl .
the concept was , but in reality it was not even close .
i assume it is called the california bowl because of the guacamole .
however , the amount of guacamole was highly disappointing .
i added chicken and again highly disappointed with how much chicken they added .
i could barely taste that there was even chicken .
overall , the new addition to the menu was a huge disappointment .
horrible service .
i was told the order would take _num_ minutes to be set up ... .
there were no other customers in the restaurant .
i could not believe the lack of professionalism by a manager .
the food was fine , but the staff was so unprofessional it was shocking .
are you kidding me ?
later i found out that this employee was a manager named daniel .
consistency of food is why i am giving this a _num_ star .
last three times i have been there it has been this way .
not appealing .
i am rating this one because i can not leave feedback with zero stars .
the filing was getting old and i had it redone .
i stayed with her bc i had a routine cleaning coming up .
i really wanted to like this place ... but i left unimpressed .
$ _num_ for a shellac manicure .
it just seems that their techs need more training .
there was something wrong with either their application method or the gel polish itself .
nope , it 's no longer my favorite nail salon .
what a disappointing experience !
do n't waste your money here !
i would give them zero stars if possible .
such a terrible experience here !
the person who did my gel did a horrible job .
and now my nails are very damaged and thin and keep breaking .
needless to say , i went to another nail salon to get them fixed .
just $ _num_ down the drain .
will not be coming back here ever .
they should make him go out back behind the building .
you ca n't go back bob .
very very disappointed with this salon .
would not recommend .
$ _num_ plus tip down the drain .
what a disappointment .
the flavors were bland .
the presentation was awful .
_num_ margaritas just is n't up to par .
gross !
how bad was it ?
!
do not waste your dining dollars here .
Neutral
i wish they could give negative stars .
i have never , ever , ever walked out without finishing my food .
i also know when to spot a crappy one .
it was awful .
no apology , no nothing ?
staff was rude .
it 's bad enough having it done once - but twice !
i 'm just not a fan of having anyone in my business .
it was really gross .
do n't bother asking for help .
so the doctor was nice enough ... no complaints on that front .
however , i was appalled at the process .
ca n't you look me up ?
it was n't as bad , but certainly substandard .
it 's not comfortable or enjoyable .
i was willing to wait , no problem , and did so happily .
i waited _num_ weeks for my appointment because of the paperwork for first appointment .
if you call here , be prepared for major attitude .
be prepared to wait for a week or more .
poor excuses given every single time .
i will not miss your attitude or your lack of common sense .
it is ridiculous .
i could say lot more , but you get the point .
horrible .
unfortunately this is n't a happy review like the others i write .
this place is lacking , i will not be going back .
this year , it 's been nothing but a disorganized mess .
she said `` no we do n't do that .
i got this scheduled , they called _num_ days prior to confirm .
they wasted my time .
that 's absurd .
the day i go in , they do n't have my current info .
could n't even get past the extremely rude scheduling lady .
good thing i 'm , not dying . ''
i started to call back and i asked myself `` why '' ?
the doctor might be great if you could get past the rude staff .
boy was i wrong .
unacceptable , arrogant and they no longer have our business .
now the second one was also not done properly .
so not only is it bad service but bad work as well .
drinks are cheap and the bartenders are young & attractive .
dirty , gross , not fun at all .
gross !
)
that is n't the case here .
unfortunately , this holds especially true for his wife .
unfortunately , i am never able to talk to him .
sad , i wo n't go back .
got a gyro here .
i guess this place would be okay if they know you .
if you 're not in their computer , forget about buying shoes here .
or , did you just not want to sell to me ?
?
useless bullshit .
do not go here .
horrible costumer service .
horrible customer service from , i believe the store manager .
so this starts a car fight of how this can possibly be so ?
so , when we get the window , it 's actually _num_ .
crap , if only we 'd had a napkin !
for what you pay this meal is definitely not worth it .
the food is terrible .
the gravy has been changed and is terrible .
i could n't each much of any of this .
they have changed owners and we do not go there .
they do not go out of their way to help you in a crunch .
terrible customer service , terrible prices .
as a result i will never step foot in that shop again .
so disappointed and completely embarrassed by what arrived .
when we finally got a permanent teacher , the damage was done .
man , i hated this school .
$ _num_ for _num_ shirts and a suit !
rip off alert !
never , ever go there .
complete lies .
they said it was , that everything would be ready today after 5pm .
this meant that are items would not be ready until tuesday after 9am .
they had everything but it would n't be ready until after 3pm on wednesday .
do not trust this store .
how on gods green earth does this place have _num_ stars ?
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
she was young , and clearly lacked experience in customer service .
horrible !
if i could give them _num_ stars i would 've .
do n't waste your time or money .
i have gone to urgent care , got on antibiotics and nothing is working .
the worst place i have ever gone .
starting right off they were rude talking about us while doing our pedicures .
i went with my friend here to get a basic pedicure and gel manicure .
she has a terrible attitude and does n't even do a decent job .
she did n't even bother to say anything to me at the end .
ridiculous .
matthew was no where in site !
ugh finally said screw everyone and ill just tow my car home .
i will not return to this location .
one word slow appointments are worthless .
you arrive _num_ minutes early and get in _num_ minutes late .
they say _num_ minutes to an hour it takes _num_ hours .
they said they would give me a premium tire .
walked out and never went back .
terrible service experience !
very unprofessional , i will not go here again .
this place is hit or miss .
an hour and a half goes by and no call .
but next day oil light comes on and the fluids are n't filled .
what a joke pep boys .
very bad and greedy people !
i went back with aaa and they towed the car back to my house .
they put it back together and had my car towed back home .
moving down the road to a new home for car repair .
as of this posting it 's been over _num_ hours and no call .
no apology , no can i get you bottle of water , no nothing .
i leave the lounge area and stand by the checkout area .
no paperwork .
i check out this story online and find it actually happens .
no acknowledgement of my wasted time and gas .
no offer of a `` next oil change is on us '' coupon .
no nothing .
pathetic !
horrible customer service .
my car is not worth that price .
i just kept quiet looked at what they said needed repairs for my car .
i know my car , and i know what repairs where needed .
bought _num_ tires , installation , and warranty here about _num_ years ago .
this was not covered even with their useless extra tire protection we paid for .
then tell me i need to pay for another mount and balance as well .
this is a horrible place to buy tires .
she says hi .
cool , no biggie , but no points for hospitality there .
so , we play some shuffle board .
the menus said that thursday was indian fry bread day .
i thought it was gon na be an irish place , not even close .
i loved coming here on saturdays for sex trivia .
since the last encounter with him , we have n't been back .
it 's a real shame because i really enjoyed hanging out there .
horrible horrible service .
all tables around us were just as unsatisfied .
just went there tonight for the _num_ cent wings on monday night .
waited _num_ minutes before the lazy waitress decided to come greet me .
just got _num_ dozen wings .
not exaggerating at all .
she did n't seem to care at all i was clearly upset .
also not one time did she refill my drink ... not one time .
i find that weird .
why bother ?
my husband order ordered chicken wings he liked the sauce .
unfortunately , the customer service , myself and my group experienced was below par .
it was a very poor example of customer service .
been here three times , first time was a little slow but awesome .
decided to stop in for a beer and potatoes skins and wings .
waitress returned with two orange slices face down on a napkin !
ate the great potato skins and wings .
this was my second visit in a year .
and would n't give our cash back after she took our bill .
ordered a bloody mary with gin , he put vodka in !
_num_ people at the bar , no excuse .
ordered a burger , most disgusting thing i have ever tasted .
i feel sick to my stomach .
ok no big , deal , right ?
i 'm not even someone that gets bit by bugs normally .
it was disgusting .
i 'm so glad i did n't get married at a place like this .
also only a handful of people danced .
_num_ % of the venue is outdoors .
now for the things that stood out as bad .
worst mexican `` food '' ever .
apparently the chicken quesadilla was n't bad .
i will not be coming back here again .
he also commented on the lack of meat on a few of the tacos .
no thank you , i 'll find another locally own restaurant to support .
i wish i could reach out to the owner !
we stopped going because the quality went down .
it 's disgusting now .
food is not the best .
salsa is watered down .
they barely put any guac or sour cream on the food .
no bueno .
friday night was rough .
taco bell is almost closed , so where else to go ?
after taking one bite it all became clear .
gross .
grilled chicken or not the numbers were pretty bad .
i would assume an ordinary burger with lettuce and tomato would be better .
place was clean and they were busy .
Positive
wish i could leave negative stars !
sent _num_ pieces of art to ca , _num_ were very damaged !
when i called , said name lee , did n't even apologize .
ghetto , and rude customer service !
after they were done chit chatting she then helped me ?
also i do n't think the ac was working properly in that store .
nice guys , but totally missed the real cause of my issues .
rob and another gentleman came out and were very friendly and explained everything .
this was just a mushy soaked thing .
do n't really know how to call it .
just awful .
also , what kind of soda choices are these ?
not very clean , i would say !
i am not really sure what the hype is about .
instead , this is my typical experience .
i do n't see anyone looking at comics .
yeah i do n't know if we will get that in .
no notice .
just left a note on the door .
i ordered my usual chile relleno burrito .
here they fill the space around the chile with rice cheese and sauce .
the one surprising thing is that i did not get sick .
this place is terrible .
i could n't finish my chili relleno plate .
his chicken burrito did have a couple bones in it .
after all , it is hard to screw up an egg and potato burrito .
it seems like this food would taste much better while drunk or hungover .
i wo n't be back .
went through the drive through for lunch a few weeks back .
had been craving a carne asada burrito .
it took longer then i expected for a drive through , no big deal .
always glad to find a quick burrito place for those occasional cravings .
before i ate anything at dinner something in the belly was n't feeling right .
did n't leave for _num_ hours .
food poisoning is awful .
made us sick the past two times we went .
it is sad because they used to be better than most mexican places .
are you freakin ' kidding me ?
i would not use this company again .
but make sure you get your estimate in writing .
i was quoted a price then charged _num_ times more than quoted .
after a _num_ minute conversation , he would not come to any agreement .
this is a dishonest company .
i opened another cabinet and there was a stain inside .
i always knew this is not the best hospital .
not very alert , begging for water or ice chips .
hours in your er for nothing .
no thanks to you .
she suddenly just walked away with not a word of explanation .
next thing i knew , matthew showed up with no word of explanation .
this had to be the worse .
it really was as bad as i had heard this evening .
there was dried blood and hairs everywhere .
none of the doctors would listen to me .
it is a very very poor hospital .
it seems they just want to milk your insurance .
they do not care about you .
i had no pain , and diarrhea .
if i could give pv hospital zero stars , i would !
they are very sorry .
this hospitals er staff is completely unprofessional and inept !
about an hour goes by and nothing .
she comes in with paperwork for me to sign so that i can leave .
which i understand but i would have appreciated any update .
i am not paying a dime to pv hospital .
if i could give pv zero stars , i would .
horrible establishment poor excuse for a hospital .
terrible experience , wont even get into the details .
once that was done , i was brought for an x-ray .
i went instead to mayo clinic and so glad i did .
did i have a fever in the last _num_ hours ?
i will never ... never ... go to paradise valley hospital again .
the worst hospital on the planet !
absolutely no care at all !
shame in me for giving this dump another chance !
this place needs to be shut down asap !
if you have a say in the matter , stay away from this er !
terrible terrible terrible !
do not leave your money in any bags or cabinets they offer .
sleep with you wallet !
they came into my room when i was sleeping and stole my money .
horrible !
however his staff and getting a prescription is absolutely irritating .
_num_ % off any purchase over $ _num_ .
but they did n't honor the yelp discount .
very disappointed in the customer service i had .
will not be going back to this store .
if i do it will not be with this employee .
was n't a good experience by any means .
they are nice doctors but the wait time is horrible .
i would stay away from this office .
i took my dog in to get groomed .
that why i had to wait so long .
oh ... but im not done yet ... .
if i could give this location a zero star rating , i would .
worst experience ever !
nothing about her cut was even and she was completely shaking .
so i bought the collar and left .
so frustrating .
i 'm going to try hard and not be too brutal .
almost feels like we are talking pig latin or something .
it stinks !
i said , `` what kind of question is that ? ''
after waiting on hold for a long time , i hung up .
grooming salon has gone downhill !
i will not be going back .
and she told me they too need the same tlc .
unbelievable .
i visited _num_ of them .
i like petco , but the staff was very unfriendly at this location .
i 'll never frequent panda express again .
rude employees .
sorry ... three strikes and your out !
we ended up purchasing a new pair at sports authority instead .
today as i stood at the register waiting for someone to seat me .
another guy in the kitchen area opposite him was facing me .
this was a _num_ second dig .
i was in mesa and tried their other location a week earlier .
a week later i had to give the phoenix location another chance .
this is my only _num_ star rating since using yelp .
we waited _num_ mins to be seated that was no big deal .
waitresses avoided our table handed out checks refilled glasses to other customers .
i have never felt so disrespected .
bad service , ok food .
this place has gone downhill my friends .
i guess there was my mistake .
there were only _num_ other people in the restaurant .
i returned after two years and knew something was wrong .
the service was terrible , the food was bad and prices had gone up .
worst place for mariscos .
food was n't good at all ; extremely bland and service was terrible .
this place always looks busy and i do n't understand why .
i wish i had n't grown up .
i went to this store which made regret ever being a toys r kid .
and it did n't take me too long to come to that conclusion .
i showed him what i ordered and he went to the back .
he returned about _num_ minutes later and asked me again what i had ordered .
this time i handed him the receipt i had brought with me .
the employee did not seem to care one bit about the situation .
_num_ employees at the front register for _num_ customers .
ask another employee for help he said it 's not his area .
disappointed enough to write this review in the parking lot .
went down , spent my $ , and no figure because i priced match .
the supervisor came up , said thats the way it is .
they also do not pay their vendors .
i would not recommend buying or selling anything to them .
the cashiers are rather rude .
overpriced products that make me think they just do n't price shop their competition .
they have that going for them so i give them _num_ stars .
awful customer service from everybody there ( including the post office people ) .
very rude , inconsiderate , and unhelpful .
the prices are not good .
it is a pain to return anything here .
they have a good selection but their store is not laid out very well .
also , their customer service is hit or miss .
would not look up or acknowledge me in any way .
customer service is rude .
i 'll never go into ace hardware again .
_num_ boxes would have cost me $ _num_ for _num_ boxes .
paid $ _num_ for _num_ boxes at home depot on bell rd .
i always want to like this place but i just ca n't .
another problem is with what the store calls `` seasonal items . ''
nowhere on their receipt does it say that .
next , the cashier tells me the lights need to be in the box .
but wait she says the lights must be tested .
needless to say at this point i am extremely frustrated and getting mad .
he refuses and asks for my name .
i ask again for his name and refuses again .
i leave with the lights and will never shop here again .
horrible customer service !
disappointed .
very poor and non friendly service prices are outrageous .
but , i guess there is a store for everyone .
i hate going into this store .
they seem to be trying to sell everything but hardware ( ie .
worst service i 've ever had .
i go to ace in tempe all the time and am always treated professionally .
this is definitely the worst ace hardware i have ever been in .
not the home of the helpful hardware man .
called about _num_ minutes before they closed for a stock check .
this ace 's customer service has gotten really bad .
very disappointed !
the worst costumer service i have experienced with ace .
ugh .
the service is slow and they are always understaffed .
nobody could help me this morning and i was looking for assistance .
so i leave my stuff and say i ca n't wait any longer .
absurd !
will not be back .
the employees i dealt with today were rude .
ended up with cosmetic damage on the exterior of the frames .
repair tech offered $ _num_ off , but frames are still damaged .
will not repeat business here .
the worst part , though , was the service .
yikes -- wo n't be back .
ok , simple mistake , i thought .
i walked and will never return .
do n't know why this place is rated so high .
bartender not too friendly and it 's a dump !
the bartender was nice enough but only _num_ stars for a waste of time .
it was really busy on a sunday .
pedicure was $ _num_ ( _num_ for anything fancy like french tips ) .
so it lost a cleanliness point for me .
i arrived _num_ min early was greeted and seated on time .
i assume she washed with water and soap if we 're lucky !
forget the coupon , i 'll go elsewhere next time .
i had a horrible experience this last time and will never go back .
kind of too late to tell me to wait in my opinion .
i totally understand that mistakes happen .
i could have ran some errands and come back later , no problem .
there are too many other nail salons around to put up with this treatment .
i will never go back ( nor will my friends or family ) .
felt rushed in and out .
went with _num_ friends and no one was very satisfied .
will not be going back .
this place is not very clean at all .
just a bad feel all together .
they do n't accept tips in debit or credit card form which is weird .
my _num_ daughters and i will not return to queens nails .
they have lost our business .
very poor business !
the worst customer service that i have ever had in my life .
i am not a fan in ulta in general , but especially this location .
specials are misleading ( e.g .
the sales staff are incredibly rude .
sephora , why do you have to be over _num_ miles from my home ?
this ulta is awful !
it 's hard to find anything and some of the staff are very rude .
anyways , i do n't see how she still works there .
worst service ever .
walked in and the woman rolled her eyes at me .
lol i 'm not sure what i did .
it was pretty empty and very clean .
walked around looking for a item for a good _num_ min and no help .
the salons looked clean there was no staff for walk ins .
i was treated very poorly at this location .
i left crying i was so upset and disappointed with my hair .
thank god they have a return policy .
they never have my make up in stock .
i always have to drive to a location farther away to get it .
note she did not tell me about the price increase before the session .
i paid the $ _num_ , but she certainly got no tip !
she wo n't get a third chance !
she then immediately walked away .
i am writing this review to address my recent visit to your pv store .
once arriving at the said location i was greeted promptly .
and i began my trek through your , seemingly endless , store .
no man carries an ulta card .
really rude staff .
honestly , it was pretty rude .
i wait around and she does n't come back and completely blows me off .
i searched for an associate to help but no one was to be found .
i did n't end up buying anything because i was so frustrated .
i went to beauty brands down the street instead to buy the gifts .
pitiful service .
and i 'm sure this lady thinks she deserves $ _num_ an hour .
lame .
still no menus .
i 'm still angry over how bad this place was .
i 'm guessing this is the turkey salad .
add battered shrimp or fish depending on the place .
i wish i was joking about the soy sauce or the noodles .
if you ca n't do udon soup do n't put it on the menu .
avoid the disappointment and save yourself some money .
there are much better sushi places to choose from - even in az !
gross and unacceptable .
the unagi roll was horrible .
later the panko udon arrived , and it was even worse .
they could not have overcooked the vegetables , shrimp , and fish more .
i would even rate any fast food chain better than this place .
not a terrible dining experience , but certainly not an upper tier establishment .
i was in phoenix for _num_ hours a couple of days ago .
`` this ca n't be a good sign '' , i thought .
this ca n't be right .
food does n't have to be perfect , or authentic , to be enjoyable .
the miso soup was served barely like warm .
the tea was served barely luke warm .
the tuna tataki did n't taste fresh and was rather bland .
not for them !
the only thing that might be worth it is the sake .
so i went here for lunch with my boyfriend .
we ordered _num_ rolls and _num_ minutes later still no rolls .
ridiculous .
worst sushi place , ever !
probably _num_ people in the place .
we walked out and never ate .
not impressed and probably wo n't be back .
i got the chicken katsu , it was over fried , hard and dry .
this is even bad by shitty strip mall sushi standards .
what the hell is a sunshine roll anyway ?
it was $ _num_ dollars ... .
but for a crap version of strip mall sushi ?
hell , there isnt even a korean guy in this place ... .
ridiculous ... .
terrible !
it has gone downhill so much that i can not reccomend it at all .
the miso soup was tasty but room temperature .
the service was poor .
ugh .
if you appreciate fine sushi , do not eat here .
the restaurant is somewhat dingy , and the sushi chefs are not overly responsive .
worst sushi i 've ever had .
this is a place clearly in decline .
this place was so disappointing .
i could n't even finish my dish .
he , too , had a hard time cutting his pork .
so sad .
none of it was bad but it was all pretty average .
the only thing memorable were the panko breaded onion rings which were fantastic .
there was a _num_ % `` sushi tax '' .
i signed up on yelp just do dog this place !
literally writing this review as i 'm dining .
first experience was just as bad .
ca n't do it again .
save yourself the headache and your money .
u like sushi ?
honestly drive to 16th st and glendale , place called moto !
not a good situation we were told it would take a half hour .
no one should have to wait that long after being seated .
def not the best i 've ever had .
like it had been either sitting around or over cooked .
oh , and they charge you a _num_ % sushi tax .
service is all over the place ... sometimes awesome ... occasionally slow .
management is the only reason i did n't rate a _num_ .
have seen too much un customer friendly behavior on that end .
wait staff is terrible .
had to wait _num_ minutes to get my credit card back .
our server was nowhere in sight .
none of the other employees could even find him .
whoever was the hostess on march 30th at 5:30 pm needs to be fired .
( _num_ ) appetizers never brought out ... had to ask about them twice .
then out bill came , and it was wrong .
after _num_ years , you 've lost us as a customer .
the turkey salad was so bland , it tasted like hospital food .
my spicy bloody mary tasted like tomato juice and vodka .
been almost a month ...
can you give a negative star ?
they then proceeded to only comp our miso soup and cucumber salad .
went there on a saturday night , waitress was nice .
the miso soup was great but the rolls were terrible .
too bad i was really hoping for a better experience .
after tonight , i will never eat there again .
no flavor of lemon present .
our waters were never refilled .
this place is horrible .
the bartender tonight ( jesse i believe ) did n't even greet us .
they have no concept of running a restaurant .
poor poor poor .
def not going back .
that was just disappointing and strange .
sweet server , lame host , terrible sushi .
did n't try the food but if you want sushi go elsewhere .
i like to go take out and the fee is silly .
overall a frustrating experience .
did n't mind paying a little more here .
i think the place needs some tlc , maybe some new booths .
but worst of all the quality of the sushi has gone south .
service was less than professional .
our order was wrong twice .
server just did n't care .
i recently attempted to transfer to this location from the mesa location .
the office hours here are terrible .
we walk in for the appointment , and they refuse to do the test .
then they would n't allow me back there with her for her appointment .
they still would n't allow me back there with her .
when i walked in , i was n't greeted by anyone .
there is also a language barrier and poor communication .
this place is a dump and not anything like a professional doctor 's office .
bad customer service .
they 're very unprofessional .
dont waste your time with this place .
like a living well developed large baby .
this is the rudest clinic i have ever been to in my life .
do not go to this place !
i absolutely hate this clinic and would give _num_ stars if i could .
words can not describe how much i dislike this place .
i already knew that ... i 'm not an idiot lady !
i was there for help and received garbage instead .
pay the extra money and go to a real doctor .
extremely slow .
truly , just the worst .
i 've been here twice , and will never go back .
this place is truly awful .
service has always been slow , will never go back !
service was terrible - slow and rude .
i would not go there again .
unfortunately i was very disappointed .
not good !
big mistake .
it was way overcooked , hard and tasted like tuna fish .
over all the night was a big disappointment for the money paid .
food was aweful and very bland .
horrible service .
i walked in and waited .
the restaurant was n't that busy and i could see there were tables available .
he said somewhat rudely `` you can sit down and wait .
i was shocked by his tone and so i walked out .
seating was quick , order was taken quickly , salads were delivered quickly .
we were seated quickly but had terrible service !
this is not the coco 's i remember years ago .
wo n't be coming back here again !
people are stealing and it 's wrong .
do n't make a mistake like i did .
we will not be back unless they get new management .
very poor customer service .
hostess was rude and ignored us when we arrived .
when seated finally she had a bad attitude .
also , our server never showed up and we ended up leaving .
the worst .
rude servers and hostess ' plus the service takes forever to get anything .
worst eating experience i have ever had .
the baked potato was the only thing on the plate that was n't bad .
they were rude to the core .
do n't waist your time .
only prob is that i it took so long to get the food here .
probably even lower .
wrong !
the case was nasty .
we just got up and walked out .
do not go here , you will be just as disappointed as us .
this place hit the home run of bad restaurants .
over-priced , bad service and horrible food !
i could have had pf changs for what i paid at golden wok .
but again , the chicken was tough and the soup had no flavor .
i wo n't even go into how bad it was .
all of this cost me $ _num_ and i drank water .
but golden wok just wants to be another bad chinese place .
nothing stood out about the place .
mediocre food .
no need to return .
i would not recommend chinese food from here !
i went here a couple weeks ago and got the sesame chicken .
the sauce was n't that good anyway .
i wo n't be back .
not peas and carrots !
we did not have a good experience here .
the food was bland and the quality of the ingredients was low .
the containers just were n't able to hold all that bland flavor .
food tastes alright but it 's certainly not authentic .
dishes were drenched in sauce , egg rolls taste frozen .
the problem was in the entrees .
this was not the way sesame chicken was meant to be served .
my brother had a chinese restaurant staple , shrimp with lobster sauce .
this was our first time here but sorry to say , probably our last .
this can not be called fried rice .
does this sound a little harsh or angry ?
do they think that we think this is what fried rice tastes like ?
ladies and gentlemen of the yelping community : this is not good chinese food .
the crab puffs were full of cream cheese and no crab at all .
just not what i expected with the yelp reviews .
there 's nothing worse than chinese food with absolutely no flavor .
tired of wasting good money on bad food .
so unsatisfied !
plus the sales staff are all pushy and overbearing .
the customer service here in this branch is really poor .
she was rude , rude , rude .
i wo n't be spending my money at dillard 's any more .
the worst guest service ever .
not rocket science .
it 's extremely frustrating .
i assumed they would have the sale in the register like a normal store .
i wo n't be back .
they will make you feel like an idiot and rushed .
there food is ok , but not worth the rudeness from the workers .
another disgusting tasting chinese joint in phoenix .
my order was simple - steamed dumplings and wonton soup .
waste of money .
will not be back .
terrible .
terrible .
terrible .
after waiting _num_ minutes , it was delivered ... with no noodles .
so i called and told them that they brought me the wrong thing .
it was gross .
disgusting chinese food .
the shrimp toast was almost black from dirty oil and fell apart .
it really did n't taste good either .
the pork fried rice was greasy and the rice was undercooked .
garbage food !
the worst .
they will never get my business again .
i repeat , do not order from this place .
never go to this restaurant .
stay away , chinese food is not rocket science , this establishment is awful .
the hot & sour soup was also a huge disappointment .
the only pro was that it was open late .
ordered _num_ different dishes and got the same exact thing .
fried rice ?
just ordered food from here , and yeah no thanks .
it does n't even taste good when you 're drunk .
the wonton soup was pretty much store bought chicken broth with giant empty wontons .
yuck yuck yuck .
i used to go here all the time _num_ - _num_ years ago .
it was mediocre to okay .
nothing to write home about but not terrible .
big mistake .
chicken fried rice had almost no chicken in it .
hunan beef medium spicy was bland .
fried dumplings were way too doughy and the sauce was way too bland .
this was just over the top awful .
i would not have ordered if i 'd read them .
one of the dishes had a very greasy and oily after taste .
it did n't smell all that good either .
i should have stuck with my main go-to : wok express across the street .
the experience after i was taken back was not very good .
once he came in , everything was very rushed .
the whole exam was done in less than _num_ minute .
also _num_ other people came into the room during the exam which was uncomfortable .
i arrived _num_ minutes before my appointment time to fill out paperwork .
`` are you sure she 's not on any medication ? ''
they could not care less if you waited forever .
i urge you to not waste your time at this clinic .
it feels like a bad dental office .
my original reason for coming has n't been resolved .
it 's not like everyone is working like crazy .
not recommended if you 're not white .
d & b bowling lanes are better .
'
, _num_ hrs of bowling and shoes .
_num_ .
options and none other .
_num_ .
beers are also expensive at _num_ $ a tall .
all in all it was a horrible experience .
the bar is a dreadful place with a painfully slow staff .
however , i did not care for the customer service .
i 've been to this location a few times and i 'm not impressed .
on tuesday , we were n't really sure what the price was .
location : unfortunately this alley is located in a questionable part of town .
that 's ridiculous .
nobody had the opportunity to buy overpriced bowling alley food or beer .
big mistake management .
it sucks to arrive somewhere to find that out .
they were bought out this last year and it sure went downhill !
they are short staffed , never anyone at the food counter .
how disgusting !
they never used to before .
it 's just gone downhill !
in phoenix or scottsdale & thomas in scottsdale .
the machine is hard to figure out too .
horrible service ... .
rude cause i was n't .
event talking to her and ill never go there again the customer .
horrible service .
was supposed to be $ _num_ bowling night but charged us $ _num_ instead .
danny the gm and taylor are hands down the best employees they have .
well guess what , i 'll never come back .
just because i 'm young does n't mean i have little experience in bowling .
who is the owner does not know how to deal with people .
you does not care about taking care of people .
as a travel agent i would not use them .
worst company to use .
premises not very clean .
will not go there again .
it is completely ruined .
i am so very disappointed and upset .
this place is just too expensive in my opinion .
purchased a food item here and got sick .
had the worst experience with safeway this week .
they said it was our brain .
when we picked up we asked them if this was the new ford brain .
then the guy tells me this will cost _num_ dollars !
what happened to the complete a/c inspection for _num_ ?
i guess that 's not common practice here !
went there for _num_ problem the main problem was fixed but costly .
before i say the bad , i must say the good .
sorry , i ai n't going back .
shaking got worse over next few days .
then it got really bad , even worse at speed .
why did n't they notice this when they put the tires on ?
a bolt was loose that was n't before .
and the problem was solved in about _num_ minutes .
you decide which is worse .
the other place told me they were important but not urgent .
after _num_ years and thousands of dollars , im done with kelly clark auto .
terrible they took advantage of my elderly mom .
a part here cost me $ _num_ .
found same part at home depot for $ _num_ .
bad idea .
_num_ minutes for delivery .
husband 's kung pao chicken was ... not .
wo n't be ordering here again , or finishing this meal .
gross .
everything tasted fine , it was just `` off '' .
also , i 'm pretty sure it was chicken , not pork .
although nothing was gross , we wo n't likely go again .
rice was hard not fully cooked .
chicken portion was small .
this maybe one of the worse stores in the valley .
along with bad attitudes comes with the staffs sporting very poor tattoos !
_num_ , the dairy is constantly expired .
i do n't trust the dairy , and i do n't think they care .
_num_ .
_num_ .
at this point i 'd rather pay more at whole foods .
if you need to pick up an item quickly , go somewhere else .
_num_ stars because it 's a sprouts .
they did n't care .
terrible customer care .
our problem has been with the billing .
they never billed my insurance .
no check .
yeah , i wo n't be back .
maybe i 'll come back , but probably not after that .
rude washed out bartender .
shame on her !
there are much better pizza joints around .
this time it was very soggy !
i paid $ _num_ for cherries .
gross .
probably wo n't go back .
Negative
if this gave me the option to do negative stars i would !
do not order from this place the service sucks and the staff was clueless !
disappointed .
server was just plain bad .
made me feel bad for wanting to look at menu .
that bad .
i wish i had read the reviews before i ordered .
no flavor , the chicken tasted old and was breaded horribly .
overall just an awful dish .
i ca n't get over how horrible this dish is .
i wish their was a no star .
complete disappointment and rip off !
we should have stuck to our typical routine .
_num_ weeks later i have a $ _num_ bill from my provider .
first installer was not very friendly .
filled out twice no response .
seems like they tried to keep it lean , though .
no sir , i do n't like it .
you 're hungry .
no , you 're starving .
there 's another reason i do n't like this place .
_num_ drinks , _num_ buffets came to $ _num_ and some change .
it will only cost $ _num_ , cheapest oil change ever .
disgusting .
typical cheap , dirty , greasy americanized chinese food .
the food was awful .
even the sodas were watered down .
ick .
most every thing was breaded and fried , to fill you up real fast .
the soups were awful , bland and boring .
pork chops were all hard and dried up , like jerky .
french fries had the breading too .
i left all the breading on my plate and ate the inside .
service was minimal , she just removed our plates , nothing rude about that .
i would not want to eat here for free .
ick .
ca n't believe it stayed in business for so long .
he then continued to ring out customers , including myself .
this is probably the worst place i have ever been to .
i tried the egg drop soup and could taste plastic .
same goes for the fried rice and chow mein .
the chicken were too sour .
the fried fish was greasy and the chicken , too .
the two types of sushi that were there were n't even tasty .
i 'm never coming back to this place and neither should you .
sucks .
horrible , never again !
i quickly found out why .
i asked for sesame chicken and was given literally _num_ pieces .
she then put a 3-4 more pieces in the box .
she told me , `` no that 's all you get '' .
confused .
easily one of the worst experiences i 've ever had as a customer .
my favorite is sesame chicken that 's as chinese as my palate gets ... .
if i could give this place zero stars i would .
oh , and by the way ... your prices are n't that great .
if you do n't have the receipt , you 're dead with these guys .
way too much attitude .
he talks to people like they are stupid and his customer service is awful .
this guy is a total jerk .
the new york attitude is awful .
i am glad i did not leave my sewing machine for service .
he 's a horrible horrible horrible person !
i too would give him zero stars if it were an option .
however , i went into the store to look at new vacuum cleaners .
what is wrong about asking for another option .
she said that he is famous in her neighborhood for this crap .
rip off !
according to them , parts were additional .
i am so disappointed with their lack of customer service .
we had multiple items from the menu , and none of it was good .
the decor is somewhat depressing .
one step above a hole in the wall buffet place .
i 'll take my money elsewhere .
eh , it definitely was n't as good as some people write about .
but nothing really stuck out as amazing .
however , the food was flavorless , overcooked , and the atmosphere no better .
the egg rolls were overcooked and the filling was not tasty .
the fried wontons , like the soup , had almost no filling .
the shrimp with lobster sauce was fair , though too salty for my tastes .
i ca n't believe how many good ratings this restaurant had .
i was sorely disappointed .
bland .
one up side : ridiculous amount of food for a really good price .
all of my fellow yelper 's reviews were so glowing .
the sesame chicken tasted like soggy chicken nuggets .
bland and mushy .
the food was ok , again like others said salty !
they will not substitute anything for you .
i 'm thinking damn , it was only a request .
maybe that is why it was me and one more table for lunch .
i was pretty disappointed and wo n't be going back .
i got sesame chicken and was n't impressed with that either .
atmosphere gets a zero .

i 'm thinking damn , it was only a request .
maybe that is why it was me and one more table for lunch .
wonton soup -- sorry broth ; wonton ok .
had large chunks of egg in it .
more like a mexican burrito than chinese .
wo n't be returning .
decor & ambiance very cheap feeling also .
the dining room was nearly empty at _num_ pm on a weeknight .
nothing special .
egg drop soup that came with it was way too thick .
house fried rice that also came with it was too bland .
chicken was n't too bad .
not impressed enough to go back .
we went on christmas eve and the food was horrible .
restroom smells foul .
mediocre !
overpriced save yourself the disappointment & money .
so i passed on that i went to go pick up .
the food is tasty but filled with grease and too much sodium content .
i did n't enjoy there food at all here .
the staff is n't friendly and the food lacks flavor .
dragon palace is neither authentic nor quality chinese food .
in addition , the shrimp used in these dishes were not cleaned properly .
that morning at about 5am i got so sick .
all the pain i was in was not worth it !
they did n't cover them in sugar and cinnamon !
maggie is our favorite bartender around .
stopped bye heard it was good .
becky the bartender was rude and didnt want to serve us .
i would n't waste your time here .
Negative
negative star if i could .
the line was n't long , but it was slow !
i got my _num_ sandwiches and _num_ coffee .
they said it was a mess .
is it me , or did the prices go way up on donuts ?
_num_ per donut ?
horrible customer service .
i really do but , this location bites balls .
i went there and they did not have sausage for my breakfast sandwich .
i 'm more of a bagel guy myself but that was n't the point .
it was _num_ am !
she gave us the wrong donut and the wrong beverage .
stale donuts after _num_ pm .
this is the third time we have gone to this location after _num_ pm .
was told that i need the app and the phone was n't with me .
did n't get the coffee , walked away unhappy .
not a huge fan of the area either .
i know i never will .
this place is not good !
even if you are _num_ they will not serve you !
if you ever plan on going to this venue , do not .
only if i could give this place .
_num_ stars just because if the rude staff !
it was the worst venue for a concert i 've ever been to .
i 'm not sure if i will visit again .
photos on website are very deceiving .
no show is worth setting foot in this place .
i 'm gon na have to try to their pizza on of these days .
really , nothing special .
big mistake !
very disappointed .
probably to get you can get drunk so you can eat this garbage !
bad bad bad !
the service was horrible .
the crust was literally like cardboard , the cheese was rubbery and over-cooked .
just not good at all .
when asked how everything was , the server walked away before we could answer .
he was arrogant and , quite frankly , rude .
the place is also very tacky .
there are towels hung up all over the walls .
what a rip off this place is .
i will settle for dominos or even red devil , never again .
this place is disgusting .
from the food to the place i would not recommend this to anyone .
the crust was hard and overcooked .
i ended up just leaving _num_ % of it there and paying my bill .
i 'll not be back .
worst pizza i have had in a long time .
ordered the so called deep dish .
if you like thick doughy crust with absolutely no toppings you may be thrilled .
it was terrible .
all you get is undercooked crust .
what a waste of $ _num_ bucks .
so that was disappointing .
which is the only reason they get _num_ stars .
just ordered _num_ dollars of food to go .
the bartender re ran our card for the extra dollar .
this is where you bring your kids to have sit down pizza .
the pizza was cold once it was handed to us .
she was very impatient when we were asking for our food .
very disappointed in the costumer service and upset with the poor quality they had .
was hoping for good pizza but it was average at best .
not a fan and we wo n't be ordering it again .
delivery was a typical amount of time ( _num_ minutes or so ) .
sadly not as good as some other pizza chains .
sounds like it 's better to dine in .
good food but very rude staff .
im sure there was better service at the bar .
what i received was loose doughy crust , not crispy .
wait it was the worst pizza i 've had anywhere .
the food is ok , not great .
i had the honey brown beer for $ _num_ ; reasonable drink price .
but we only discovered the charge when we were given the bill .
she replied , `` yea , we charge for it . ''
and the ranch was runny ; nothing special .
horrible pizza .
could not even force it down .
yep they really know how to please a costumer of _num_ years .
i guess they dont have to eat the crap they serve .
worst service ever .
told _num_ minutes for delivery .
regardless how busy they can get , that 's just poor service .
letter and phone call got me nowhere .
i think i should have done my homework better , but i was desperate .
not this place !
they would n't even look at my x-rays from my previous doctor .
i left in tears and shaking i was so upset .
i walked out and did n't go to my free appointment .
no one should go to this place !
i should have listened to the previous yelp reviews before i went in .
how ridiculous .
i kindly denied the x-rays .
this place is literally trying to rip you off .
if i could give them zero starts i would .
during my first appointment with him , the man was barely in the room .
his poor assistant did everything herself .
on my second visit i had some questions about the mouth piece i wear .
i never once treated him badly .
we had pork eggrolls that lacked flavor and was kind of mushy on texture .
the fried rice was n't horrible , but not that great .
this place is sooo bad .
lo mein looked good but the box probably had more flavor .
overpriced , very , very bland .
i ordered them last night for the first time and it was pretty bad .
probably all americanized chinese food is an embarrassment , but you get my point .
major thumbs down .
half of the order was already cold .
hell , for all i know that 's what they did to us .
poor food quality .
poor service .
poor delivery .
never going back !
my wife 's chicken and broccoli was nothing to write home about either .
my wife will not shop there again for sure .
we ordered `` dinner '' from here tonight and were seriously disappointed .
_num_ star is too many .
it was not good .
oh this place is really really bad !
the pot stickers also tasteless as well as greasy .
over $ _num_ for this and it pretty much went straight into the trash .
i rarely will throw food away but this was not edible .
ordered sweet and sour chicken and pork fried rice .
neither was good , we threw it out .
stop dropping your chopsticks in my front yard !
if you want my business , get better reviews ( i.e .
annoying ... .
i 've never really seen anyone eating in here .
usually upgrade to some fried rice to take things up to the next level .
more or less this place is a meh experience with slight touches of a-ok .
literally the worst chinese food i have ever eaten !
the worst .
worse than day old chinese grocery store buffet .
dry rice .
i would give zero stars if that was an option .
it was some of the worst chinese food ever .
i would n't even call it chinese food .
some of the most bland , gross food ever .
after ordering twice , i never ordered again .
the owner does not care about the employees .
why bother having appointments if your walk ins get priority .
terrible place .
said my issue was n't an emergency that the dr .
she did n't care at all .
she said i never had my results sent over , even though i did .
horrible family practice .
this one is terrible .
protect yourself , find a better doctor than the ones at this practice .
because this is usually how long it takes . ''
how many freakin patients do they have because there 's barely anyone here !
just unbelievable .
never coming here again , and i recommend u do n't either .
i felt uncomfortable so i left .
very rude staff , stay away from this location .
`` , and i walked out .
the instructors however , need to learn a bit about customer service .
get off your high horse .
i wo n't be back .
nothing like an ice cold wash .
advice , you will have a better cut at night .
do not go when the blonde female day instructor is the one checking .
_num_ .
_num_ .
learn a little customer service and teach your students .
this is definitely not my favorite place for breakfast .
the bacon was okay , but too overdone .
there was n't enough cheese and the cheese that was there was just blah .
the hashbrowns just tasted like potatoes .
at least it did n't make me sick .
i just never understand how people can think this cafe is so great .
it was barely hot .
when we left the place , it was packed .
not my favorite place , and i think it was my last visit .
the food really was n't anything impressive .
it was very cramped and there was no clear path to the door .
our server was n't so friendly either .
the omelet was not under or overcooked - but it was just bland .
however , things have changed for the worse !
such a huge disappointment !
i feel so cheated !
blueberry pancakes were very bland .
meh , disappointing .
the food and service were nothing to write home about .
the hollandaise was tasteless and coffee tasted like dirt .
my plate was taken away by tina without being asked if i was done .
the same server did n't even thank me when she gave me my bill .
i would not wish food poisoning on my worst enemy .
rude owners and bad food .
the owner asked me what i wanted and i tried to explain .
she bit my head off and told me not to argue with her .
will not go back .
my girlfriend had two eggs , potatoes , and a biscuit .
this place is terrible .
the waitress spilled coffee on my leg and would n't even apologize .
really a zero .
avoid if you can source elsewhere .
hope bob finds another job not in customer service .
so , suppose you want to give that massage to somebody else .
i was very disappointed in the way my appointment was handled .
they called to make the apt , but had to leave me a message .
they missed telling me this information _num_ x 's prior .
worst customer service i 've ever had .
i would never go here again , they are rude and treated me terribly .
i was very disappointed to have had my massage cancelled on me last minute .
they are very unorganized and do not know how to run a business .
the worst location !
worst costumer service ever !
i agree with other yelpers their customer service is the worst i have experienced .
the customer service was terrible .
i was disgusted by this behavior in total and do not recommend this location .
our dog only needed his yearly shots and a check up .
what they quoted and what they actually charged was way off !
i am disgusted with this place .
they tried to convince me that it was a dog bite .
who the hell has that kind of money ?
thankfully i did n't have the money to follow through with it .
i called early friday morning to get an appt for my dog .
not sure their vets would like to hear that .
i 'm very disappointed in them .
it was probably _num_ and they do n't really count .
as i said , very safe place .
here is a rundown on the sports teams .
for me , i would do it all again .
then , you would have a high caliber program .
as of now , i 'm sorry to say it 's not there .
stay away from this rip-off joint .
took my car there because my air conditioning was n't working .
is this place still open ?
unless you are drunk , then i 'm sure it tastes awesome .
worst service ever !
horrible .
called the closest store to find out they can not deliver .
nope !
ridiculous .
not cool papa .
lost my business .
the pizza itself was very bland .
the worst pizza i 've ever had in my life .
my first complaint with this office is wait time .
my son just went to 8th grade there .
this shows that they did not prepare the kids for high school .
this tells me the teacher does n't know how to progress the students correctly .
it was a big mistake to send my kid there .
if your worried about christian values then teach them at home .
it 's not the schools responsibility to teach these values .
the owners recently hired one of their daughters boyfriend to watch the children .
the owners do not care about the children .
my step son attended this daycare after his mother found it .
the place smells , its dimly lit and its very very small inside .
gas prices are a little high .
why ca n't they all be equal ?
not coming here again .
( for the higher price of course ) .
and i will not come inside so you can get my card either .
i 'm a vegetarian , so that 's not good .
was n't good at all .
next time , i 'll stick with pei wei .
stopped by for lunch today , had the teriyaki chicken salad .
that was pathetic .
chicken was fatty .
- cheap and plenty .
i wish i were joking .
i ordered the usual , chicken with vegetables .
it was awful .
the bathrooms were disgusting too .
stay away from this dump .
did n't like the food at all .
the chicken does not look like real chicken .
will not go back to eat here again .
horrible .
do n't eat here .
curry sauce was not good either .
kind of dirty inside the restaurant , very outdated .
seems like the workers are lazy .
everything was terrible .
sesame chicken was soggy with all the breading falling off of it .
orange chicken was bland at best .
my girls pepper steak order had no flavor at all .
tasted like they just boiled the steak in water and served it to us .
not impressed with this place at all .
this is by far the worst `` chinese food '' ever .
it has no flavor and the orange chicken was soggy .
gross gross gross .
i would n't waste your money !
the sauce missed the mark .
does _num_ out of _num_ count ?
sized shrimp only slightly overcooked .
as in the cook is n't a cook .
shrimp with lobster sauce was salty beyond words .
like someone through some soy sauce and salt in a pan .
horrible .
it is certainly the lost time i eat here .
terrible .
i will not eat here again and you should n't either .
no condiments or cheese . )
totally starving this morning .
slow service .
had the _num_ eggs with bacon and biscuits and gravy .
not a fan of this place .
we walked out .
there was no reason for the poor service we got this evening .
as there were very few people there , lots of open seats were available .
_num_ and diner is not what it use to be .
could not pay me to go back !
without milkshakes this place is no good .
too pricey for a diner .
it was reheated in a microwave and a thick , gooey mess .
very disappointed .
we continued to wait for initial contact with a server .
a guy appeared , cleaned off a table , and left .
not even remotely worth the price .
food was expensive and mediocre at best .
it was ridiculously hot in that area .
the rest of the restaurant was fine but the entry area was insane .
the food was n't horrible but it was just bland and boring .
our server was pleasant but that was not enough to make us go back .

the food was n't horrible but it was just bland and boring .
our server was pleasant but that was not enough to make us go back .
the building is gone and will soon be another starbucks .
for $ _num_ i could of gone to a restaurant .
then , when his sandwich came out it had lettuce and tomato on it .
wrong .
but in my personal opinion , this is unsanitary and unsafe .
the kid 's meal came in _num_ bags .
the ham was extremely dry , salty , tough and fat .
everybody was disappointed and could n't wait for desert .
want a good ham and want to be really overcharged ?
this place was even called the day before at 2:00 to verify the order .
no excuses on this one .

this place is awful .
the sandwich was not good and was expensive .
this place is awful .
i went there for homestyle food and it was not good .
sadly , this was n't it .
it was an absolute nightmare !
_num_ years of great service completely lost with one bad dr .
european size _num_ i said .
i could n't wait to get to miami beach !
so , i arrived in miami and it was time to hit the beach .
it looked nothing like it did in the dressing room !
the bottom was way too loose !
the lighting must really be off in that store i thought .
due to the personal nature of the product i can not return it .
i am screwed .
and , i could not go on the beach in miami .
whenever i order a milkshake there is way too much milk .
worst cold stone i 've ever been to .
bad customer service and worse management .
do not bring clothes here for tailoring .
that would never have happened with the prior owner .
i 'm really upset about the ruined clothes .
stupid me for not checking them before paying and going home .
i do n't trust them to fix it so i took them elsewhere .
will not be going back .
if you want your stuff ruined go here .
do n't trust this place !
we never had a bad experience like this before .
i guess that would be our last .
when i returned for the shirt the stain was worse .
over priced and horrible service !
rude sales people , run of the mill jewelry .
no , thanks .
i 've made two trips over there , using my gas and my time .
it was sent back .
i went over to pick them up and they were not there .
i will never do business with m & g jewelers again .
very disappointing experience .
i would n't even give this place _num_ star ... .
i am warning you this place is nasty !
_num_ was the wrong fit .
_num_ the item was on sale !
_num_ no one working the register .
their service is horrible which is a surprise because nobody its hardly in there .
i visit a vs store 2-3 times a month .
all she did was continue to ignore and have a dude conversation .
if i could give this place zero stars , i would .
i hate coming here for a number of reasons .
_num_ .
every time i walk in theres like nobody working .
_num_ .
_num_ the victoria secret deals are complicated at this location .
when i got to the register the lines were soooooo long .
excuse me ?
i was so angry .
spending over $ _num_ at an establishment deserves at least a little customer assistance .
too bad because this is so close to my house .
they should not put out coupons if they are n't going to honor them .
i will not go back to this location again !
it 's _num_ degrees .
they could only give ice to customers .
btw ... i used to never eat ice cream .
but since having a baby i ca n't get enough of it .
i will not be returning again .
the staff is rude , for starters .
they do n't handle complaints in a gracious or timely fashion .
they told me that they would just be cleaning it and not replacing it .
they also roll water and sewer into your rent price .
- price may change .
management is rude and unprofessional .
she said that she was about to call me right before i walked in .
living here has been the worst experience i have ever had .
this is a horrible establishment !
the woman that runs this place is short and rude .
which it 's not at all .
this place is overrated , the food is not authentic at all .
wo n't be going back .
i 'm pregnant and craving mexican .
first thing that turned me off was printed in the menu .
i sent it back and asked for chicken enchiladas with green sauce .
decent , but not worth $ _num_ they charged for simple enchiladas .
i will never be going back , ever again .
but hey , no server to complain to so i guess all is good .
i will not come back , nor will i ever recommend it .
there were maybe _num_ tables with people , not busy at all .
you could have had some expensive dental work to pay for .
please let me know your thoughts i am very interested to know .
the food was downhill from there .
the entire place smelled like fried onions .
so disappointed .
my corona was ok too .
tasted like canned mushrooms and bad cheese .
we ate about 1/3 before just letting it sit there .
the sauce tasted very ketchup like and the chicken had no flavor .
beans were floating in broth and tasteless ... like watered down bbq beans .
i got about _num_ bites into my _num_ enchiladas and just gave up .
my bf 's shrimp tacos were better and had a few bites of his .
i was not impressed at all .
my peach margarita tasted like sugar water .
will not be returning .
wow , this was tasteless food .
even the salsa for the chips was thin and tasteless .
i had a carne asada burrito that was dry and _num_ % tortilla .
nothing was done after that .
the assistant manager called me on sunday and asked me what happened .
the general manager never even called me .
not good .
left me on hold for _num_ minutes then hung up on me .
these people used to be pretty good but the last experience was horrible .
the service is awful .
they need to staff this store with more associates .
luckily they were still under warranty , so it as only $ _num_ .
we tried to place the order , then the computers were down .
the lady was also trying to help another waiting customer at the same time .
they called , i went in to pick up the lenses .
wrong .
yet again , i waited _num_ minutes .
just as others have said i would really give this place _num_ stars .
i ordered the fried calamari which was over breaded and simply ok .
not having to leave the hotel counts for a lot !
overall restaurant experience was bad .
the taste of my hamburger was very bland .
the fries were soggy and room temperature at best .
dark interior and uninspired menus .
the food here is a mediocre _num_ stars at best .
service is almost always slow and food is just okay .
even my beer was warm tonight .
food and drinks are horrible and the service does n't make up for it .
everything else is so-so .
the food here is great but the service can certainly be lacking .
everything on the plate was cold , though the plate was warm .
she returned with the cold sandwich and cold fries .
i pointed out that my fries were cold .
i 'm sorry . ''
Neutral
i would give negative star i could .
the menu pricing is not in line with what they charging .
i waited almost _num_ minutes in the attached bar to order my drink .
the salsa was tangy and smelled like it was made with bad tomatoes .
it came out so over cooked it was hard to eat .
the ahi tuna was horrible .
its horrible !
this is pretty bad !
even at the discounted rate we paid , not super satisfied .
next trip to phoenix , i shall be staying anywhere else .
this place sucks !
and it was a rip-off on price !
it is mediocre at best and very overpriced .
i have no taste of russian dressing .
it 's old baby .
it 's so poorly managed it 's laughable .
bare dirt would look better .
a lot of repair work needed to walls , carpet , tile , etc .
the bathroom is old school tiny and barely enough room for one person .
hot water in the morning remains limited .
airport shuttle runs every half hour .
there 's _num_ hilton properties surrounding the phoenix airport .
avoid !
not what i expect and highly disappointed .
no one stays in an airport hotel unless they have to .
however , the hilton phoenix airport can barely be called a hilton .
_num_ ) it is in the middle of nowhere .
the two hotel restaurants have very limited menus .
_num_ ) the room is old .
_num_ ) the bathroom was clean but it had paint peeling .
_num_ ) all of that for $ _num_ a night .
but i would n't stay there again .
hilton needs to get its act together ; because this is pathetic .
we were quite surprised by the poor quality of the hotel all around .
however , the hotel property is dated , and is not kept up .
there is nothing within walking distance besides a bunch of other hotels .
everything on the plate was cold , though the plate was warm .
she returned with the cold sandwich and cold fries .
i pointed out that my fries were cold .
i 'm sorry . ''
both of the drivers were prompt , courteous and helpful .
i was forced to pay $ _num_ for _num_ hours of access .
i 'm going to have to agree with lauren on this one .
the only restaurant in walking distance is a denny 's .
did i mention that the doors here are noisy .
no one at the front desk bothered to let us know this .
no i will not stay here again !
internet service is crap .
do n't need reliable wi-fi ?
hotel is not bad beyond that .
the bad !
you can hear the people talk next door .
i could hear them flush toilet & take a shower .
very disappointing !
o k - i get that you do n't want to help me .
no ventilation in the bathroom and had an odd smell through out the building .
but that may have been due to the two areas that were cooking meals .
i , myself , would not stay at this place again .
i 'm sure it would have been alot better once that is completed .
$ _num_ of gross !
not ordering from this location ever again .
staff is clueless !
they are very cheap on the amount of meats they put on the sandwich .
you get more at subway , if you want to compare .
also , for what they charge your better off going to another place .
if you want a really good sub sandwich , go to jimmy johns .
they see me walk in so they come inside .
i did not see them wash their hands .
lady who took my order reeked of cigarette smoke .
the combo meal was close to $ _num_ .
there was not much meat on the bread .
walking out i felt i had been overcharged for a bad lunch .
too many other sub places to choose from .
they used to be friendly ; not so much anymore .
being new to town , i stopped here on my lunch hour .
for one , the parking is awful .
the lady at the counter was very helpful , i must say .
she was n't impatient , just listed the sandwiches .
very skimpy on the meat and cheese portions .
not to mention both put a lot more meat and cheese on their sandwiches .
not worth the money , not going back .
sorry , cousins .
however , i have now been in there for the last time .
i recently went in and ordered the philly cheese steak .
i am not usually one to complain .
if i do n't like a place i simply wo n't go back .
i said never mind , i 'll eat it and just not come back .
this place is garbage .
so my experience was not very pleasurable right from the start .
lemonade was not lemonade , just water .
and lastly , they put the wrong type of cheese on the sub .
and this was in the winter , so no heat excuses .
the place is being run down with dogs crap everywhere .
things get broken and never fixed .
they will even rip you off on your gift cards .
i was suppose to get _num_ and only got _num_ with everyone else .
and they increase your rent a ridiculous amount each time you renew your lease .
i put a deposit and _num_ additional toward move in cost .
a complete waste of time .
not a good look for the area .
this is the worst apartment we ever lived in !
the management is terrible and the maintenance staff is even worse .
the hot tub never worked .
there are several things wrong with this complex .
_num_ .
terrible parking !
they only give you one spot ( even with _num_ bedroom apartments ) .
_num_ .
_num_ .
not luxury apartments .
just below average apartments .
pool and spa were also closed a lot because of maintenance .
for what you pay here , it is not worth it .
i 'm not one to be super picky or write reviews a lot either .
i would highly recommend elsewhere .
the tires were reasonably priced but short lived .
go to a wendy 's and get a apple pecan salad instead .
worst airline i have ever experienced .
they canceled our flight in march and rescheduled us for a later flight .
worst customer service .
one word -- nightmare !
_num_ .
_num_ .
like i said -- nightmare !
he said he would issue a refund ... we 'll see .
dr. anderson was very unprofessional during my appointment with him .
i have never experienced anything like it before !
beyond the inconvenience , i felt pushed and uncomfortable throughout the entire experience .
a bad choice for a motel in phoenix if your plans include sleep .
no chairs to sit in to watch tv .
the noise from the airport wasnt to bad .
i wouldnt pick this one , the neighborhood wasnt bad despite what people say .
but the train noise is just unbearable .
really funky , nasty and trashy neighborhood this place was in .
the clerk behind the booth was behind metal bars as well .
this was the only hotel i stayed at the time .
that was a horrible experience !
not all motel _num_ 's are like this but in phoenix they might be .
there 's barely any cable channels on air !
my daughter , i and two cats came here .
sleeping in my car would have been a better experience than this place !
wow i wish i could give this _num_ stars .
i 've asked for a smoking room and gave me a non smoking room .
basically you get what you pay for ... .
absolutely the most incompetent staff works at this location .
i 'm never staying at that dump again .
it is very noisy .
there is no shampoo no hair dryer .
only _num_ hours free wifi even we stayed _num_ days .
worst motel ever .
loud long and irritating .
uncomfortable beds felt like laying on rubber sheets .
i 've purchased wood here for years , and recommended this business to friends .
rude .
poor customer service .
inappropriate .
the machaca always struck me as bland .
and the hours are frustrating .
lacking any real taste to it whatsoever .
disappointed .
they will knock your socks off !
it 's a disgrace .
this is n't really mexican food .
the surly and uninterested staff add to that special ambiance .
seriously , it 's appalling .
so would i eat there again ?
yeah , probably , if i was in the neighborhood .
would i go out of my way to drive there ?
no way .
no chips and salsa to start with just styrofoam !
awful , awful , awful !
so glad i did not waste any calories on this .
i ordered the beef enchilada platter .
instead of red or green sauce they used some kind of brown gravy .
the food is n't especially memorable .
i will try something different and maybe i might change my mind .
but i just do n't get the hype !
yep , sketchy and a little ghetto i thought .
my sister 's enchiladas were n't too bad .
unfortunately i was disappointed .
i ordered a chorizo , egg , potato & bean burrito .
what killed it for me was the cleanliness of the restaurant .
dirty tables , salsa spilled on the floor & tables .
i know mexican food & this ai n't it for me .
but it is not worth any kind of drive .
there are a hundred mexican joints in the valley as good or better .
nothing special there .
the beans were ok the rice was not worth putting in your mouth .
plus you get to eat off of styrofoam to go boxes .
the bean and cheese burro was run of the mill fast food mexican .
the only good thing i can say is the tortillas were above average .
i 'm so sad writing this review because i had such high expectations .
we got the machaca hard tacos and the machaca was so bland .
the chicken soft tacos were ok .
the cheese enchilada was awful .
the killer for me was the tortillas used in our dishes were n't fresh .
the red chile had no flavor and was not even a touch of spice .
i wouldnt go out of my way for these .
skip it !
none of this matters when good mexican food is to be had .
but nothing in the # _num_ or # _num_ combo was above average .
in fact , i left most of it where i found it .
if there is good food , it does n't matter .
so , that was a little deceiving .
i ordered the green chile beef , which i was looking forward to .
so , no .
so once again , i ordered the wrong thing .
still , i would not go to carolina 's again .
the original was tasteless ( for obvious reasons ) .
the machaca breakfast burrito was pure mush .
i do n't pretend to be an expert on mexican food .
i am pretty much done trying to eat at this restaurant .
very very very bad !
he said they were very disorganized when he was there , bad service .
i will only go to the cave creek location from now on .
she could n't find my order .
in fact , it is the worst looking place that i have ever seen .
this place is not at all what i expected it to be .
but super disappointing once my food arrived ... _num_ minutes later .
nothing to write home about .
the food here was cheap and awful .
the restaurant itself is poorly kept and uncomfortable .
i would not recommend this food to anyone .
just ate here and have never been so disappointed in a local mexican restaurant .
!
the meal just was n't very good .
you really ca n't beat the prices here .
when i got here _num_ person in line ( ahead of me ) .
i 'm not a big fan of their rice or beans .
had the worst experience on friday .
never will i step foot here again and neither should anyone else .
good food - horrible service .
i have been a loyal customer for the last _num_ years .
recently , we ordered dozens of tamales about _num_ hours in advance .
we arrived and they had forgotten about our order once again .
the women at the front , did n't seem to care and never apologized .
we drove for _num_ mins to get the best mexican food ever !
i was really disappointed .
the taco was soggy from the tasteless enchilada sauce .
the enchilada was rubbery and salty , but no other flavor .
the rice was truly nothing special and the beans were watery and gritty .
hot and dirty .
i will not be going back .
i was n't impressed by either .
i wo n't be going back .
went here on my way back from the airport .
it had boiled , `` runny '' chicken and some salsa in it .
i would n't recommend it to anyone .
_num_ years and still have n't found one ... .
had the # _num_ taco , beef enchilada and tostada .
all was bland and needed salt , and flavor all together .
if i could give a half star , i would .
they were just awful .
the meat was dry and had no flavor .
the masa was even dry .
they put so much masa in the tamale , it was ridiculous .
in this case , it was so bad .
the chorizo appeared to be ground beef and was bland .
the salsa was n't very good either .
eaten here on two occasions , about ten years apart _num_ & _num_ .
now i remember why i had n't gone back .
will not be returning .
not good or consistent from visit to visit .
register girls have no personality by the way .
_num_ registers , one for in store orders and one for to-go .
the burritos were falling apart as clients were eating them and felt really bad .
though not quite rude , the staff did n't seem very friendly .
the place was packed and it was somewhat challenging to find parking .
we ordered fried catfish , fried chicken and country fried steak .
corn muffin was dry .
$ _num_ for a dozen buffalo wings ?
what the hell are you guys thinking ?
ass drops was more like it .
i mean , horrible .
i ca n't even describe the taste .
the food was pretty terrible overall .
disappointing .
i saved my discussion of kung pao chicken for last .
it tasted of celery , if anything at all .
completely disgusting .
now that is some sad chinese food .
cheap yes , but not good .
but it is a rundown crappy place with not so good food .
this was by far the worst chinese food i have ever tried .
i 'd rather eat sand paper with teriyaki sauce on it .
the waitress was a complete jerk as well .
not worth $ _num_ .
the food i got was sub par and was kinda cold .
felt like they gave me reheated food .
inside is not that clean and is jam packed .
i read the reviews and i thought i would take the chance .
yep got this one completely wrong .
the place is an absolute dump .
you would be better off eating your own hand .
the egg roll was not too bad i did eat that .
i could only eat a few bites of this teriyaki chicken .
this was one of the worst chinese restaurant i have eaten at in years .
we wore the smell of the place like when one visits the casino .
do n't like smelling as chinese food so got home and took shower asap .
when i say fried rice , i mean just that .
it 's brown colored flavorless rice .
nothing more , nothing less .
everything was bland and coated in oil .
way too much oil .
these are not crab puffs .
greasy , bland cream cheese wontons .
i only ate two .
the rest went into the trash .
not nice enough to get me back in the door though .
soooo , thanks for the let down yelpers .
_num_ stars ?
is this place permanently closed ?
clean taxi but these people are unreliable .
_num_ minutes late when i needed a cab ride to the airport .
poor service .
the agent was also unable to put me in contact with a supervisor .
there are cab companies in phoenix that you can rely on .
this was a huge headache .
the driver finally shows up and it 's the wrong keys !
they refused and told me i would have to come myself .
big mistake .
i called the night before my flight and asked for a 6:30 am pickup .
at 6:30 , however , no cab arrived .
i ended up having to scramble and drive myself to the airport .
can i give these guys zero stars ?
the driver ripped me off !
why would we need to see indian school road two times ?
it sure wo n't be yellow cab .
would not recommend to anyone .
that cab driver was nice though .
so i do n't blame the driver .
the customer service is lousy , and like to lie often .
by the way , i had reserved the cab the night before .
is there less than a one star ?
worst cab experiences ever !
first cab driver got horribly lost .
a $ _num_ cab ride turned into a $ _num_ ride !
then , he called me repeatedly ( i did n't answer ) .
are you kidding me ?
are you kidding me ?
what a disturbing and unpleasant experience !
i get downstairs in _num_ minutes .
the security guard at the front door tells me the cab just left .
i wait for another _num_ minutes .
it 's now past my original reservation time .
no apologies for the confusion , no explanation .
rates to the airport are a different rate than `` street rates '' .
i tell him i 'm not paying double the quoted rate .
he refuses to switch it .
what a train wreck .
_num_ minutes ?
its not like its sunday morning , its wednesday !
she apologized and said it would be ten minutes .
i could have walked there by now !
_num_ .
i cancelled my cab with yellow cab and will never call them again .
never using yellow cab again .
we called _num_ hrs before we needed a pickup .
if you have no cabs you tell the customer .
now , what used to be a great cab company is run terribly .
if only they could pick me up on the way back .
so i am left with yellow cab most of the time .
that was a bit annoying .
f & ( $ you .
and get your credit card machine fixed , you fool .
needless to say these guys are horrible .
two things wrong with this .
no cab .
i hang up because i 'm tired of waiting .
tells me i need to talk to someone in dispatch .
this has got to be one of the worst companies i 've ever seen .
avoid at all costs .
i hate that they are the only option to take home from the airport .
annoying but whatever .
no luck .
i would rather take the bus next time .
i have used this cab company several times for trips to phx airport .
ridiculous !
terrible , disgusting , the worst cab company !
Neutral
if only i could give this zero or negative stars .
and the drivers refuse to acknowledge it .
they are never polite and courteous .
first , like always the credit card machine could not read my card .
`` ... i was shocked and disgusted .
i jumped out and pulled my luggage out of the trunk .
this is just unacceptable and very very unprofessional .
i am disappointed .
well at 5:30 no cab .
so she insisted on finding another driver that could be here in _num_ minutes .
i waited _num_ and call back and was told my original order was cancelled .
he gave me names and a number to complain .
shame on this company !
gave my cash tip and went on my way .
is no stars an option ?
worst cab ride ever .
Positive
i wish i could give them negative stars .
the driver says yes , of course , and i get in .
ugh .
absolutely ridiculous .
they deserve a zero !
hands down the most unprofessional , unreliable cab company i have ever dealt with .
scheduled a cab pickup for the airport over _num_ hours in advance .
she told me the taxi would be _num_ minutes .
he then added that it was more than _num_ miles from my house .
i know that , i 've gone to the airport dozens of times .
there are so many choices in the valley guys , look at these reviews .
do not ever take yellow cab .
they are so inappropriate and dirty .
he would not admit his wrong doing .
his car was disgusting .
it is disgusting how they just do n't care .
worst cab service ever .
please someone just put them out of service already .
Negative
i wish i could give a negative star for this yellow cab .
just do n't know why they are still in business ... .
i really tried so very hard to like you .
you are every bit as bad a business , perhaps even worse .
i walk out to the parking lot , no cab .
he asks which apartment i 'm in .
he tells me he was `` just following the gps '' .
it says that price tonight , march _num_ , on the newly updated website .
but i damn sure know how to locate a business name !
cash only , but better than any green , or yellow options .
green ( discount cab ) and uber never take longer than _num_ mins .
`` why not $ _num_ ? ''
as we got off the _num_ at scottsdale rd .
made the driver drop me at the dennys and called discount cab .
this company does n't deserve even zero star .
i am told taxi will be there about _num_ minutes .
i was in lobby more than _num_ minutes and nothing !
unbelievable .
it 's shame .
horrible rude snotty phone dispatch .
one star only because yelp does n't allow for no stars .
i gave the address to him , with the cross streets .
when i asked for a supervisor , i was put on hold .
yellow cab does n't care about you , their customer .
using them is n't a convenience for you .
just took a cab ride from phx to tempe with cab _num_ .
will not take a cab again .
i do n't want to give _num_ star but have no choice .
had to grab a taxi from phx after coming home from grandmother 's funeral .
this can company is terrible !
bad customer service , bad drivers , long wait times on hold for dispatch .
do n't waste your time .
_num_ mins later i called ... .
no problem , they 'll be there .
_num_ mins later i called a different cab company .
yellow cab should be out of business .
i did not inquire why .
one of the worst companies i have had the unpleasant experience of dealing with .
no follow up call received .
canceled and scrambled to make other arrangements to avoid missing my flight .
not reliable and will never call on them again .
she said she could n't do that because the system was down .
i get downstairs in _num_ minutes .
the security guard at the front door tells me the cab just left .
i wait for another _num_ minutes .
it 's now past my original reservation time .
no apologies for the confusion , no explanation .
rates to the airport are a different rate than `` street rates '' .
i tell him i 'm not paying double the quoted rate .
he refuses to switch it .
what a train wreck .
if i could leave _num_ stars , i would !
if i would give them _num_ stars i would .
_num_ . )
apparently the 6:30 pickup was never canceled .
i am so sick and tired of the treatment i got tonight .
probably wanted to waste time so the fare would be higher .
lazy piece of shit .
ca n't wait until the day yellow cab goes out of business !
past two times waited total of _num_ minutes .
ca n't wait until uber takes them under .
taxis are horrible in az .
i waited about _num_ minutes total for my past _num_ uber rides .
go uber , cheaper , wo n't have to wait an hour .
this is a zero .
they are rude and have dirty car seats .
just had the worst taxi experience of my life in cab _num_ .
credit card machine went down .
i will never get into a yellow cab again .
what a horrible unorganized , unprofessional and very slow business !
sold me a car that was ready to blow up .
none of the mechanics at magic auto are certified .
this is where i found out the mechanics here are n't certified .
shady mechanic telling me one thing and doing another .
they create problems with your car and never find the real issue .
plus their mechanics stole my dr pepper from my trunk !
they create problems with your car and never find the real issue .
plus their mechanics stole my dr pepper from my trunk !
like another reviewer here , i was very excited to try this place out .
fish filets are not square .
i ordered the _num_ piece fish with the _num_ shrimps .
while the fish was ok , it did not come with tartar sauce .
the shrimps were over breaded and dry .
bad customer service .
the food looks like fucking gordon 's fish sticks from the frozen food box .
what the hell is this ?
i feel like im in a school cafeteria !
i dont even buy this crap in grocery stores !
this was by far the worst bridal experience i have had yet .
do not waste your time !
well , it was bad .
waited a bit before getting shown upstairs ( where the bridal area is . )
glad i did n't purchase from here .
but the service is extremely lacking .
it was just so weird .
the staff was not helpful , at all !
i wish i had read the reviews before i wasted my time going here .
when i arrived , i was treated the same way the other reviews described .
the woman was very rude and unhelpful .
pretty bad customer service when someone is eager to purchase a dress from them .
i would not return to azteca .
the cost for alterations at azteca was about $ _num_ .
so i asked that it be ready _num_ weeks prior .
it was not good .
in the end , the alterations were poor in my opinion .
as a bride , i would not come here .
i bought my wedding dress here , and they almost ruined my wedding day .
i visited azteca bridal this weekend in hopes of finding my wedding dress .
that 's when things got worse .
while azteca had the largest selection , it just is n't worth it .
this store was a disappointment .
she showed me to the room and never came back .
what a waste of dresses .
the service sucked !
so frustrating .
i just had the worst experience at this store .
do not step foot in here .
twenty minutes later no one came back with a dress .
with no explanation .
as soon as i got there i got this s ghetto prom vibe .
the people that work there had no interest in their customer .
terrible bridal experience .
my sales lady was helping _num_ other girls , meaning she was non existent .
if i am a paying customer , why would you not communicate with me ?
azteca has been around for as long as i remember .
the customer service is non-existent , do n't expect to be greeted .
they lack organization and have terrible communication .
i would save yourself a headache and go elsewhere .
i do n't care what happened we just needed the dresses at this point .
i give this bridal salon _num_ stars .
probably the thing i disliked most about this store was my consultant .
she then left us to help attend _num_ other girls in the dressing rooms .
they are cheap office chairs and the dressing rooms and mirrors are dirty .
the consultant did not help me in or out of the dress .
i had no privacy and no help .
the place has almost no windows and is very dark with cheap lighting .
she never offered to order in any of the dresses i tried on .
there was no other option .
i was frustrated , embarrassed , upset , and disappointed .
i left azteca wanting to never put on a wedding dress again .
very disappointing .
worst customer service & experience .
the owners were rushing our girl to hurry up .
then she was complaining that she was hungry & her feet was tired .
but worse yet she was not assisting on putting on dresses for bridal party .
they never gave us a card to write down styles we liked .
i ca n't believe they would treat their customers like that .
terrible customer service .
i do n't know how anyone would go and spend money there .
cheap prices for cheap service .
i 'd rather pay double the price elsewhere .
all i can say was she was african american .
so we wait .
no kidding .
amazingly disappointing .
horrible experience for a 1st time bride !
horrible experience !
ended up at luv bridal where i was treated right and listened to .
they would not have me down for appointments i made .
and all style sizes available were _num_ and lower .
we seriously wasted our time here .
the staff have no idea what they 're doing .
first off , the parking situation is ridiculous .
i am not even sure why i ate my dinner .
it was a mix of ingredients that just did n't work .
we had carne asada tacos and there was almost no flavor at all .
this was not great .
not even good .
the meat is very hard .
twenty minutes for _num_ tacos ?
haha yeah should 've gone to the taco truck across the street .
the security guard at night called me a racist name .
avoid this motel at all possible cost .
as long as i do n't pay extra and i can park my car .
no luck .
i tried to lock my car .
i let them know what happened , but no on responded to my complaints .
i am appalled by the lack of respect for the customer .
i will not recommend this place .
the garlic toast was not really garlic toast .
very disappointing .
the mashed potatoes were even worse .
_num_ stars .
i 've already mentioned the terrible side dishes .
with a drink , that would have been $ _num_ .
for low quality food , those prices are unacceptable .
i guess people in arizona like this garbage .
potato salad not good at all .
beans not good at all .
ribs were really pink and when its pork i rather be safe than sorry .
food was the worst bbq ever , horrible , ribs were rare ?
yes pink stuck to the bone not done , threw them away .
expensive and horrible food .
i was not impressed with the sauce .
im use to sliced beef instead of shredded .
service is pretty slow and the pork sandwich i had was very greasy .
very dry .
ribs : now the ribs i can get behind .
however , i should n't have .
the meat was below average and did n't taste fresh .
the mashed potatoes were not good either .
i did not care for the bbq sauce .
i do not recommend this restaurant .
if you want good bbq , go to little miss bbq !
the ribs are crap .
the soda is watered down .
i have stopped by here on the way home several times .
this sandwich had exactly meat , cheese ( extra _num_ cents ) and bun .
no lettuce no tomato .
i did decline the mayo mustard and got a little bbq sauce .
not worth the time or money to pick it up at all .
it seems like the problems are always after _num_ .
tried the pulled pork sandwich , rib tips , and potato salad .
i ordered the chicken n ribs dinner .
i chose coleslaw and garlic toast .
overall experience was just ok .
the chicken was also ok .
i would n't go there again .
there was no bark to speak of on the brisket .
so disgusted by the female owner .
lady your everything wrong with america .
the `` cafe '' does n't serve coffee or tea .
what a silly joke if it were n't so sad !
the food was average at best and certainly overpriced for the quality .
there may have been one salad option , too .
this was a cool event to cater , but they all looked bored .
avoid !
it was strange , i had read a review with regards to budget today .
i was pissed off .
and that i should have declined it if i did n't want it .
my advice -- decline everything when renting a car from this company .
or renting a car in phoenix period .
but i guess that i learned my lesson to never rent from budget again .
no thanks , i just want what i paid for .
how about an suv - no thanks .
i never want to use budget there again .
firstly , getting to and from the facility is an ordeal .
after a four day rental my taxes and fees were roughly $ _num_ .
i do not know any other industry where this would be remotely acceptable .
if you can go to phoenix and not rent a car , do it .
it was about _num_ miles more .
check-in , however , was ridiculous .
walked past a lot of companies and they may have had ( maybe ? )
the worst experience i had for car rental ever .
he asked me if i want different car and my answer was no .
when i complained , they treated me like a liar .
i will never do business with someone who never honor their customers .
i do n't know who is the stupid guy .
maybe it was really me because i did business with them .
this is the last place i want to spend my afternoon while on vacation .
so disappointed .
is it possible to give zero stars ?
the washer fluid was out , so we could n't clean the windshield .
our flat tire light also went on midway through our trip .
is n't a cigarette lighter standard on , oh , every car ever ?
i would n't put my worst enemy through that .
never use budget .
never use budget .
better yet , buy and sell a used car while you 're in phoenix .
it would take less time than the shuttle and rental counter .
it does n't matter that you have a coupon .
just , no .
( but check reviews before renting from any of these ! )
budget should replace him immediately , or they will continue to loose more customers .
so i recently rented a car from my local hertz .
i could n't let this crappy place go on with my _num_ star review .
only gave it one star because i ca n't give them _num_ stars .
our number was _num_ .
ridiculous .
if that 's the case , then hire more agents to help your customers .
my company arranged this rental so i have no choice this time .
rude employees also !
unbelievable ... ... waited an hr for the bus from the terminal .
all these years of travel , first time renting a car .
nothing at this agency was clearly explained .
it was bad enough i do n't plan on using budget ever again .
shame on you budget !
remember , there are many car rental choices available .
i 'm giving budget one star already .
after reading bad reviews about other car companies i went with budget .
every other company i could have walked up and rented a car .
i didnt notice it on my bill either till i returned the car .
horrible waits , bad service .
every question i asked she lied about costing me an additional $ _num_ .
zero stars for this place .
to put another driver on the vehicle was more than twenty per day .
then i called from st louis where we landed .
all she needed to do was say that they looked at the video tape .
customer service lacks !
bad customer service !
rude and pushy !
too many other choices .
( sky harbor is already bad enough with the fees . )
i continued to tell him no and then he got rude .
we finished the paperwork and he handed me the paperwork without saying a word .
he did n't even tell me that they had found a more appropriate car .
i advised her that i had my personal insurance and declined theirs .
that is the same amount as my car note .
seems like budget rental cars does n't believe in human error .
budget sucks .
i just wasted _num_ bucks i could have spent elsewhere .
quite curt , if not rude , employees .
i wish i 'd checked yelp before i booked .
picked up the car got in line to exit and the nonsense continues .
unbelievable .
_num_ hours after arriving at phx .
the _num_ minute wait here to get a car is outrageous !
the other companies do n't look as bad as this one .
i wanted to like budget , i really did .
sorry , you lost me with this one .
horrible horrible company !
but not dirty enough to rack up _num_ $ of detailing fees !
believe me , there was no stains !
you know it do n't cost _num_ $ to detail a car !
dont go to budget ... that would be a huge mistake !
i recently rented a car while in the area for thanksgiving .
supposedly they looked for it and did n't find it anywhere .
yes it 's not there problem but it should have been handled better .
rented a car over thanksgiving .
returned without problem .
beware : the end of your rental is not the end .
they can not be trusted .
given ticket for _num_ min wait .
absolutely ridiculous must have over booked themselves .
avoid this company .
whatever , dude .
this is the worst bait and switch experience that we have ever had .
my number was _num_ and they were on _num_ .
do not rent from budget rent a car at this location .
they do n't even rate one star i my opinion .
we 've been struggling to get our money back for _num_ weeks .
according to my cc company , we could wait still another _num_ weeks .
i had a manager come out because he was so ridiculous .
my bill , instead of being $ _num_ , was $ _num_ .
worst customer service i have ever received .
this agency is a rip off !
their customer service reps on the phone were terrible as well .
never have experienced a car rental checking with a _num_ minute wait .
watch for fraud .
claimed no manager on site available to reverse but one would call me .
impossible to reach by phone .
very terrible experience with this company .
they were unprofessional and did not know how the process works .
this was by far the worst rental car experience of my life .
people with just reservations were screwed !
she was just horrendous .
save yourself the frustration and rent elsewhere !
the car sucks , their corporate phone system sucks .
customer service just hung up after i waited on hold for _num_ minutes .
terrible customer service and overpriced service .
Negative
full disclosure , i created this account to give this negative review .
a reservation apparently is not a real reservation here .
i would give zero stars if i could .
ridiculous service on a friday .
um , i 'm not sure , what 's that ?
they were on number _num_ .
ridiculously long line and wait at phoenix airport !
miserable cars .
budget employees created the problem , own it and correct it .
later i tried to call the customer service to have charges removed .
they refused .
so i was expecting a charge of about $ _num_ total .
do n't believe anything the desk clerk tells you or asks you .
frustrating experience .
do not recommend this location .
little did i know that the mini van was a super deluxe kia .
i have _num_ chances to budget .
we will not use this outfit again .
horrible service .
it 's off the charts ridiculous .
if you do n't like one , your not gon na like the other .
you even take the same bus to get to them all .
horrible !
the worst service i have ever seen !
seriously budget get your act together !
_num_ hours and counting !
surrounded by a room full of angry customers .
maybe get more people or do n't over sell during peak times .
worse car rental place .
happens every time i am here for spring training .
other people waiting , have costco car reservations also .
there are _num_ people in front of me .
waited _num_ hours for a car i had reserved in advance .
no discount offered for the inconvenience .
i was number _num_ and number _num_ was being served .
went to national and was helped in _num_ min .
worst experience i ever had at a car rental .
what a nightmare .
, there were still _num_ numbers ahead of me .
blame everyone but budget phoenix time and people management .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
this is ridiculous .
i think we will need to wait _num_ hours before we get our rental .
unacceptable .
horrible crooks !
customer service of no use after the fact .
they came out twice within a month to fix our pool .
but , if you are incompetent you can keep charging people and lie .
we put _num_ into minor parts and used it last night .
i selected swimming pool service and repair based on yelp reviews .
since the work , _num_ tiles have fallen off twice in _num_ years .
trying to get a new gate installed , along with an automated opener .
then they turn around and try to charge me for breaking the gate .
why set an appointment if you are n't going to keep it ?
warranty service- less than _num_ months after install my gate stops working .
well guess what no one showed .
what terrible service !
crap .
crap .
crap .
horrible layout .
crap .
crap .
crap .
that way i would put to good use this useless newspaper .
pretentious and condescending writing .
it 's time to stop playing high school newspaper .
some times the restaurant and movie reviews are n't painful .
otherwise , there is no worthwhile content in this paper .
to which he responded again with another insult .
what a waste of trees .
not rating new times specifically , but their friday food truck event .
the only reason phoenix new times is still around is because it 's free .
how it is a scam and that the owners id was stolen many times .
those books ... er , never mind ) .
time was , locals would look forward to thursdays to get a new times .
i also was expecting hushpuppies and grits for the price .
maybe , but i will only order the fish .
it 's too bad , because phoenix could use a good cheap seafood place .
my dad had fried okra and fried zucchini .
the cole slaw was pretty much like what you buy at the deli counter .
skip the chicken .
sorry , but we wo n't be back .
but this place is just awful .
the cocktail sauce is way too spicy and watery .
fried zucchini and mushrooms are alright , but nothing to terribly special .
the fish and shrimp are overpriced and way too heavily breaded .
and my brother in laws baked fish smelled just god awful .
wo n't be wasting my time or money at this dive again .
my advice , skip this place if you can !
_num_ .
any local chinese buffet will give you shrimp for a lot less than that .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the shrimp had too much batter .
_num_ .
this is not it folks .
do n't do this to yourself .
you 'll be better off .
there is no other explanation .
fish and chips was very bland .
it seemed fresh , just lacking .
the fries were disappointing too .
probably wo n't be back .
i 'm sorry , what ?
this place was the worst !
the food is horrible !
horrible !
$ _num_ for a bowl of bad canned clam chowder .
fries were soggy and bland .
clams were bland as well , i 've had frozen that were better .
cocktail sauce was even bland .
Neutral
where is the negative _num_ stars button ?
no taste buds ?
the last time i entered was was cuz purely by accident .
they owe me $ _num_ and _num_ mins of my life back !
and ppl thought pete 's was bad ?
ate here on a friday night with a friend .
the place was busy which is usually an okay sign .
i ordered the _num_ shrimp , _num_ fish and chips combo .
the fries could have been better .
to me it just came across as grumpy management .
these people where not very nice .
this place was horrible !
do n't waist you 're time or money .
go elsewhere for seafood .
they never smell fishy , though .
not impressed .
by far the worst crab legs i have ever had .
they came out dry and the meat was stiff .
worst fish and chips i 've ever had .
the fish was tough because it was over fried and the breading was sliding .
the chips ( french fries ) were cold and tough ... never again .
but at least it also looks like a dive from the inside too .
no real seasoning to the okra breading .
she did really like the fish though .
that was the slightly redeeming factor .
disgusting .
is half the size it used to be .
too bad i could not convince him how good the food is .
fish is too thick for batter .
very bland unless you call fryer oil an herb or spice .
went in for lunch on june 2nd .
both toilets full of crap .
did not look like the sullivan family to me .
part _num_ : customer service was awful .
it took me about _num_ min to place my order .
the woman behind the counter must of been having a bad day .
so she starts to push buttons and has a little attitude about it .
do i recommend no .
this was not my experience today , july _num_ , _num_ .
it was a bunch of the most random junk .
my wife was so bummed , and it ruined our whole shopping experience .
only good on fridays .
it 's only half the size it used to be .
( should have been a red flag ) .
he said , he would have the installation people give me a call .
did a great job and could n't be happier .
in _num_ , they did it again to our home in goodyear .
these people strike me as extremely lazy !
they did very lousy work , poor craftsmanship .
this was slightly better , but not by far .
to boot , the item looked really crappy .
looked like it had never been cleaned .
i 'm not holding my breathe !
i 'm pretty sure they lost it .
save your money and stay away from this place !
their customer service is terrible , they are rude and never on time .
the work is shoddy at best .
horrible horrible horrible company .
they do not give a flying f about their customers .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
i can not say enough bad things about this place .
horrible company , horrible customer service ... .
i would n't use this company to shine a new nickel for me !
it can get crowded , but hey , it 's an airport .
otherwise , if you must travel through this airport , take america west .
the terminal sucks .
they did remodel but it is just as bad as before .
there 's just one big bus to hop onto .
somehow , my bag and i did not end up on the same flight .
they found it within _num_ hours of me getting home .
ok , end rant .
i hate taking buses between terminals .
i hate it .
and why was that girl at the security check point such a miserable bitch ?
i do n't really want to be here either .
when i travel , i tend to have things .
yeah , i 'm totally ready to hop on a plane now .
- there are no atm machines once you get past security .
the lines are way too long , the workers are way too cranky .
yeah , this place is hell alright .
only americans would know that .
beats the los angeles airport or taking greyhound just barely , tho .
it was almost easier to just drive there from san diego than to fly .
i wish you could still meet people at the gates without a ticket .
sky harbor is like any other airport .
one time i was picking someone up - had them on the cell phone .
i wish i had run him over .
if i die , i die .
where this terminal is the best is in the choice of food and drinks .
this is where terminal _num_ shines .
the flip side is that there is one bar and it is lame .
not much to see here , really .
i only spent time in terminal _num_ as that 's where delta is .
overall if i had another choice i 'd probably not go through phoenix .
as far as gluten-free eating , this airport is terrible !
boo to this airport and its eating choices , boo !
i dread each trip i have to take to this place .
then they lost interest with me .
and the shuttles are not as frequent as they could be .
ok , let 's try to kill two hours layover on phx .
it is dull and boring .
choice of _num_ sandwiches - exactly the same in every single one .
i do fly frequently and i am not really a fan of phx .
after that , it 's downhill .
it is n't rocket science .
for me the major issues are driving through the airport .
the terminals are not user friendly .
almost as bad as oakland .
people are freaking rude .
it is not the friendliest airport anywhere - unless you compare it to oakland .
plus 's - free wifi , no arms on seats .
bus service between terminals slow .
every time i have flown in there have been long lines for the bus .
after cleaning security there is only _num_ sandwich shop and _num_ crappy little bar .
the gates themselves are old and run down .
the food is pretty bad and is all shut down by 9pm .
what really scared me were the birds in the southwest terminal .
disgusting and dirty .
on the upside , i 'll guess weather is n't a factor here .
and the north curb and south curb ?
the whole place , inside and out , appears to be very cluttered .
i think it is because the service is not really good .
also , the security is slow .
i 'm not done !
we barely made our flight after they called last call .
had a layover here ... _num_ hours !
did not enjoy it .
bathroom floors are sooo sticky and dirty .
when you book a flight advice is to avoid this airport !
being stuck in terminal _num_ is an awful experience .
no big deal .
does n't seem like a big deal ?
they 're _num_ miles apart .
okay , not really .
not sure what else they can do to make things better .
most of the problems are caused by the layout .
c concourse has no internet signal .
no waiting .
old , smells , and not enough signs .
not a fan .
not a huge deal , right ?
wrong !
lame !
will avoid this as a connecting airport as much as possible !
zero signs that tell you where to go .
thats fucking pathetic and sad .
the walk is only about _num_ yards .
except that you have to exit security , and walk outside to get there .
do not order food in this place .
the restaurant selections are limited .
!
i 've never flown out of sky harbor .
so why only two stars ?
the driving around to find where to park is horrible .
they need to remember that most people do n't frequent the airport .
the waits for baggage are unacceptable .
better plan on a long wait there too .
my worst time was _num_ mins .
not so much a fan of this airport .
the furniture and dcor need some serious updating .
what outlets we could find were dead , too .
thats it in my terminal worth mentioning .
bathroom doors do n't lock .
hate getting stuck here when i need to eat .
not the worst airport and not the best .
so not true .
signage : poor to non existent .
if it 's there , it 's not placed well .
years and years of poor planning .
leave lots of time if you are using a rental car !
i have never been to a more ridiculous airport .
i will avoid flying here in the future .
whether i 'm on time , late or early .
having all the food outside of said security = extremely inconvenient .
sky harbor , you lose .
do not collect $ _num_ .
no cookie for you .
poor service and so so food .
the food sucks .
parking is a nightmare .
what a nightmare .
especially when you have to reach terminal _num_ .
beware : terminal _num_ has no clearly marked signs for passenger drop off .
the signs to get back on the _num_ are n't very clear either .
obviously , i do n't enjoy coming here .
plus , i have no other choice .
unless i buy my own jet .
even then i will probably still have to deal with the crazy taxi drivers .
atmosphere : clean facilities but nothing spectacular .
- car rental return lanes through the airport is confusing .
return factor - _num_ % , but not by choice .
phoenix , phoenix , phoenix .
you sure worked hard to make me dislike you .
but flying out of phoenix .
every person in phoenix apparently did n't know that there was a liquid rule .
and tsa , of course , was not being nice about it .
`` no sir .
phoenix sky harbor ranks as the worst airport of all time .
it turned out he gave me the wrong directions .
he also tells me i am going to miss my flight .
meanwhile , i 'm standing outside thinking `` what the heck ! ''
as if they could n't see i was out of breath .
sky harbor needs a closed airport layout .
you should never have to leave and go outside to a connecting flight !
denver ) they need workers out in the terminal gates assisting travelers .
never again sky harbor !
the airport needs some good upgrading in the near future .
terminal _num_ is possibly the slowest security i have ever been through , anywhere .
nothing special to get excited about .
and then , they managed to lose our luggage .
so , in all , sky harbor , you disappoint me !
renting a car here is ridiculous .
i 'm not joking .
add another 15-20 minutes to that _num_ hour lead time , folks .
really , the only redeeming quality of this garbage airport is the free wi-fi .
this gave me plenty of time to wander around phoenix sky harbor .
worst international airport in the united states .
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
ridiculous .
worst airport in america for efficiency .
( it is set up like a giant u .
in short , this airport stinks .
a mandatory walk across the airport is not good .
that carpet will not let you roll yours easily .
why is it the worst you ask ?
other airports have no problem keeping their shuttles in the move .
not a huge airport , the food options are regular old airport food options .
nothing special or awesome but no real complaints .
there is nothing simple about this airport .
and they do n't care how short a window is for your connection .
employees are not helpful .
i hate this airport .
i wouldnt want my worst enemy going in there .
horrible .
poor service , long check-in process and time ... total hassle .
will never , ever rent from them again .
in order to get from terminal to terminal , you need to walk .
they do have moving walkways , but people refuse to walk on them .
i hate these people .
so i do n't like it here .
food , drink , and amenities at this airport are seriously lacking .
stay away from eating in the sports bars in this airport .
- there is absolutely no good food options .
- everything is just so plain and boring .
the walls are a nasty sandy color .
the carpets have no life in them , and neither do the employees .
- toilets are complete crap .
that 's just disgusting .
baggage check police when called up takes minutes to show up .
police guys did n't show up for _num_ minutes .
there was also another _num_ minutes wait for another passenger god knows why .
you know - i made my plane but the services here are lame .
a crappy eatery here and there .
another tsa agent directed me where to go .
yeah , i could n't believe it either .
needless to say with all that , i missed my flight .
the food is meh , the terminal layout is meh .
it 's easy to get to from downtown and scottsdale which is a plus .
the rental car facility requires a bus transfer but it 's pretty quick .
in general sky harbor is lacking in almost every way .
bravo to them ... it is the only decent place in sky harbor .
do n't fly through phoenix .
bad , bad experience .
there simply is n't much that is exciting to eat or buy here .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ where are the seats ?
i do n't mind the airport itself but the wait for baggage is ridiculous .
_num_ minute flight home from vegas and 30+ minute wait on baggage .
to hell with this airport and really , to hell with arizona .
no more , those days are long behind me .
and please tell me why the hell i 'm paying for your football stadium .
travel between terminals requires a shuttle bus , and they 're somewhat slow .
all told , phx is neither bad nor impressive .
i hate this airport more than i could ever tell you .
the restrooms are ok but usually crowded .
the most frustrating part of this airport is the baggage claim process .
numerous times i have waited close to _num_ to _num_ minutes for my baggage .
over the years i thought this would improve but it has n't .
first off , the seating area for continental airlines is really small .
even worse , there were other people standing around until it was available .
overall , the feel of the airport was outdated and definitely needed more outlets !
adding wi-fi , some better restaurants , etc .
it is the outside of the airport that is a big problem .
picking up and dropping off people is a nightmare .
it is insanely frustrating .
they really should have some sort of terminal connect train .
the layout of terminal _num_ is frustrating .
the whole airports needs an overhaul .
my experience here is not one that has a lot to cover .
very confusing airport .
for an international airport , i would have expected a more luxury feel .
services offered while waiting for your next flight ?
do n't do it if the gate is packed .
this airport does not have many amenities , especially in terminal _num_ .
hands down , it is the worst airport i have ever been to .
luckily i know the airport well but its just a terrible system .
one star because zero is n't an option .
then there 's the restrooms .
gross .
they only had _num_ of _num_ lines running the day i was there .
there were good food options in the terminal , but not at the gate .
in the terminal _num_ section of southwest , there was a bar and grill .
the food was expensive , and the menu very limited .
the terminals feel drab and dingy .
seriously though , entering this airport feels like taking a step back in time .
that 's what sky harbor feels like .
speaking of food , the restaurant selection here is abysmal .
i could n't believe my eyes , it is not _num_ ?
this airport really sucks .
the layout for one is ridiculous .
also they have a complete lack of power outlets !
phx is truly one of the worst airports out there .
it just does n't get much worse than this airport .
_num_ degrees .
standing outside in the heat waiting for a bus .
we have a packed bus and the driver is just standing outside .
even oakland upgraded ... get with it phoenix !
this has to be one of the worst airports ever !
i expected more from phoenix ( i do n't know why ) .
not impressed .
this caused so much hassle because i didnt expect they demand such a thing .
yup , just about what i expected from phoenix .
it was just ridiculous .
but here it was even worse .
i flew into the phoenix airport on a southwest flight .
all of the information boards only provided flight information for that terminal .
he told me i 'd have to take a shuttle to another terminal .
dumb .
even the club closes relatively early .
did i mention that the four terminals are not connected in any way ?
it 's the worst in the usa and maybe the world .
most confusing airport ever !
just very poor signage .
not a horrible place , but certainly not good .
this i can not understand .
either requires a bus trip .
that is a big pet peeve of mine .
that is enough reason not to fly here .
this is _num_ .
old , ugly , worn out , and dirty .
there was one charging station that i saw , but it did n't work .
pathetic .
there are no words for how bad this place is .
the food sucks .
it feels like it was designed by some kids on a beach somewhere .
driving into phoenix would be much better .
this time it was on the southwest side !
unimpressed .
in addition , there are not that many food options passed security .
the airport is also confusing .
there is no efficient way to navigate between major terminals .
it 's obnoxious .
annoying .
if i could give _num_ stars i would but i cant .
worst customer service experience ive ever had .
when i get there _num_ people are in line .
over the next hour i cant believe what takes place .
worst service ever i will plan on driving in the future .
i land in terminal c and have to get to terminal d .
_num_ ) get to gate as they 're closing the gate .
prints my new ticket and tells me it 's in _num_ hours .
_num_ ) change the gate on my new ticket again ... twice !
_num_ ) got on next flight and left .
my recent experience at phoenix was n't the greatest .
i do n't like this airport very much in particular the us airways terminals .
they need updating , more power outlets , renovated bathrooms , etc .
terminal b is just horrendous .
i hate this airport , friendliest my ass !
horribly designed airport .
i try to go through denver instead , but not always possible .
its spread out pretty far and wide ( lots of walking ) .
on-site rentals would be nice , but not here .
i 've never been a fan of phoenix 's sky harbor .
bad airport .
not friendly at all .
lack of power outlets .
it is modern but no good taste , terminal two is to cry for .
i mean whoever designed this had not sense of art whatsoever .
my boyfriend and i recently had a layover here .
dave goes to new mexico part _num_ .
there was no place to buy sunglasses inside security .
worst airport ever .
not cool especially when you are traveling with a grandmother who needs wheelchair assistance .
i hope i never had a layover here again .
avoid if at all possible .
just an unpleasant experience every time i have to fly through here .
sorry , phx .
hopefully we will not cross paths again .
i 'm just not a fan of this place .
i do not like to wait in line .
i do not like the extra fees .
i do not like the extreme crowds .
the wait to pay is oh so slow .
i do not like this traffic jam .
no checked bags .
went straight to security and barely made my flight .
the line was not even that long when i got to security .
the absolute worst when you 're trying to get home .
people hate smokers .
we know you hate us but we do n't really care .
now i 'm cranky and hungry , but everything is too expensive here .
ca n't wait to leave !
i 've never gone through security here before .
-they did n't check my id as i went into the line for tsa .
they only looked at my boarding pass .
but the alternative is to risk watching someone leave a bag behind .
somehow that is not comforting to me .
there 's no way of knowing you really checked everyone at this point .
it 's just weird .
the airport itself also was n't an interesting site .
just an airport like lax .
do n't even want to give one star .
shocking , really .
one of my least favorite airports .
the rental car building is a long bus ride away .
it seems like forever to get to the gate .
this airport is bad .
i must have walked over a mile to find everything closed .
even if things were open , there are very few choices for decent food .
home of some of my biggest airport nightmares of all time .
ugh .
i just hate this place .
meh , it 's functional i guess .
i 'm not really a fan of this air port for one reason only .
seriously they were super rude to me !
my favorite thing about this airport is that you can not get lost .
so when i left hawaii everything was cool .
it was super easy and not a big deal .
haha so sad for the works , they looked pretty stressed .
flew out of terminal _num_ this morning and did n't have a great experience .
and there was nothing inside the terminal .
terrible airline operations , incompetent tsa .
if anything , _num_ for free wifi that 's actually pretty fast .
the signage at the airport was poor if you do a cross terminal .
the signage at the airport was poor if you do a cross terminal .
things like dining options , free wifi , charging outlets and seating areas .
all things that this airport lacks .
ugh .
try to avoid this place if you can .
the employees here are extremely rude !
awful place to have a layover .
i travel quite often and this airport was not very impressive .
horrible experience .
it 's such a disgusting feeling seeing how my tax dollars work !
avoid this airport or terminal if possible .
also , there are _num_ wings per terminal which is quite confusing .
one of the b terminal wings does n't have a restaurant with a bar .
why does it smell like that ?
terminal _num_ is absolutely the worst terminal ever .
and there are no places to eat pre security .
dont fly out of this terminal .
there 's no getting around it .
amazing !
its poorly lit and feels `` sweaty . ''
if i could give my experience at this airport a zero i would .
us airways customer service is terrible !
the rep was rude and a little snotty .
probably the worst airport in terms of signage in the us .
once you exit the airport there are no signs to find a taxi .
the gates layout sucks and you ca n't tell who is coming or going .
it is hot and there are very limited charging stations .
all in all not a fan for this sometimes necessary evil airport .
this airport is a bitch to get around walking or driving .
everything is marked and the layout is horrible .
the food court is pretty gross , still .
from here , none if my flights have ever left on time .
are you kidding me , someone just wanted to go drinking that night .
no one could believe it .
that ended up being a _num_ foot by _num_ foot safe .
unacceptable and completely ridiculous .
glad they have an information desk .
i hate this airport !
i hate this airport .
this airport is garbage on so many levels .
you can show up here _num_ hours early and miss your flight .
not just you , like your whole plane full .
seriously , many phx folks drive to tucson .
it has become the airlines that cater to dogs better than they do people .
i have severe allergies to pets .
not so much .
it 's too bad , because this used to be a pretty nice airport .
shame on you , phoenix !
i 've been to better county airports .
every time i come here it 's another experience to forget .
_num_ .
_num_ , than _num_ , than back to one .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
not a fan of this airport for one reason .
there are very few ways to charge anything .
lots of chairs but no outlets .
not sure how such a busy airport can have such few options .
first , it 's been remodeled .
i really could have used a starbucks .
this airport is horrible .
fail .
fail .
fail .
worst airport design .
will definitely try to avoid flying thru here as much as i can .
not a fan of this airport .
sorry , phx , not looking forward to our next meeting .
avoid this place unless you are flying , in which case it is fine .
ugh .
not a great airport .
we ate breakfast and then headed back to the gate at _num_ .
there was no way we could have known that they bumped up the time .
would n't necessarily recommend .
the seats are not upgraded in the terminal like many other airports .
the people in the terminal are kind and just step over , etc .
i 'm not a fan of this one !
nothing special .
tsa checks were not the best .
the lines were slow .
sunday afternoon and they only had _num_ check points open in terminal four .
hotel was only ten minutes away .
old airport and really confusing to get around in it or around it .
there are _num_ terminals - and they are all in need of a renovation .
lack of charging stations is a definite bummer .
it 's just an old dingy , sticky airport .
it just needs some tlc to bring it back .
the d terminal is only one arm .
there was n't a whole lot of time to begin with .
horrible .
the hidden taxes and fees are ridiculous .
they try to con you into buying their total insurance package .
will not be renting from them again .
my least favorite airport when flying east .
i just hate how hard it is to get to the different terminals .
worst airport for baggage claim .
not a great airport .
i try to avoid this airport when possible .
what a piece of crap air port !
one vending machine that just had drinks , no snacks .
additionally , the rental car facility is a long way from the airport .
the biggest problem that i have with sky harbor is the layout .
hopefully , you wo n't have to walk too far .
this airport is absolutely ridiculous !
if this is your first time be prepared for a nightmare .
if you can help it , avoid this airport at all costs !
perhaps the worst airport in north america .
services are very limited and there is no accommodations for smokers once past security .
the tsa people were terribly inefficient and somewhat rude .
extremely disorganized lines at check-in ( us airways ) and tsa .
all very hospitable folk , no doubt .
i never thought of that ! '' )
and annoying .
one of the worst major airports .
tsa is set up in hallways .
you ca n't get from terminal to terminal .
horrible .
bathrooms way too small always a line , and dirty !
not enough seating in terminal area .
the mexican resturant had a line out the door , _num_ deep .
really bad airport .
one of the worst major airports .
tsa is set up in hallways .
you ca n't get from terminal to terminal .
horrible .
bathrooms way too small always a line , and dirty !
not enough seating in terminal area .
the mexican resturant had a line out the door , _num_ deep .
the gates are too far a part if you are cutting it close .
it is too bad really .
i will avoid flying through this airport from now on .
to make matters worse the moving walkways are often out of commission .
also , the mens restrooms were poorly designed .
_num_ % of the flights we travel through sky harbor are delayed .
we will try to avoid phoenix in our future travels .
i am so disappointed in this airport .
who makes gates where seating is limited to half the people on the plane .
worse layover yet .
do n't check bags to this airport .
you pay _num_ bucks to wait .
for such a small airport this place is very inefficient .
baggage is really slow and the screen to check the baggage carousel is broken .
security check point is also slow .
i only gave it one star because i had too .
this is the worst airport .
i travel frequently and never has a flight left on time .
the air conditioner is not on .
on my way back to my terminal , the moving sidewalk was shut down .
by this point i 'm drenched in sweat and need a drink .
this airport is terrible .
the train only goes in the wrong direction i wanted to go in .
so , no choice but to walk .
not like it does n't get really hot in phoenix .
not enough outlets !
i wish i had caught his name .
he was a miserable person with no people skills .
ugh .
my least favorite airport .
terminal _num_ is by far the least comfortable .
i dread entering phx .
worst airport i have even been to .
its not that hard .
if you have any other options , do n't fly into this airport .
the worst customer service i have ever seen .
because for the 2nd time , they do n't have a plane .
never again southwest .
they do n't have adequate signage and traffic is usually a mess .
well that 's just too bad !
from there we went to the air terminal store to pick up some items .
the rental car service center is horrible for terminal _num_ .
of course this was too late to catch my flight so thanks for that .
when arriving at the airport last week , check in was simple and quick .
she was rude , short with her answers and not very helpful .
so following _num_ sets of requests at the same time is a little difficult .
_num_ mins .
later , and now _num_ mins .
after my shuttle was scheduled to arrive , i was still there .
so while standing outside the door and rather upset at this point .
so overall my experience fell short due to the staff more than anything else .
this airport sucks .
there must be _num_ people just in this wing alone .
not many shops or restaurants to choose from to kill time before your flight .
not impressive but enough for a small child to be excited .
horribly designed airport ; terminals are all spread out .
worst airport experience ever .
first , there are very few premium amenities at phx .
sky harbor rates low with this seasoned traveler .
then there 's the poor selection of beer , four peaks ?
not a fan of the choices sky harbor thinks acceptable .
the _num_ stars are for terminal _num_ only .
terminal _num_ is a totally different story .
but you ca n't get on .
why ca n't wifi be easier at us airports .
frankly - one of the worst airports in america .
horribly outdated .
terrible transportation between terminals .
useless wifi .
not enough restrooms or restaurants .
if i could avoid it i would .
they need to upgrade and build areas where you can charge your phone .
not acceptable .
the tsa staffing in security is absolutely the worst i have dealt with .
quite possibly this is the worst in the country .
so few options in terminal _num_ for dining or killing time .
sky harbor ... a pathetic excuse for a traveler friendly airport .
i know that no one really likes going to the airport now a days .
however this airport certainly does not make that experience any better .
bathrooms at this airport are few and far between .
crowded , busy , and uncomfortable .
every eatery has a line and no where to sit .
there could be better food choices .
however , the phoenix sky harbor tsa agents need better training .
until i flew out of phoenix sky harbor .
all the good restaurants are outside of security ... which is very inconvenient .
not my favorite airport .
phoenix sky harbor airport is the absolute worst as far as internet connection .
ca n't wait to see sky harbor during high tourist season .
there 's not an outlet to be found anywhere .
no free wifi either .
big low score for tsa .
returning a rental car is the worst .
_num_ hour _num_ min to get from one gate to another .
having to go back through tsa on a simple transfer is terrible .
unbelievably inept tsa staff !
they deserve a minus star rating .
thanks phoenix airport for the long wait at the tsa check in .
due to the long wait we missed our flight !
omg , this is one the worse airport .
airport itself is very old old old .
now , tsa lines were closed due to lack of staff !
it 's _num_ pm at night !
horrible airport !
the folks who are in the terminal or not very friendly nor very helpful .
not very excited about coming back here .
tsa at terminal c here was ridiculously bad .
i have a special need ... to not miss my flight !
pretty pathetic flying out of here .
terminal _num_ security grossly understaffed .
1/2 hour to get through is ridiculous .
open _num_ hours , ha !
but seriously , when there 's nothing even open ?
should i eat my money ?
i have to fly american airlines through this outdated airport today .
checking your bags through tsa again for a connecting flight is absolutely ridiculous .
there is nothing modern , comfortable , or clean about terminal _num_ .
this airport is the pits .
this place had _num_ , one security line during the thanksgiving weekend .
the employees here are n't very friendly either .
outlets are also limited at the gates , so plan accordingly .
one hour wait through security .
someone is not doing their job !
just try not to ever rent a car here !
worst i 've seen in the country .
just awful we 're expected to stand and wait .
if you are flying american airlines , avoid this airport at all costs .
they pull this ridiculous `` you bag is too big sir '' crap .
long security lines , poor food choices , and dirty bathrooms .
no thank you phx .
yesterday at the phoenix airport was the worst .
there were only four lines open for hundreds of people .
it was a really stressful way to end a great vacation in arizona .
if so , terminal _num_ did not get the message .
this place is run down and needs a makeover like nobody 's business .
do n't expect any great eateries .
no one working and things moving real slow .
probably _num_ different airports .
this is by far the worst .
lax , my least favorite would get a _num_ star rating compared to this .
shut this airport and build one somewhere else .
so confusing .
it was a nightmare .
i do n't have problems with following directions signs or instructions .
inside , was worse .
it was worse than the worst disneyland line .
worst airport in the world in my humble opinion .
i hate this airport , and the rental car center is the reason .
this is the slowest car rental set-up i 've seen in the usa .
too much visiting among the tsa staff to take care of the travelers .
just terrible .
meanwhile , most of security check stations are empty and waiting for passengers .
Neutral
only negative is the security .
it was ridiculously understaffed and took nearly two hours .
the seats are so uncomfortable and impossible to sleep in .
this is maybe the most uncomfortable i 've been in my entire life .
least impressive to me was the food selection .
lack of options makes for one cranky traveler .
on the plus side , i did breeze through check in and security .
i put this airport as one of my least favorite large city airports .
rental car facilities are far from the airport and hotel shuttle service is spotty .
meh , i do n't love this airport .
one of the very worst security areas in the country .
the worst airport i 've been to in a long time .
every tsa agent here should be fired .
rental bus drivers worst in the nation .
what a first impression when u leave the already pathetic airport .
tsa lines here are ridiculous .
)
Neutral
obviously their tests ended up being negative and i barely made my flight .
very poor wifi .
nothing impressive at all .
smells bad , constant construction that seems to never get fixed .
she was standing in the same spot 10-15 yards away .
horrible , horrible , horrible experience .
everything was under construction and signs were very bad .
wrong , wrong wrong .
i get stuck here , every , single , time .
not even a tissue ! ''
hard job , always on the defensive , but we 're humans .
there is nowhere to sit at the gate but the floor .
i get anxiety just thinking about it .
_num_ arrival for _num_ gal of jet a and a quick turn .
the dog volunteers and front desk were so friendly .
none of my calls were returned .
do not support this organization !
they do n't have animals ' best interest in mind .
what a disgusting and uncaring organization !
so much for him being `` hard to adopt '' huh ?
so , she was given a sick kitten !
that is not allowed .
such a shame .
we adopted a dog from this facility in the beginning of december .
we are both annoyed , frustrated , and feel that this was personal .
very disappointed with our experience with this shelter .
i will not be back solely because of how rude they were !
totally shady operation .
it 's only _num_ bucks or something like that .
but really , it does n't matter if it 's _num_ or _num_ dollars .
very easy to miss .
still a _num_ % shady company , still stand by my review _num_ % .
the shuttle are fairly frequent and prices reasonable .
what has really rubbed me the wrong way is the service .
no apology to me for his behavior .
i could n't believe it .
i 'm very unsatisfied .
this place is below par .
literally - falling down in places .
cheap but that 's it .
- the driver who picked us up was absolutely awful .
the car was there for less than _num_ hours .
this `` fuel and service charge '' is ridiculous .
the coupon says $ _num_ per day .
said nothing about additional fees may apply .
stupid me for not reading prior reviews before going to this place .
but , i 'll get to that in a minute .
not even close in fact .
so ... actually ... in my book ... not ... free .
ridiculous .
we had to wait forever to be picked up on our return trip .
worst experience ever !
service : provided incorrect pick up location info for our return trip .
management was not accomodating or apologetic at all for wasting our time .
this is no longer my spot .
i guess i 'd rather pay a little bit more for peace of mind .
it 's a little further away but looks way nicer and more secure .
the service has gotten absolutely terrible .
every other parking facilities shuttle has been by 2-3 times .
this mornings experience was horrible .
so , i did so and the machine said out of order .
horrible service !
never returning back to this dump !
we booked a covered parking spot online and printed our reservation .
the way back to the car was a disaster .
the first shuttle driver was the only saving grace here .
the worst run airport parking service i have ever used .
the driver actually told me i should get a cab .
pay the little extra and get better service .
who would n't make a reservation for the busy thanksgiving weekend .
tried this parking company one time and will never do it again !
the parking lot is run down and disgusting .
when we came back , we waited over _num_ minutes for a van .
we will not use this one again .
beware of letting drivers handle your luggage for you .
they always insist , trying for bigger tip , which i understand .
hawaii trip was less enjoyable due to the hassle and extra expense .
my bags are `` my responsibility . ''
then they should n't let the drivers handle the bags .
terrible customer support .
i will never use them again , too many other choices .
had to wait for 3rd shuttle first _num_ full already !
i have used this service several times .
tool _num_ minutes to get picked up at _num_ .
there has never been horse racing at the greyhound park .
they have n't had dog races there for years either .
unfortunately ( ? )
basically felt like i was wasting his time asking for help .
horrible .
just horrible .
so not worth it .
wow , what a horrible experience .
a horrible night of sleep .
it was not _num_ minutes , that 's for sure .
anyway , that 's another review .
horrible service !
did not offer anything to remedy the situation , nor when asked to .
the staff behind the counter were polite , but just so .
damned inconvenient since my room was at the far end away from the office .
the most bland prime i 've ever had .
ordered prime rib and after it twice came cold they attempted to charge me .
no water , no bread , pathetic service .
overall horrible experience .
i left an _num_ % tip .
this should never happen at any high end restaurant .
writing this review breaks my heart .
i tried it again several months later - same thing .
if not , go to morton 's for the money .
maybe it was the option i chose but i was n't very impressed .
he said he was hungry but apparently did n't like the flavor .
i just was n't impressed .
apparently restaurant week offended our waiter ?
( extra $ _num_ , really ? )
the salad was average , nothing to write home about .
even the horseradish , which my husband loves , did n't help .
for dessert , i ordered the chocolate mousse and my husband ordered the cheesecake .
my husband had to flag him down and request our bill .
my girlfriend and i ate here in _num_ .
i caution you to eat here , they may make you sick .
they do n't care about their customers , suggest try another steak place .
it 's totally not .
cow rug , leather , old cowboy photos on the wall .
i ordered a half slab of ribs with garlic potatoes and a salad .
it was literally just shredded up dry cabbage !
so ... yeah , did n't eat the slaw .
i would n't do dinner again .
got there about 5:30 left at 7:00 .
very slow service .
the _num_ oz .
ribeye was good , but not worth $ _num_ , i 've had better .
we wo n't be back , too many good restaurants in phoenix .
sad salad .
avoid this place .
remembering last years visit we were disappointed .
cut into this one and again barely warm .
they knocked off an iced tea and one alcoholic drink .
simply stated , i 'll never return .
there , i guess that 's as good a start as any .
the bread basket contained biscuits and jalapeno corn bread .
frozen seafood and sauce out of a jar for _num_ bucks .
can you understand why i 'm pissed off ?
on its own , it did n't have much flavor .
my first visit to this steakhouse was a company lunch .
had the worse experience at this rest .
our server was rude and arrogant .
the worse service i have ever experienced .
filet med with a little pink in the middle .
i said no it is not .
did not even offer me another filet .
i ca n't believe that she did not comp .
our party of _num_ went elsewhere .
hard to below they could not use the extra business .
it 's terribly loud and hard to hold a conversation in .
not horrible but would never recommend or return .
do n't waste your time !
the steaks are n't hot .
the veggies are n't fresh .
i ordered the _num_ oz filet and he ordered the _num_ oz prime rib .
there were no rolls , salad or anything else to accompany the lunch .
do n't think i 'll go back for another _num_ years .
yikes , bad call .
it was just ok .
however , i would suggest spending the extra and having a far superior meal .
the place was just average but at top prices .
i will not be back .
horrible horrible horrible !
and zero stars for service !
so disappointed in our service i ca n't even tell you .
food forgotten .
we left ten percent on a $ _num_ bill .
otherwise i think your money is better spent elsewhere .
went to dinner with _num_ other people and we left disappointed .
sides also were unimpressive .
right off the bat , our waiter seemed to be annoyed with us .
i ordered a ny strip steak which was pretty flavorless .
two of our four steaks were grossly overcooked and had to be sent back .
when the bill arrived there was no discount to the total for their errors .
she did not finish the liver .
horrible service !
worst service i 've ever received !
never coming back and telling everyone i know about the terrible service here .
extremely rude !
no flavor .
there was no char or flavor to the steak .
buffalo meatloaf : no texture , bad flavor .
it 's extremely mushy .
potato stack : these are n't bad .
a little mushy , but not bad .
however , their bacon is like dust .
poor customer service skills when i asked them to refund my $ _num_ .
designated spot is actually between doors & and _num_ causing unnecessary confusion .
i called and they will not honor their online pricing .
trying to book _num_ days of parking .
very poor business practice .
i 'm rating only their parking service .
their online price has gone up by _num_ % and their service has declined .
long story short , the lawn will never be the same .
the leaves were not completely picked up either .
additionally , they were only in my yard for _num_ min .
well that was _num_ days ago .
guess not .
now it 's _num_ and we have n't even made it out of phx .
this is junk !
called and got an answering machine .
i will never use this shuttle .
lousy information , lousy communication , lousy customer service .
would not recommend .
why ca n't you have a sign ?
disappointed they have stopped providing water .
avoid !
some were attractive .
simply a waste of time , and money .
i do n't recommend at all .
it was n't bad it just was nothing special .
it has been around forever , the waitress was efficient but no smiles .
the decor is very _num_ 's and never updated .
the lighting on the restaurant side is poor , so they lose points there .
the menus have been dirty on occasion .
i 'm not a fan of handling a dirty menu right before i eat .
_num_ out of _num_ stars .
actually , it 's kind of bland .
given the cost , this food 's really not worth it .
the burgers are about $ _num_ to $ _num_ a pop .
again , very poor value .
lastly , never get the coleslaw .
_num_ out of _num_ stars .
$ - _num_ star out of _num_ .
if you 're going during happy hour , however , then it is .
during unhappy hours , your money will be better spent elsewhere .
spend your money elsewhere .
i do n't know , that 's why i 'm asking .
i almost just got cold stone for breakfast .
a nice green chili burrito sounded just right for 9am .
$ _num_ after tax , that 's what i got .
only saving grace was that the side of salsa was very spicy .
the burrito was surprisingly small .
it was not that tasty , and it was real watery or wet .
after every bite .
i hate to admit it , but it made me crave for chipotle !
one of the worst airport meals i 've ever had .
the beef in the burrito tasted like school cafeteria stew .
thinking about airport food in phoenix ... never again in front of security !
like most airport restaurants , it looks clean .
the menu , while varied , did not allow much for an innovative order .
my hispanic food passion of late is a guacamole burrito .
it 's guacamole , onion , cheese , sour cream and bacon .
edible , but nothing to write home about .
beats burger king any day .
_num_ minutes and $ _num_ later , i felt gross .
it 's almost impossible to ruin that ... almost .
i am still sick to my stomach .
they never apologized and never offered for any help .
worst customer service ever .
wrong .
i was told well there is more room thats why we charge extra .
i 've had a number of very poor customer service experiences with alaska .
wrong .
customer service was incredibly rude and unhelpful .
the customer service at sky harbor airport is poor .
i get the jumbo jack with cheese and i like the egg rolls .
last time through the drive thru i asked for ketchup .
i get back to work and their are three packets in the bag .
then they ruined the fries by adding way too much salt .
i 'll assume it was because she was taking great care with my order .
gross !
i need to stop coming here just because it 's close to work .
this place is not very good .
was n't to happy with the cleanliness of this location .
their receipt machine along with the drive thru screen were not working properly .
and annoying .
the bad - here 's the reason for _num_ stars .
at best probably _num_ minutes old .
perhaps greet in english and tend to spanish customers instead .
over all i would n't recommend this jack in the box .
all a bunch of confusion to make more money .
he was just as bad as the other man who checked us in .
rude to the max .
that is not how you do business .
all these _num_ star reviews , he probably posted himself .
no way .
business _num_ - never be rude to the customer .
being nice goes a long way .
probably not .
so i called the attorney , straight to voice mail .
worst rental car experience i 've ever had .
the car was dirty and this guy conveniently found the windshield crack very quickly .
the car was pretty dirty and smelly .
this is a new company to me .
i did not receive a reply until _num_ or _num_ days later .
i would avoid renting a car from here at any cost !
there 's a reason this company gets _num_ stars .
they upscale and pressure you like no other car company i 've worked with .
they were too busy trying to upsell .
good for their business , bad for customers .
problems checking car back in on return .
will never rent again .
rented from them a year ago , thought i 'd try it again .
nothing really stood out for me except the prices .
my flight was _num_ minutes long .
my wait to get my internet reserved car was longer .
there were _num_ people at the counters .
avoid at all costs !
this was my first time renting from advantage .
i do n't think i 'll do it again .
the only reason for a _num_ star rating is for the long line .
way too long for a car rental , took about an hour .
but id rather pay a little extra for convenience .
worst experience renting a car i 've ever had !
first as a student .
financial aid is a nightmare at this campus .
they will lie to you and waste your time .
it is also a trap job for anyone looking to grow in the organization .
it does not matter if you can do a job or not .
if you are not on someone 's team you will not get hired .
i was only allowed to work _num_ hours and received no benefits .
they could n't understand that .
no matter how cute the package looks everything is n't pretty inside .
this place is not military friendly .
this college sucks .
do not come her unless you feel like pulling your hair out !
_num_ .
_num_ .
i 'm thinking , what the hell am i doing here ?
there was no direction for someone who has never been there .
it should not work that way .
not worth the $ _num_ for the ten minutes .
they were good when they were gas carts .
i was excited to try this place out .
it was n't a pleasant experience so we will not be going back .
such a pity because it 's a really cool environment .
place is extremely boring .
nothing is the same after they moved to this new location .
i just paid $ _num_ for two races , really ?
do not plan on just showing up , you must make reservations !
did i mention how expensive it is ?
imagine paying $ _num_ for your own _num_ kids to do _num_ races each !
they do n't care !
then , we were told that the wait was going to be _num_ hours .
when it was finally time for our race , it was underwhelming .
it was over in about _num_ minutes .
there are n't any fans or anything at all .
would n't be a place i would recommend !
this is no different .
unfortunately , the line was super long and they only had _num_ register open .
price difference $ _num_ .
old salad and rude service .
the drive-thru sign was on , but the open sign was off .
it turns out that they had just forgotten to turn the sign on !
overall , it 's a nice , little fish and chips place .
unfortunately i didnt like it .
the breading covering the fish was like bird food .
the service was bad .
so this is a place i will not go again !
fries were not salted and were tasteless .
overall , disappointing .
i wo n't be back .
slow services , mediocre value and dull flavors .
it was fresh testing but the bland breading did not due much .
nothing special .
cooked just right & crunchy as expected .
the fries were limp & flavorless .
not impressed at all .
they told me _num_ mins .
fries were soggy .
, bad .
ranch not homemade .
my experience was that the facilities and buses were dirty .
the facility lacked adequate security .
my latest experience : it was horrible .
greyhound quoted a price of $ _num_ for a one way ticket .
he printed out our tickets , which said we were confirmed .
and they 'd have to find the bus station in the dark - shoot .
buying tickets ahead with greyhound is n't the best idea .
if you do , confirm them , as the schedule may change .
there was some scary looking food sitting under heat lamps in the cactus caf .
the line for tucson was not the line for our bus .
luckily we asked , or we might 've missed our bus again .
by the time we boarded our bus , many seats were taken .
hanging out in a greyhound station is not my idea of fun .
so i suggest buying your tickets ahead of time to get the best rate .
i actually can think of nothing good about my last trip on greyhound .
but my advice is stay home or walk to your destination .
there always trash on the bus its disgusting .
the buses are filthy , but it 's cheap .
that 's the only reason why i 'm giving it a high rating .
so far the bus is still empty , hours into the trip .
someone should sue greyhound , and i 'm kinda hoping its me .
bought his ticket online and showed up at the phoenix terminal this morning .
am i missing something ?
)
no one there smiles but one security guard .
the rest looked liked they hated there job !
no help !
i 'd give them zero stars if possible .
after this trip i am never getting on a bus again .
one star is entirely too many !
the bus got to phoenix , and there my son stayed !
will i be calling the main office of greyhound demanding a partial refund ?
pathetic !
my recent experience with the phoenix greyhound bus station was terrible .
if you can avoid greyhound ( in phoenix ) ... do so .
but when i arrived to phoenix i had the most horrible experience .
this is by far the worst greyhound station i 've ever been to !
first , i called ahead to make sure i got priority seating .
yay for being next to the smelly piss for _num_ hours .
did n't i pay for this wifi ?
seriously difficult to deal with these people .
knew it would be a mistake taking greyhound again .
this trip i was simply trying to save money .
the gentleman obviously did not understand , so the attendant called security .
there was also an off duty attendant yelling as well .
customer service is not anything greyhound cares for .
this has been a horrid experience .
a greyhound station is never due a lot of stars .
this is the 3rd station i 've ever been in .
by comparison , this is the worst of the _num_ .
the counter staff is mostly rude and the drivers certainly need manners as well .
if i could give zero stars i would .
and absolutely no help from kim the employee in the red shirt .
terrible customer service .
worst greyhound yet .
do not use greyhound !
not even as last resort .
my bus is over four hours late and i 'm so livid right now .
the absolute worst !
the seats are narrow and uncomfortable , and the staff is rude and unprofessional .
avoid greyhound if you can .
we will never use greyhound again .
they are horrible !
this is not the first time either .
horrible .
rude staff and disgusting bus .
i feel dirty from even walking on the bus .
Negative
i 'm not given the option to give zero stars or negative stars .
be aware , way too lazy people working at this location .
i waited there about _num_ hours for the bus to roll in .
what the hell ?
because of this experience , i wo n't take greyhound again .
for a place open _num_ hours it was a welcome site .
we arrived and sat down at the counter looking over the menu .
the orange juice was in buckets ready to be refilled .
overall , i thought it was a little creepy and disturbing in the restaurant .
the food was not good .
i would only return to a waffle house if this was my only option .
i have been to many waffle houses before , but this one is gross .
i had to get up and leave due to general lack of cleanliness .
overall lack of cleanliness made us get up and leave .
i shall not come back to this particular waffle house .
there was never an apology for the wait or delay in our food .
the food is mediocre .
the service , attitude and cleanliness are beyond poor .
i will not be visiting this waffle house again !
this is n't the best waffle house in the area .
we sat at the counter and felt uncomfortable the whole time .
when we got our food it was n't comparable to other waffle house restaurants .
we got our food really spread out too .
we got those like _num_ minutes after all the other food .
mine was like half over done .
we would n't go to this one again .
i came here tonight ( a tuesday evening around 5:00 ) .
another _num_ minutes go by before we get our coffee ... but no water !
when we asked for more coffee she did n't come back .
can you believe that the server had lost our ticket ?
never coming back and this experience has put me off from any waffle house .
does n't matter we 're not going to any one of these places again .
_num_ star is too much .
i ca n't see how this place has as many stars as it does .
maybe i came on a bad night .
this piece of shit place does n't even answer the phone .
greasy , low quality , disgusting food .
but what you get is pretty bad .
the signature waffle was just ok , but nowhere near good .
how these chains are all over the country i have no idea .
sorry , america .
this was my first time eating breakfast here and it was n't all that .
i had cheesy eggs , hash browns , raisin toast , bacon and coffee .
he had _num_ waffle , bacon , eggs , hash browns and biscuit .
i left feeling full , but unsatisfied .
wish i had followed my first mind and went to ihop 's .
the service is piss poor and they ca n't get orders straight .
oh , just drive to the one on the _num_ and university .
this waffle house appeared dirty down to the dishes .
to top it off the food was not so good either .
it was pretty disgusting .
there were only _num_ other people in the restaurant at the time .
sadly i was mistake .
there hole staff is ghetto and trash .
all employees were loudly talking about drinking , partying , and other inappropriate things .
the food sucked and my server kelly was not very nice .
now i know why it 's called the awful waffle !
they do n't realize some young guys know their stuff .
overall bad people .
they sell everything without tax and are overall thieves .
twice now aaa has left me hanging for airport rides .
when i came out ten minutes later , he had already left .
ten minutes later , i call again .
same thing .
ten minutes after that , i call a third time .
same thing .
after another ten minutes , i finally decide to drive myself .
out of a sense of courtesy i call to cancel the pickup .
the operator tells me the cab is only _num_ minutes away !
only _num_ minutes ?
i was already _num_ minutes late !
the driver was not the issue .
he was on time , polite , and knowledgeable .
it took _num_ hours for anyone to come get us .
what happened after was worse .
_num_ weeks later we have no idea where these items are .
$ _num_ nightmare that no one seems to be able to help with .
no ? )
the whole thing makes me sick .
please do n't take this cab co. it really is that bad .
could they possibly have anyone more unfriendly answer the phone ?
two worst cab companies in phoenix az .
appointment with my primary care doctor last months too !
aaa transportation cabs & discount cabs totally !
this company is terrible .
i have not received a call .
not a sparkling review by any means .
it was cab _num_ .
he was pretty unfriendly and borderline rude .
he never offered any assistance for our baggage .
she was told _num_ min .
no one should ever have that much run around .
worst service i have ever heard of and experienced in my life !
this man got very rude rude with me and hung up twice .
they told me _num_ minutes .
_num_ minutes later i called back and they told me _num_ more minutes .
it 's currently been _num_ minutes and still no cab .
_num_ stars ... it was ok .
oh right ... i 'm not staying at a westin or anything .
the decor was ... plain .
oh right ... not a westin ... i keep forgetting .
not if i did n't have to .
wifi worked part time and even when it worked it was slow .
very close to airport but that is about the only plus .
i will not stay here again .
booked a room for mid april _num_ and unfortunately had a change of plans .
worst example of customer service i 've seen .
no call , no email , no contact .
he also says we can have _num_ % off another stay .
this has been an absolutely lousy experience .
secondly , the wi-fi had some problems at this hotel .
too pricey for the kind of service they offer !
they have let this property get very tired .
the carpets in the rooms are getting very dingy too .
sad because is a great location ?
extremely disappointed with this hotel .
the bathroom shower actually had mold growing in the bathtub above shower head .
stay away from room _num_ .
to date , i still have not gotten the bill .
to paint the picture in a couple words - bad communication .
would i refer someone else to do there roof with them ?
eh ... not sure .
no phone call , no e mail , no show !
boiled down to he did n't want to come for the appointment at 5pm .
i am truly disappointed in this place .
royal radiator is the worst mechanic i have ever dealt with .
the work they do is downright embarrassing .
after this experience , i warn everyone to stay away .
now they 'll almost guarantee that they do n't get repeat business !
he is no longer my friend .
i 've got nothing , it was awful , just awful .
it was stale .
it 's an ok stop if you do n't have much time for lunch .
but my sandwich was just ok.
the wheat roll was hard and chewy .
there is a _num_ cent additional fee for cards .
two weeks later they showed up at our door with no call or appointment .
the next day the inspector shows up and there shoddy work fails inspection .
_num_ weeks latter i get a email requesting payment .
i informed the salesman that a final inspection has not been done .
_num_ weeks gone by and no service.
bad customer service !
margarita the owner was not helpful to my needs !
lets just say it was ugly !
the worst acrylics i 've ever seen .
not exaggerating !
for the next _num_ days i was completely embarrassed !
no i did n't go back with my $ _num_ receipt .
i would n't recommend this place to my worst enemy !
zero stars !
i wo n't be going back .
overall , it was a really disappoint experience .
anyways , the soup was broccoli and cheese .
total was _num_ bucks .
not impressed .
the coffee is awful !
should n't it taste fresh brewed in the early a.m. ?
most importantly though , the service sucked .
the sandwich was reasonably thick with meat , greens and tomatoes .
at least the food would be good and the service predictable .
skip this place and try something else at breakfast .
the girl was very accommodating , so i ordered the spinach salad without bacon .
needless to say i will not be back !
i was shocked that a half of southwest chicken salad was $ _num_ .
not to mention it was not big at all .
this place is a disgrace on the original panera or paradise cafe .
i was boarding a late flight with only this place open .
a disgrace on the otherwise ok restaurant .
_num_ out of _num_ times i get mayonnaise & a dirty look .
if i could give the restaurant less stars i would .
ordered a pick _num_ combo with a smoked turkey sandwich and a southwestern salad .
i took one bite and it all fell apart .
it was n't our fault .
so awful .
the cashier repeated back , `` asian salad . ''
also ordered pick _num_ for my dining partner .
it was just chunks of fat and gristle .
so , so gross .
terrible , terrible service !
i do not recommend any travelers to eat here .
the only thing they really have going for them is the mac 'n cheese .
)
, probably not the place to go .
it also did n't help that both sandwich orders were messed up .
maybe i 'm just spoiled ... .
banana but muffin was good but undercooked .
paradise cafe was the only thing that seemed appetizing .
i ordered the turkey cranberry half sandwich and broccoli cheddar soup .
trust me , i looked multiple times .
paradise bakery in terminal _num_ c concourse is .
the worst .
i 'm a big fan of paradise , but this location is terrible .
it 's like everyone here is sour on their job .
lame company .
who really has time to stay home from 8am to 2pm waiting for them .
plus , they were super late past that six hour waiting period .
do n't recommend .
bad service .
they made no effort to meet or exceed expectations .
uh , unacceptable .
what the hell am i supposed to do that late ?
so , i was only trying to get a shorter time .
i have my glasses picked out and i needed them to drive .
so i called today and was told 1/2 hour and they will be ready .
they are n't even close to being ready .
awful service , unprofessional and unpleasant to experience .
i approached one of the sales associates and her attitude switch was on .
she was extremely rude .
thumbs down .
third dealer of the day and things are not so bad yet not improving .
why ca n't we be told this at the time of our request ?
they did n't care so honda ended up getting the business that time .
terrible service , , , my advice = avoid this dealership at all cost .
nope , no , nada !
i replaced my battery and left .
angry .
hello , ford motor co !
goodbye bell ford in phoenix , az .
poor customer service .
fake promises .
overall waste of time .
this place is horrible .
they give you the run around fake promises .
they are awful .
under no circumstances should you purchase from these scum bags !
do yourself a favor elsewhere for your ford !
do not give these guys your real phone number !
if they get your phone number you 're toast .
i 've asked to be taken off their list numerous times .
not even an attempt to do anything on the price .
i walked out and never looked back .
got charged $ _num_ for the _num_ oil changes i had during the plan .
the staff in the used car department obviously judge you by your appearance .
i walked the car lot for approximately ten minutes and still no salesperson around .
of course i did n't buy anything , who would ?
have n't heard from them so i 've made an appt .
very bad first impression for a loyal ford owner .
i recently was there with a friend looking at cars .
i would n't waste a second at bell ford .
disappointed in the commercial fleet service team at bell ford .
from now on , i 'll drive further for better service .
disappointed in phoenix !
since then i have never allowed any dealership to have my keys .
go see him , just do not get your car serviced here !
ugh this service department makes me so mad .
please think twice before you waste your time here .
i am very disappointed in the service that we have received .
we have a job that requires us to travel most all of maricopa county .
we popped the trunk to get the spare out and it was flat .
i will not buy from this dealership again .
no more .
strike _num_ , bell ford .
the problem has been , of course , after the deal .
when we checked the oil , it had clearly not been serviced .
that lie should have been my first red flag .
this has left a very bad taste in my mouth .
( _num_ calls now over the past week ) .
each time i am promised a return call .
just had a horrible experience .
i am buying a $ _num_ car and i need to work with you ?
was passed off between _num_ sales reps during visit .
sales `` manager '' came over and gave us ridiculous pricing .
very disappointing .
i have no business whatsoever being at a race track .
i know nothing about horse racing .
this place is an old horse track through and through .
that said , this place is an old horse track through and through .
service sucked .
nothing was comped .
so less a gripe about the establishment which is old and unsafe .
the beer was warm and the food was terrible .
we ordered _num_ meals and had to send _num_ back .
to top it off , the second race a horse got hurt .
terrible ... so sad !
_num_ horses killed at turf paradise in _num_ ... crazy .
its falling apart .
the track looks great but the building itself is complete garbage .
he was n't even here for _num_ minutes and charged me $ _num_ .
found out later that the part itself sells for _num_ to _num_ dollars .
do not use this company !
she made me not want to use this company .
thats terrible work ethic and i still stand on my first comment .
having recently cracked a tooth , i went looking for a dentist .
then i remembered , i had come in for tooth pain .
they did absolutely nothing for the complaint that i had come in for .
so , i was a little upset .
this company was not a preferred provider like they had told me before .
i 've never felt more cheated from a health care provider .
this is the worst dental office ever .
the atmosphere was mixed , children playing along side adults .
and omg we both hated it !
the rides are kinda lame .
this place is poorly designed .
the park is old and needs to be redone .
there are no rides for kids which is a big issue for me .
the bathrooms are so disgusting its pathetic .
it should only cost five dollars for locals .
upon entering the arcade , i was immediately disappointed .
i talked to arcade tech and he said that is what the game does .
i recommend if the rides are closed do n't waste your money .
no help .
the people before me has that problem as well .
the price i payed is not at all what i got out of it .
i probably wo n't go again .
not worth the price .
the day we went , several rides were closed .
they refused to accept it stating its not valid on holidays .
nowhere on their site does it say the coupon is n't valid today .
_num_ minutes later i gave up , and hung up .
wo n't be returning any time soon , very disappointing .
waste of money .
$ _num_ for unlimited rides ?
she pretty much just sat there disappointed for the five minute ride .
also , the beverages are outrageously priced .
most modern games area priced more than $ _num_ each play .
this place has potential , but it just does n't work right now .
but as is it feels like a tourist trap .
are you kidding me ?
my kids even got bored !
not worth it at all .
will not go back if i ever go to phoenix again .
the management deserves _num_ !
there were _num_ stools available in the arcade .
employees deserve a place to sit as well as patrons .
for patrons that would benefit from seating this is unacceptable .
it 's mediocre at best and the staff is n't very knowledgable or friendly .
your time and money is better spent at d & b or main event .
employees are rude and impatient .
never going back .
the place was pretty clean , not too crowded and prices were fine .
i went not expecting much and left feeling lucky i was alive .
service was n't the greatest but also was n't the worst i 've had .
apparently , they forgot to call me .
looked like the entirely wrong kit ( photo attached ) .
that 's not right . ''
i had an appointment to show the car that evening and was really irritated .
wo n't make that mistake again .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
but the service tech was given the wrong windshield .
the hole in my windshield looked large enough to stick a head through it !
and , this was n't it .
if you have time to waste , this is our place .
one look at the glass in the sun and i knew something was wrong .
1st time , they show up without a replacement windshield , so no repair .
how is _num_ customer service a business model ?
poor customer service .
gave me a _num_ hour window , missed it .
i pushed it back in , and proceeded to my appointment .
at this point , i drove to my local ford dealership .
absolutely terrible and deceptive .
they gave bad advice about how to care for the new windshield , too .
do n't believe all the hype .
what a complete and total waste of my time .
such an amateur mistake .
guess i 'll be looking else where for better service now .
horrible service !
the list goes on .
she did n't give a link or anything .
go elsewhere for your kids ' activities .
instructors are rude .
i feel that is very inappropriate .
they have promised to give me a refund as i was paid in full .
this company should be ashamed how little they care about the children .
the driver showed up right on time which was great .
better luck with your driver !
i have had one bad experience after another with these guys .
it was even still acceptable after it was cold as room temp .
however , my most recent call to them will also be my last .
yes , sir , like toppings and stuff .
missing sides that i had ordered but was charged for .
half the pizza had no toppings at all .
literally it took employees _num_ minutes for a simple order .
so i joined him for lunch .
$ _num_ beer if you order lunch .
i just do n't understand why this place is still in business .
rent must be really really low .
which is why we gave it a try .
ok , but not quite that good .
i think that would be it , yet it almost sounds too positive .
if your expectations are n't terribly highly then you wo n't be too disappointed .
the food is worth the money , nothing special .
it 's not one of those specifically great or specifically bad ones .
the only really good thing i got there once was their big breakfast .
ick !
gross !
i thought maybe it was better w/ the stuff added .
it was like the black hole of coffee condiments .
nasty , nasty , nasty .
mediocre fast food , fine .
but the extra _num_ min drive to starbucks suddenly looks much more reasonable .
do yourself a favor and avoid this location at all costs .
when i got my bag there was no ketchup !
despite no ketchup the french fries tasted better than the wrap thing i had .
_num_ mins in line .
took forever to get just one fish fillet even after waiting forever in line .
_num_ minutes in the drive thru .
_num_ of those minutes after i paid .
if i could give this location zero stars , that would be more accurate .
fault of an un experienced employee cost me .
Negative
if i could give negative stars to a company i would !
he was the worst person i could have spoken to at this point .
this seems very expensive as compared to a competitor .
overall , i did not feel valued as a customer .
they did not care to have my business .
i also only spoke with one person , which made me feel less confused .
they did n't really care though .
i would have to echo all the bad reviews on this page .
i used classic party rentals for my wedding .
a few days before the wedding so there was nothing they could do !
it did n't work , they looked like dead flowers .
absolutely the worst bouquet i 've ever bought .
do n't bother .
our wedding was almost ruined though their complete incompetence .
avoid this flower shop like the plague , especially for weddings .
i do n't know how they are still in business .
i 've been here twice and have gotten terrible service both times .
i will walk around the store , no one there to help .
i wait at the front for help and get ignored for a while .
about a week or _num_ ago , i went in to buy transmission fluid .
pointing does n't tell me anything .
yeah , ok , i guess that works .
there is n't supposed to be .
not a bunch like she claimed .
also , she saw that i had no stereo .
um , rude .
which , i do n't , but she does n't know this .
my friend was installing it for me .
the people who work here know nothing about vehicles .
my husband said that it was not leaking when we brought it in .
they have the worst customer service ever .
asked one employee ( red shirt ) for a screw for a bumper .
very poor service .
terrible !
they cancel for any excuse under the sun ( or lack there of ) .
i 've never witnessed anything like this in my life .
worst customer service ever .
thanks but no thanks .
they will no longer be getting our business .
so i drive from casa grande , az .
was a horrible experience .
this is just too small for me to waste my time on . ''
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
have n't received a call back from anyone more than a week later .
i took my car there _num_ times in _num_ weeks .
my car rarely breaks down !
but we would be left paying the towing .
bottom line is they just were n't doing the job .
same thing happened to my dad .
i wanted to like this place , but i did n't .
it was really dirty .
the bbq pork was overcooked and tough .
the sauce was so-so .
this place is mediocre at best .
all in all nothing was really that tasty .
at best , my meal was just shy of mediocre .
the pork was reheated in a microwave and the bbq sauce was bland .
i suspect it is purchased and not made in house .
even the sweet tea was lacking .
it 's just that the food is not special .
the service fees are ridiculous .
unless they change that i would not buy this unit .
if she does not qualify than no body should !
despite the signed agreement , they refused to provide the cooler .
this company is the worst .
still waiting for a manger to call me back .
poor customer service , ca n't wait to switch to another service .
horrible customer service !
mediocre tacos .
the baked goods on the other hand , i 'll be back to try .
highly disappointed today .
apparently , most food orders are for beef instead instead of chicken .
what i got was soggy chips under green chili .
everyone else ordered burritos , i bet they were delicious .
i did n't notice until i got home .
my loss , because it 's permanently stained .
i seriously wish i can give this place a _num_ star rating !
not going back .
i refuse pay for anymore services from firestone !
took the techs almost _num_ hours to do a simple oil change .
then they wanted to charge over $ _num_ to fix this problem .
i was frustrated and just left .
i understand you have labor charges but still over $ _num_ is ridiculous .
dont even waste your time or money !
she was just in a foul mood which is honestly not my fault .
it was very easy to find this so called company .
( i was charged $ _num_ for this install .
so far not really a problem .
is not covered .
i figured i would just let the whole thing go .
she just starts talking over me .
so i go ahead and give him a sample .
finally , she brings out the invoice .
i told him that wasnt gon na happen because she works weird hours .
that is pretty rude of you . ''
clearly he was annoyed with me , again .
i also told him they should pick a better time to do business .
no thanks !
very deceptive marketing practices and high pressure sales .
never even gave me the _num_ gift promised !
my wife assumed it was a state employee , and gave them a sample .
my wife declined , and was hung up on , very rude actually .
it 's not really `` mexican food '' .
horrible seafood .
horrible martinis .
returned half or food because it smelled so bad .
i 've had better elsewhere , but in a pinch , it 'll do .
the food was mediocre .
we have mixed reviews , ourselves , though .
inside , the place is old and worn , but clean .
there are fish tanks with large fish in them .
there are no other meats .
the fish tacos tasted extremely fishy and not in a good way .
it left a `` stale '' flavor in our mouths .
otherwise , skip it .
i 've had better elsewhere , but in a pinch , it 'll do .
they are slow and basically i ended up taking my vehicle elsewhere !
i payed them to find a leak which they never showed me .
they told me i needed a new oil cooler $ _num_ .
they gave me cold mac and cheese .
worst service ever .
i wo n't likely ever order food from here again .
we ordered egg rolls and my husband said this was his favorite thing .
very black peppery and not very many vegetables .
i did n't like it .
the last thing we ordered was the vegetable fried rice .
boring .
the total bill was $ _num_ .
enough food to feed _num_ people at least .
we had tons of leftovers and no one is really wanting to eat them .
do not go here at all .
the people that run this place are not nice to customers at all .
this place is disgusting .
gross , i will never eat there again .
that was n't the case today .
the person that answered the phone said `` no delivery driver today '' .
so , whatever , no problem .
he said `` no , we do n't do that . ''
they give me the number of the closest pizza hut .
the pizza hut does n't have a door .
there are _num_ groups already there ahead of me .
down to _num_ of us .
i grab my pizzas and i 'm out of there .
i will not order from this location again .
they have workers there that ring up pizza specials that they no longer offer .
then you can avoid these types of problems .
no wonder pizza hut has gotten bad reviews and ratings !
not even worth the one star rating we are forced to give !
pizza was never delivered .
Neutral
i would give negative stars if i could .
when it finally arrived it was cold .
not even luke warm .
it 's a complete joke .
called today to order a pizza was told they wo n't deliver to me .
no reason why .
guess my money is n't green enough for them .
Negative
i want to give negative stars but i ca n't .
this has got to be the worst store ever .
this is n't the first time that this has happened .
worst service .
horrible service and delivery times are out of control !
smh
if i could give negative stars i would .
needless to say , we will not be giving them anymore chances .
avoid this dump at all cost .
you 've been warned .
i dont think these people are not aware of what they eat .
i purchased some today and they are n't good enough for hungry dogs .
if u warm them up wow they turn into a hard crumb making mess .
i said , `` no problem , i understand .
warning : they were recommended on angie 's list , too !
for me , it is all about first impressions .
they scheduled a project specialist to come out that week .
the specialist called me and confirmed the appointment .
he was very knowledgeable and polite .
a week passed and no email .
finally , i get a call that evening .
it makes me think they just forgot or did not care .
they responded to my follow up emails within minutes .
i urge you to get other estimates especially in the tucson area .
run , do n't walk away from this company .
after i signed my contract and put down my deposit , the problems began .
some excuse , we 're sorry , etc .
morning of the project start date and i have no workers at my home .
do you not have a computer system that you use for notes ?
guess what , no call .
the buyer 's inspector noted a few issues with the replaced roof .
they were mostly minor - but failed inspection nonetheless .
once they had their cash in hand we apparently were not worth their time .
the sales guy apparently cant add .
so why was i shown this tile by the sales rep ?
i approved , not having a better choice .
the tile from the bone yard was delivered .
there was no final inspection .
do not hire this company !
loose fruit and veggies - um , no .
i was so wrong .
the prices are not great compared to the service of the store .
this place is the worst .
very unsatisfied with the professionalism and with the bike repair .
my issue is that we did not discuss work that would double my bill .
i will have to keep looking for a reliable small engine mechanic .
they do n't even deserve one star .
horrible customer service with even worst employees .
do n't waste your time coming to this shake .
the worst customer service in the industry .
nothing else to say ... .
left empty handed .
it also made me not want to eat a burrito from any other place .
fairly mediocre .
worst customer service ever !
i was so mad and asked to be refunded .
i have been here three times and i 'll never go here again .
i went to the drive-thru and sat and waited and waited about five minutes .
i explained that nobody had taken my order at the speaker .
he looked at me like i just killed somebody .
clearly a speaker problem , not me .
this they could handle without a problem .
it seems that that 's all they 're capable of doing .
april _num_ : god damn you .
and my tacos were crammed with lettuce .
i had my order in under _num_ minutes .
tacos are now _num_ cents .
it was 11pm and we had just gotten back from the phx airport .
this del taco is n't in the best place of town .
i like del taco it reminds me of might taco in buffalo ny .
but this is the hands down the worst location del taco owns .
the dang sour cream cost as much as the tacos but i like it .
go next door to taco bell or whataburger .
when my turn came , nobody was answering at the drive thru .
not only about when they close , but when they open .
supposed to be open at 8:00 am on weekends .
if i could rate this company it would be _num_ stars .
del taco you need more professional involved with your company .
worst pharmacy , ever !
so my boyfriend was the first to report it ?
the food itself is just ok at best to me .
they have decent thick cut fries , but not the best .
they can sometimes be overly soggy .
sadly , i wanted to cry but not in the way i had hoped .
their gyros are gigantic and they do n't skimp on the lamb or chicken .
but the flavor was a bit off .
also , i was n't a fan of their tzatziki sauce .
it was a bit runny and tasteless for me .
the people here have no sense of customer service .
the facility is old and the furnishings dated .
the pita was fine , but nothing to write home about .
one other thing i do n't understand is their odd hours .
guess i 'll have to use the del taco drive-thru next door .
the large greek salad ( $ _num_ ) i got was horrible .
what a waste of money .
that was not a greek salad .
the greek olives were mushy and the bread looked stale .
this place sucks .
just got back from lunch after trying it for the first time .
needless to say , i wo n't be going back !
service was bad .
overwhelmed staff at lunch rush .
not given receipt or ketchup for my fries .
if i want a chain style sandwich i would opt for cheba hut .
not much better than subway in my opinion .
i thought the sourdough bread was a bit hard and stale tasting .
no fresh brewed tea .
i do n't intend to go back .
i will never use or refer anyone to this company .
great customer service , poor execution .
so , obviously same day service was not an option .
we were talking about the _num_ % and _num_ % screens .
so , he did the measurements same day .
i had already left a deposit with the initial order .
i could n't believe it .
friday was the only day it could be done .
they said it was n't possible because the tech has another apt that day .
do they only have _num_ technician ?
my suggestion is get estimates and use another company .
i called them back and they said that i in fact called and cancelled .
i told them it was impossible for me to have done that .
would not recommend these people unless you want to keep calling them back .
i do n't know why they were in such a rush .
this is a job which takes between _num_ - _num_ minutes by a professional .
i was told the owner was out of town and could n't be reached .
i gave them one star because there is nothing lower .
it is now june and it has not been picked up !
one of the worst companies i ever deal with .
then i request for refund , and they did n't give it back .
!
worst customer service ever !
this is one of the worst companies i 've ever dealt with .
with that kind of customer service they will not be busy for very long .
they did not call me before or after finishing the work .
i do n't understand how they are still in business .
the last two stops i could n't even eat them and i love fries !
i wo n't be going back .
she was also beginning to have difficulty feeling when she had to poop .
i had the meatloaf and it was not so good .
this last week we stopped for lunch and i ordered a burger .
the patty tasted like the frozen ones you buy at safeway .
it was tough and tasted like it had been frozen .
the lunch food for me has been consistently terrible .
walked in at _num_ minutes past _num_ and was told they were closed .
and then , never bothered to offer to make it right for me !
the omelet that i ordered was not what came to the table .
i wanted to like this place , but it just did n't come together .
however , he is supposed to cover this area .
very disappointing .
do n't waste your time .
truly disappointed .
i would give zero stars if possible .
ridiculous .
terrible customer service !
he had terrible reading and listening skills and even worse customer service .
and i sent a lengthy email back about how disappointed i was .
she apologized and said jim the owner would be in touch with me .
she sent me a message this morning referring me to a baby proof company .
no name , just a number .
should have paid more for my pool fence .
fortunately it was only a few small areas , but it 's still unacceptable .
last , they did n't even properly secure the gate .
recently went through a manager change and the place is going down hill .
not the best customer service , no house keeping , bathroom was n't cleaned .
horrible mistake .
_num_ .
customer service - horrible .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
lazy front desk .
_num_ .
smoking and non-smoking rooms are on the same floor .
you can hear noise from _num_ rooms down if you step out your door .
worst place i have ever stayed .
altogether i was very disappointed .
do n't stay here if you have any self respect .
do n't stay here .
this place is awful .
so i walked to the front desk with wet hair and inquired .
nothing else ; no variety .
they are also hard to track down .
warning do not stay at this hotel !
ugh .
it 's a horrible experience living here .
tho room is terribly dirty with spots on the towels and sheets .
they do n't even have a hair dryer and coffee maker .
i was traveling alone for business and arrived late at night .
awful , so disgusting in all ways .
terrible .
would never return if i did not have to .
but still , ugh !
do not stay at this location .
room was not cleaned on second day .
i could have stayed in sheraton at the price we paid to stay here .
i asked for some shampoo , and she gave it to me .
so then i went to bed .
confused ... .
they let me know _num_ minutes before i was to walk in there .
i disagree , this taco bell is not the best .
whataburger disappointment !
i do n't know why i stopped here for lunch this afternoon .
i looked at her then politely said `` umm hello ?
miss , what are you looking at ? ''
no i 'm not gay and yes i do have standards .
this was not mediocre in any way , but virtually inedible .
absolutely the worst burger i 've ever eaten in my life .
however , i could not finish the burger .
there was so much grease .
i regret not going to in-n-out burger .
nasty !
i do n't know how people eat here .
none ... not even a hint of green chile flavor .
the hamburger itself was gray , tasteless .
i do n't know how they are still in business because it was disgusting .
first , the decor is so outdated it feels dirty and old .
by the time it came out correctly everyone else was done eating .
the burger was greasy and flavorless .
i did n't finish it and wo n't be back .
worst whataburger i 've ever been .
cold tasteless food is what this place has .
sorry no second chances for this place .
this place is horrible .
he started yelling at me and ran to his car and took off .
it was ridiculous .
the other half of the room was empty so we asked to sit there .
this was really annoying , but we were n't offered any excuses or apologies .
the wait staff is friendly and there is plenty of seating .
my group of about _num_ people stopped in here on a dead friday night .
apparently we were wrong .
we left after _num_ drink because she was so rude and unwelcoming .
this place is straight up creepy and run down .
avoid at all costs .
no it 's still open for business .
i spilled a beer all over myself .
stupid me .
i waited _num_ minutes .
can i get this beer removed ?
food sucked also as bad as the service .
)
not good times .
for a two day business trip , i stayed at the hilton garden inn .
the bulk of my complaints concern the bathroom .
well , skip this one .
in all the hotels i 've stayed in this was the worst mattress .
did n't sleep at all .
i would have been better off going out to my car for sleep .
the white bread ( not toasted , but totally dried out was also moldy .
disappointed for a hilton .
while room was large and spacious , bathrooms were dated .
air is loud and noisy as well .
just disappointed ... .
i would have been better off with a carl 's jr $ _num_ burger .
the hotel staff in my hotel even told me their burgers were great .
fire alarm at _num_ am .
workout facility is mediocre .
terrible .
very noisy .
first room was noisy .
do n't recommend this place unless i just got the bad room .
my husband and i just ate there .
that is no bread and a side salad instead .
it looked like something you would get in a mall food court .
the only vegetarian option was a grilled cheese sandwich .
i ca n't believe i just ate at this place !
did everything they could to avoid doing the right thing .
what a waste of a year !
we made a huge mistake by trying to work with this company .
i had a terrible moving experience with s & m movers and united .
every load they delivered was crushed or in pieces .
my kitchen table was unable to be repaired .
( thus , the reason i hired movers to begin with . )
try another company and hopefully you 'll have better luck !
this company is by far the worst moving company i have experienced .
he was there on time but s & m was n't .
he called them and they told him they had no appointment set with him .
he went over in detail with them what was going etc .
i told them it probably was n't that hot at 8:00 am .
there were multiple inventory tags on some items and none on others .
i asked what it said and the driver could n't read it either .
terrible !
holy cow what a horrible experience !
oh and guess when my stuff comes back to california ?
the absolute last day of the _num_ week window .
will never use united van lines again because of s & m moving .
this place is terrible !
the people working inside are very rude and are very unhelpful .
i took it back and they would n't refund me the money .
they only exchanged it for another one .
i 've had nothing but bad luck !
too pricey for south phoenix .
how does that happen , subway !
the course was beat up and the greens were in horrible condition .
the staff seemed to lack professionalism and overall golf etiquette .
my advice : drive _num_ yards farther west on baseline and play legacy .
ben advised no as i was getting cheap golf .
at that point he was offered several tee times by courtney .
she did not ask me if i had the discount card .
i asked for tee times on the thursday morning and was offered several .
staff was like they did not want us there.
pro shop employees are rude .
which made me even more frustrated .
the course was good but the service was horrible .
no more !
because this was not good pizza .
greasy , sure .
but there was no flavor .
it sounds worse than that .
- i did n't have to cook .
quite simply , you get what you pay for .
poor horrible quality !
you would feel like you just walked in a oven ... .
both times i went the service was horribly slow .
the place felt hot and there were flies everywhere .
she insisted it worked .
this place sucks .
yes they have a lot of stuff however customer service is nonexistent .
the young asian lady is always nice but the guy is rude .
i 've never had a dishonest experience at a discount tire .
very very very bad service !
these guys can not be trusted .
i ca n't believe that discount tire tried to pull this on us .
they had n't even pulled it into the bay yet .
i do n't have high hopes .
i actually did a lot of research before picking this place .
the food was horrible .
my mother had heart failure .
the nursing staff i saw the friday i visited were less than professional .
slow call button response had me moving my mother to the restroom myself .
this place is terrible !
they seriously need to investigate the treatment at this facility it 's unacceptable !
since then everything has been very slow .
i would not recommend this place .
i could n't agree more with all the _num_ star reviews .
the staff are unprofessional and incompetent .
the place smells of urine and is not clean .
they do not wash their hands between patients .
if you do , you will regret it .
very friendly teachers and staff , but definitely not the place for us .
kids do not even have to attend really and they pass .
absolutely horrible service .
service was terrible and staff was very unfriendly !
tonight was our first time eating here .
i ordered the taco chicken salad and it looked incredible !
they even gave me a $ _num_ dollar discount off our bill .
sadly , the customer service has declined .
if we ca n't even get that , why be open ?
food was good very tasty , but service was totally crappy .
nothing good to say about this place .
very disappointed .
no manager on duty tonight .
all the kid ( workers ) are playing around behind the counter .
order was wrong .
the lunch buffet is $ _num_ , but it is awful .
i will not be returning .
the worst !
i 've had three bad experiences .
a few weeks later i went and again stood in line for a lifetime .
ok , my fault for not bargain shopping .
that fish could kill me !
i just do n't want to have to survive my dinner .
cashier : `` no ! ''
cashier : `` no ! ''
she should n't assume i did n't know what she was saying .
cashier : `` i could get fired for giving you my personal information .
i just ca n't steal points from safeway .
but agree the staff is terrified to actually help you .
not worth the extra money they charge compared to fry 's .
wait times in line are ridiculously long .
hire more cashiers on days you know it will be busy !
not a fan of this store and it 's unfortunate because i love safeway .
just make new , there is nothing wrong with a little pride safeway .
this store sucks .
i 'm weary of this place.
skimpy on the beef and wo n't honor free cookie coupon .
breakfast was bacon , eggs , pancake .
all in all , was n't a ride to write home about .
he make me a crown that i do n't need it !
screwed my teeth !
my experience at baseline dental care was a mixed bag .
the way this was handled upset me .
i had never met him before .
it was right before christmas and i was in pain .
the staff who answered the phone informed me the dentist was n't there .
they refused but they were pretty mad at baseline too and called them .
one dentist assistant who was pleasant and gentle with me was michelle .
i went to baseline dental for cleaning and the annual x-rays .
the last time i went there was in summer of _num_ .
how else could he afford to drive nice vehicles ?
terrible !
ordered pepperoni pizza and wings ( $ _num_ ) .
wings were fatty disgusting and soggy .
pizza was mediocre at best .
simply the worst pizza in the valley .
this is not one of them .
also , no air conditioning in phoenix in august .
i agree with the other posters on one thing though .
the crust is like cardboard , sometimes even a little burnt .
i do n't know how this crust was made .
stopped in , no pizza ready .
i checked my phone right there , no missed calls .
told me it would be _num_ - _num_ minutes .
_num_ - _num_ minutes later , pizza is done .
get it home , no canadian bacon .
while waiting , i saw them opening giant cans of pre-made pizza sauce .
this place is horrible !
the pizza and wings were disgusting !
we were so embarrassed to have brought this horrific food !
there was no flavor to the sauce .
they were not edible .
unfortunately we had picked up _num_ large pizzas and _num_ orders of wings .
it was very expensive for such low quality !
for the record , these comments came from about _num_ of our party guests .
the kids would not even eat it !
i was very disappointed with this place .
the crust was like cardboard and the sauce was nothing special .
honestly , little caesar 's would have been better .
slow service .
the employees i encountered barely speak english .
too bad there is n't a management number to call .
i was bumped _num_ times today .
there is some seating , but not much .
and then i stopped coming with my mom .
just eh .
but alas , it 's just a lil bit below average .
i did n't know what i was walking into and did not feel welcome .
worst customer service ever !
so not worth it !
not worth paying _num_ dollars for .
why did n't you tell me it was this far ?
i called back complaining and never got the money put back .
lame .
it was so bad he did n't even eat it .
was disgusting too , not even like clear oil but dark brown grease .
it was incredibly loud and every table had a crying baby .
also , our waitress was awful .
the zucchini appetizer is off the menu , big disappointment .
my beef tamale was awful .
i would have sent it back had my waitress ever returned .
my chicken enchilada was edible but tasted like one of those frozen entrees .
the enchilada was okay , but the tamale flat out sucked today .
i ate here last spring and ordered the chicken fajitas .
my dad ordered the steak fajitas ... again with the soy sauce .
i would not eat here again .
but this was horrible .
but to make matters worse , my fajita was the most disgusting thing ever .
i 've been a patron of this establishment since i was a young child .
however , i was deeply disappointed in what i experienced .
i tasted no cream cheese .
it tasted like sour cream with chunks of jalepeno .
even the jalepeno did n't taste like jalepeno !
the chicken was flavorless .
i could n't tell there was chicken in it .
she complained that it was also had no flavor and got sick afterward .
hardly an empty table which seemed like a good sign .
no sides , no toppings , just orange goo .
the beef taco was horrible .
i wo n't be back .
food sucks , service sucks , and the atmosphere sucks .
Negative
wish yelp allowed negative stars .
ok food but horrible service .
arrived in about _num_ minutes to give them time to make our office order .
this has to be some of the worst food in all of phoenix .
the dining experience , is a big , giant fail .
the place is disorganized from room to room and crowded .
needless to say my return factor is not even a _num_ % .
poor nice bartender .
we left a little disappointed .
`` i could get something just like this at del taco . ''
it was then drowned in a white cream cheese jalapeo sauce .
all very salty to me .
i was was so excited to have lunch there .
not impressed .
i really liked minced onions and these were not minced .
maybe they should warn you about the onions !
we ordered a chimichanga with red chili and a smothered chicken burrito .
_num_ minutes later we got our food and ordered was all wrong .
the only thing i liked was the chips !
worst service ever !
i called in so i would n't have to wait .
the place was fairly crowded with a line about _num_ minutes wait time .
there was a very distinct smell around our table in the room .
the menu provided some traditional mexican food items , which were fairly authentic .
however , the chips and salsa were underwhelming at the best .
my first time here and i left never wanting to come back again .
more customer service .
not once did she say she will be right with me .
came here the other day and i honestly feel like this place is overrated .
for this kind of food it 's nothing i ca n't make at home .
went for lunch with _num_ of the girls .
when asked if they had anything hotter or spicier , the answer was no .
i ordered a cheese crisp , it came out as a cheese limp .
she said it had more sour cream in it than avocado .
none of the food was seasoned .
then to add insult they added _num_ % gratuity to a party of _num_ !
terrible customer service !
my third bad experience in a row .
i will not be calling back later .
i will not be calling back ever .
too bad i used to like that place .
disgusting atmosphere .
go somewhere else .
they lost our order and we had to wait for them to make it .
the worst customer service ever !
never again .
worst customer service .
place has really gone down hill .
it use to be my favorite ... .
so tonight was a different experience than in the past .
tonight , we had our meal as usual .
i was n't impressed by the food or experience .
the food was not bad , but the restaurant was filthy !
sorry but they just do n't cut it .
the enchilada was better of the two in my opinion .
and the prices were soo cheap .
made me not want to eat there again that 's how bad it was .
the food was microwaved , and overcooked .
simply the worst dining experience i 've had .
from the moment i walked in the experience was just awful .
boxes which was really confusing since we had n't even placed our order .
about _num_ minutes into our meal , the check was dropped off .
we felt we were being rushed out of the establishment .
all-in-all , it was a disappointing experience .
i will not eat here ever again !
tried to call in order .
girl who answered the phone seemed lost and requested we be place on hold .
i order veggie fried rice , veggie egg rolls and fried chicken wings .
the rice had the same fried , sweet , dirty taste .
horrible food .
ripoff , unprofessional and rude staff !
all she could do was lie and make excuses .
i am extremely upset and will not be going back to this location !
this was not acceptable .
do n't waste your time .
but i can find that in my back yard .
i get the feeling the customers are trying to hard too .
this place is just not for me .
well this is the review i to farms comment site .
spent _num_ dollars .
place had may be _num_ % of its tables busy .
in all , spent _num_ hours for a two course meal .
could n't cut my pork belly with the knife .
in all , i wo n't be back unless you change the situation .
guess the change in head chefs was a big deal after all .
have n't been there in a year but it has gone down hill .
this used to be my favorite breakfast place but something has changed .
the food looks like the chef does not care .
there was no garnish on the plate , my eggs were cold .
i visited the farm for the first time today and frankly , was disappointed .
no big as it gave me time to walk the grounds .
did no one see this ?
it was gross .
no thanks .
to sit on the chairs .
are awful and no one wears gloves at all !
not going back .
but the restaurants are far to expensive to even bother trying the food !
the small treats , like bars , muffins , etc .
are expensive as well .
surrounding area with picnic tables was nice though .
the sandwiches were fine , if heavy on the mayo .
ahh yes , the farm kitchen at the farm at south mountain .
finally got around to doing just that on sat , may 3rd , _num_ .
why no tip you ask ?
there is no service here .
so they got _num_ % of my order wrong .
this should have been at the very most , $ _num_ to $ _num_ .
i 'm never going back .
i was so embarrassed when they ran out of food !
_num_ guests showed up .
it was very disappointing .
over $ _num_ .
this experience was anything but fun from the beginning .
to list your sides that you could choose from .
it was n't even half full !
the cupcake was ok , moist but no flavor .
i shop at specialty shops all the time , and this was a disgrace .
long wait at the one outdoor restroom in a trailer .
all in all it was about _num_ bites of food .
when our bill arrived our entrees totaled $ _num_ .
it was completely ridiculously overpriced .
_num_ minutes for a table after we were told the wait would be _num_ .
_num_ minutes for a server to come to the table .
terrible mimosas .
_num_ minutes to get breakfast .
service was terrible .
terrible .
first time experience dining in was disappointing .
with the mandatory _num_ % gratuity , not worth it .
i do not understand why we pay a gratuity for nothing ?
they 're the worst .
no waiter or waitress service .
if i 'm back in another _num_ years it will probably be too soon .
which in pedicure language is not a good thing .
very loud !
my _num_ year old granddaughter could have done a better job .
i never really do reviews but this place was terrible had to share .
women who did my nails was terrible and rude !
the nail technician was rude and rushed me .
when i inquired about it the first time , she cut me off .
however , i 'm quite sure she was knowledgeable of her actions .
i will no longer visit this establishment .
i had had the taco salad and was very disappointed .
it was just meh .
overall ... skip this place .
i would skip it and go to another place .
i live close to this bakery and barely went the second week in december .
acting cold like i was asking for too much she handed me one .
she was quite rude and did not issue me a calendar .
she did n't like the way i looked ?
worst service ever !
lady was a little rude .
wo n't be back .
i contacted my sales rep afterwards and you guys said nothing could be done .
you guys acknowledged my frustration but said nothing could be done .
yet they still died .
the prices are out of sight .
the customer service is ... wait can i get someone to help me ?
not a soul in sight .
however , _num_ % + of everything they have has no price listed !
cons : no service and no prices listed !
worst customer service received since moving to arizona _num_ years ago .
purchased $ _num_ pot _num_ weeks ago .
clearly a miserable person with zero soft skills .
easily the worse course i have played in phoenix .
but thats really the only positives about this place .
the fairways were in bad condition as well .
finally , the bunkers had rocks and no sand .
there are much better golf courses around this place .
i do not recommend this course .
a reasonable price but still not worth the money .
they need much better signage .
so disappointed .
the course was in such terrible shape .
it looked ridiculous .
i would rather of paid a little extra to play a nicer course .
when you put everything together it tasted alright but it was just dry chicken .
i was greeted kindly as i walked in the door .
the building and peking lot are run down form the outside .
the inside was clean enough for me did n't bother me .
my mom on the other hand , would have tucked tail and ran .
all were too salty .
sadly , i do n't think i will ever go back .
cheap cushions unfortunately .
was n't happy with the pricing either .
a `` level _num_ for the price of a level _num_ '' .
all in all , disappointed .
go figure i guess they do n't need my business that bad .
i only gave them _num_ stars because it was dirt cheap .
this place is the worst .
this place sucks , i ca n't believe they are open for business .
perhaps because the lunch special price is cheap at $ _num_ .
the egg rolls , just stay away from them .
they are horrible , like seriously .
lady in the white shirt was so rude .
rushed me out of the restaurant within _num_ minutes of me sitting down .
this makes leaving flowers and other items for your loved one near to impossible .
shame on you !
this is an absolute horrible place for veterans !
this is plain ridiculous .
this is the worst jack in the box around .
another time i got _num_ regular burgers instead of the sandwich i had ordered .
all of the employees were right there , completely ignoring customers at the counter .
)
i am giving a _num_ because i can not give a zero .
last night me and my fiance visited for food after seeing a concert .
if that wasnt bad enough my croissant was partially burned .
not over done but black .
i said whatever and figured i would call and address this in the morning .
apparently one is not there on the weekends .
nope .
not so much as a `` how do you do ? ''
your restaurant and employees give fast food chains a bad name .
i wrote an email to the _num_ teachers .
they never returned my email or talked to me again .
this was very painful and unexpected .
rooms do n't have lighting , unprofessional maintenance .
horrible experience .
luxury is only in the price .
our experience through the application process was terrible .
do not rent here or even apply .
the paperwork went back and forth , but i never saw it .
at no point did anyone contact me and tell me if i even qualified .
if i could rate this place a _num_ i would !
everyone there doesnt seem to have their ducks in a row .
no wonder they keep changing management .
it all went downhill from there .
do n't move here , take it from your buddy mark .
they 'll say they 're going to fix the gates , they wo n't .
waste of time .
so this is a _num_ star review kids .
a 3-5 mile hike turned into _num_ miles .
but it gets boring fast .
all lights and tv were on .
i did n't even get service here because they tried to rip me off .
i went in and just the feel of this urgent care is not good .
long story short , they have no clue about how insurance billing is done .
avoid them !
this is unacceptable and frankly , pathetic .
is n't that just sad ?
do not go to this sun devil auto .
it would n't start well when cold .
the next day , the car still did n't run any better .
( actual repair cost around $ _num_ ) .
this guard had not been replaced correctly after sun devil did work .
i will never let anyone i know go to this place .
i went to the mcdowell location and dealt with the manager , barry .
this shop is total crap .
needless to say , i have not been back to this location since .
please do me favor do not go there for an oil change .
they have the worst customer service .
horrible , horrible !
sun devil auto destroyed the engine on my truck !
it was not low when i took the truck in !
i had already purchased a clutch kit and just needed someone to install it .
do not rent equipment at this ace location .
i showed an associate a picture of ace brand grass seed in my phone .
wo n't be back to this ace due to this experience .
if your a veteran , avoid this place .
the franchise owner does n't give the veteran 's discount .
teenagers are walking around in the middle of the night being loud .
my neighbors down stairs are always fighting and i can hear the wife crying .
so ... cheap apartment = ghetto and headaches .
it smells like weed constantly .
fine , not like i really want to go swimming in a freezing pool .
cheap apartments , and for good reason .
appliances and cabinets are really old , unless you pay extra for an upgrade .
maintenance is questionable .
i had never seen him before and i was naked .
this is because my lease expired and i 'm month to month .
renew my lease .
this place was the most disgusting and unorganized place i ever lived !
so disgusting !
i tried taking my complaints to the corporate office , with no avail !
it was horrible !
i could n't wait to get out of there !
i would not even give you people a star .
i can not believe someone lets this place run like this .
your water bill changes every month and it is a ridiculous amount .
as other have mentioned , parking is horrible .
other than that , nothing else will fit .
it was weird how different spots were different sizes .
for the most part i had decent neighbors on _num_ out of _num_ sides .
my neighbors across the hall and below me were horrible .
the pool area was difficult to get into and out of .
my neighbors had _num_ people living in a _num_ bedroom .
by far the worst complex i have ever lived in !
this place is still horrible .
do n't be an idiot like me , go elsewhere .
the management is the worst i 've ever come across .
you wait , and wait for the work to get done .
i tried living here twice and nothing has changed .
the people they let move in most are alcoholic scum .
my ceiling leaked all winter they did nothing .
_num_ other issues within our unit in just three months .
i highly advice you live elsewhere .
if i could , i would give this place _num_ stars .
there were roaches underneath the hood above our stove .
the outlets did not work , very loose .
i showed the yelp offer , and they took the keys .
i expected a few maintenance issues , but this caught me off guard .
_num_ stars for customer service & a checkin offer .
_num_ for the latter .
i politely declined and went to get a second estimate elsewhere .
my car needed none of the repairs i 'd been quoted on .
so my advice is be careful .
after the problem continued i took it to another mechanic .
when i spoke with them regarding this issue they were very rude and aggressive .
the steering was clearly loose and so noticeable i would have noticed this before .
be very careful with this place .
you have been warned .
_num_ hour wait for an oil change , no thanks .
it 's bs , wo n't go back .
i should have left when i smelled the place .
husband ordered beef with broccoli - it was cold .
do n't waste your time .
go to great wok instead for great take out .
nothing to write home about .
lots of food , but not much flavor .
hubby had szechuan chicken .
they were big , but again - not very flavorful .
all in all , not worth the wait or the money .
unfortunately i was n't able to keep this trust in him .
that does not go to say that he is necessarily to blame for this .
this really left an awful taste in my mouth .
but wait , there 's more .
because why would anyone question it any further ?
very poor customer service !
i will definitely not be back to his office .
i can not believe all the great reviews for toy town .
i gave the one star for the owner .
very nice person but just being a nice person did not help the rest .
it was very dirty and unorganized .
it looks outdated and very unprofessional .
there was a sign from a bank and some plastic money on a table .
there is no place for a parents to be besides two rocking chairs .
i really like the idea of this place .
they offered no alternatives for me and did not offer to refund anything .
this place is a rip off .
do not purchase any kind of voucher or gift certificate from them .
`` you guys have any specials running tonight ? ''
`` that 's not part of the special . ''
so ... it 's not all domestic drafts .
i ca n't stand stuff like this .
the guy was friendly enough though .
i 'm going to try to avoid this place .
fail .
but overall this is not my scene .
i tried some myself and it was truly awful pizza .
the more i think about this meal , the more upset i get .
a little adult interaction might do him good !
my girlfriends and i wo n't be going back for happy hour .
visited this location for the first time tonight .
the chicken sandwich was excellent , very tasty .
the wings were just fine , but the restaurant seemed dirty .
seems to be going downhill .
it almost feels like they 're trying to cut corners .
lunch service seems worse than dinner .
she needs to go because she ca n't handle the pressure .
now everything but the chicken sucks and sucks badly .
i go here to sing karaoke , i 'll eat someplace else .
that is not customer service .
today , my mother and i went to native for dinner .
as we walked in , the hostess was blatantly unfriendly and unorganized .
i was disappointed .
i will try this place again , i always give places another try .
as i waited ... my husband comes back and still no check .
native new yorker is not the same as it use to be .
no sign was seen and our waitress also did not alert us .
lame ... bring back the old native new yorker and management .
we came on sunday , and the wings are crazy cheap .
the patio had not many places to put your used cigarettes .
i was really disappointed when i saw this .
we did not get enough wings .
there were only _num_ wings for the _num_ of us for each dish .
overall , this is simply not the greatest restaurant i 've experienced .
thanks , but i 'd rather visit the ahwatukee location from this time on .
my wings were so dry , there was barely any sauce on them .
it 's your money people , it 's your choice .
came here today for the _num_ cent wings with co-workers .
wings were good , but the service was bad .
very slow .
the worst possible service ever .
not to mention the diet coke which she finally brought as a doctor pepper .
_num_ min later i get a diet coke and its flat .
it 's hard for them to cook your food the way you want it .
sarah was rude .
_num_ of us in our group are in the industry .
if you do n't want people drinking cut them off .
do n't suggest coffee or ignore them or not offer last call .
i will not be back .
is n't the point of your establishment is to enjoy food and drinks ?
this place is the worst and i will not be going back !
food came late , drinks were n't refilled in a timely manner .
everything was overcooked .
the server was great but very disappointed in the food .
it was not my hair color at all !
horrible service !
worse place i have ever lived .
since then , our showers are still having problems .
you people are freaking crazy .
i see .
said too many others rented & they came first .
you can really hear upstairs neighbors walking .
i know cockroaches happen but gross .
but for $ _num_ a month it 's not .
still have giant sewer roaches .
hoping that happens sooner and will happily pay to get out of my lease .
worst place i 've ever lived !
but i think pinnacle just does n't understand customer service .
once again told close them up in a room for _num_ hours .
and they only work with me when i take my problem to social media .
pinnacle please let me break my lease .
not to mention all the mold that is still there !
i 'm so glad to be done with them because they suck !
once again anyone thinking about this place , run for the hills !
my move in has been awful .
the apartment was not cleaned from the last tenant - absolutely disgusting .
the worst renovation style i have ever seen .
i would not recommend this property .
if i could give this place a zero star i would .
this management company does not deserve your hard earned money .
they could n't be more true .
just do n't rent here .
guess pizza hut lost a couple loyal customers ... .
i have shopped at this bashas for over _num_ years .
he comes back and tells me it 's a max of _num_ .
quite honestly , this grocery store is pretty terrible .
the checkout people are so slow they have to be doing it on purpose .
every time i have gone in there the power chairs have broke down .
i keep asking myself , why do i keep shopping here ?
every time i 'm in here they only have _num_ or _num_ cashiers .
it 's friday night and they have _num_ cashiers .
the lines are at least _num_ people deep each line .
the prices are n't cheaper .
the service is not fast .
at this point i 'm done .
in the last couple months i have had to return defective merchandise from amazon .
sure , i bet that will work considering ups threw away everything .
no thank you .
it was very frustrating .
to say the employees here are rude would be putting it mildly .
i stopped on the way home tonight .
it was dinner hour and pretty empty in the dining room .
we were n't even recognized as we stood waiting for service .
staff is loud , ever see `` king burger '' video ?
mcdonald 's has changed so much over the years it 's hard to recognized .
none of this is unique to this visit .
do they know it 's supposed to be fast food !
maybe under new management they might do better but i do n't know .
slow service with remodeled location .
food was hot and all but the service was eh .
do n't think i 'll stop by again .
this place is awesome the only bad thing about it is management .
this is no way to treat you coworkers .
worst level of customer service ever .
my request .
i did n't know why this was even being explained to me ... .
_num_ hours ... .
going to take ?
so i repeated the request , she rudely said i 'm getting it !
and do n't treat me that way !
and asked for my money back .
rob b .
stupid ass people !
wo n't be coming back.
very disappointing .
this is the 2nd time we have stopped here on our way thru chandler .
was hoping our first was a fluke .
wrong !
this time was worse .
manager yelled at employee for being late in front of customers .
had to repeat our order _num_ times to employee .
it was ridiculous !
this dirty and slow !
`` two regular tacos , no sauce , extra lettuce . ''
the taco was literally soaked in greasy sauce .
_num_ .
for _num_ miles after the first change i 've had an oil leak .
$ _num_ later and a second opinion i 'm good to go .
awful service , and terrible treatment .
that is why i will not return to this specific jiffy lube .
Neutral
however , the negative reviews held true .
he just looked away and walked off .
thought to myself , ok , i 'm out of here then .
this time i was told might be an hour and i was like ok .
my car is still not ready .
why do they call it jiffy lube ?
terrible .
terrible .
terrible .
also they never lock my floor mats back down after vacuuming ?
i 'm too lazy to wash my own car too .
_num_ for `` super '' wash and floor mats but forgot the floor mats .
he said there is no way his guys would overlook dirty doors and dash .
refused a refund , still have to go pick up my mats .
this car wash is mediocre at best .
they did absolutely nothing but tried to bill his insurance for $ _num_ .
the car wash was gets a cut from these guys .
i 've been here twice .
but if you want a good car wash , this ai n't it .
they scratched my car and i thought the interior cleaning was poor .
they seem to rush the car wash process .
service here has went to crap .
it was so rude and the old man was just being nice to me .
i 'm _num_ but i do look like i 'm around _num_ .
this place does n't deserve even _num_ star .
my car was still dirty after and the service was terrible .
who would stick up for an employee that was yelling at another paying customer .
absolutely ridiculous .
i will never be spending my money here again .
they are horrible .
worst detail i 've seen .
now i 'm going to have to spend 30-40 min detailing the car .
got the # _num_ .
let crumbs in plain sight .
did n't use air compressor to get the water out of the side mirrors .
wo n't be going back .
the staff is nice but their work is horrible .
so sad .
he said no problem i 'll fix them .
this car wash has lost mine and my family 's business forever .
i ca n't believe how poor the customer service has gotten throughout the years .
very slow .
way to much money for wait and attention to detail they lack .
_num_ strikes your out !
not really filthy , but dirty at best .
hard to see the cheaper wash options .
this place is now simply horrible .
the owner came back and told the cashier the worker was rude .
the same rude worker did not remove the mats .
what was a good , dependable car wash is now just the opposite .
are they permanently closed ?
i found this sushi to be painfully mediocre .
this is the worst sushi restaurant .
the service is also terrible .
most rolls contain lots of fake crab .
i 'm not a fan .
i do n't understand how this rates so high .
as other reviewers have said , this is not good sushi .
maybe i 'm going at the wrong time ?
the interior is certainly getting old and the carpet is really worn out .
all of which make it less and less attractive .
tonight was my second visit to sakana .
more sushi than i could eat , for _num_ bucks .
tonight i stopped in for cali rolls , unagi , and edamame .
but in the end , the rest of the meal was just ... meh .
i 'm a sucker for spider rolls .
these guys want more eel , she wants it sweeter .
she also had some unagi nigiri .
her comment : not very flavorful .
so maybe we just ordered wrong .
poor quality food , poor service ... big bummer .
i 'm sure there are better places out there for cheaper .
this place is horrible !
service was not very quick but it was friendly .
the sushi was decently priced but seemed uninspired and was not particularly fresh .
not worth the trip in our opinion .
this place is so bad !
such a let down ... chef had zero personality and the food matched .
cheap drinks and appetizers was all that was a positive .
i was so excited to try this place after reading the reviews .
not a good first experience .
the only good thing was the bartender .
every time i 've gone , the servers completely ignore us .
during the first time , it took about _num_ minutes to get a menu .
it was a little busy , but eventually completely died .
after the crowd disappeared , we still got completely ignored .
the service was a bit better .
i could only assume that the other person helping our server was the manager .
i ordered a vodka cranberry instead .
it was awful .
probably no vodka in it .
it was very hard to keep down .
after the 2nd trip , i 've decided not to come back .
it 's awful service , management , and mediocre food .
it 's a bad restaurant in every way .
ridiculous .
the place is overpriced and completely poor quality .
pretty sure they gave us canned tuna and canned crab soaked in mayo .
each bite of sushi here was equivalent of three bites of normal sushi .
unacceptable level of service from start to finish .
the sushi chefs were either rushed , new , or incompetent .
what 's not to like .
probably the very same week .
well ... that was a mistake .
the sushi chef was different though .
i now realize the chef was hiding bad fish with massive amounts of wasabi .
i never went back , nor will i .
if you 'd rather not play the game , go to sushi ken .
i 've eaten at about _num_ sushi joints around here .
this was a very disappointing experience .
i am giving _num_ stars just because it was really cheap .
i ate some bad sushi and regretted it .
i probably wo n't come here again .
i do n't understand the good reviews for this place .
i gave this place two tries .
and this place plays _num_ 's pop music loudly .
worst of all , the sushi was bizarre .
our tofu tempura appetizer came out after the entrees .
did n't add to the experience .
not sure we 'll be back .
wo n't go again .
the food was ok enough but the staff was horrible .
food was ok , but not worth everything else involved .
that 's just me being critical though .
entrees were mostly tempura too .
my boyfriend ordered the chicken teriyaki .
the udon came out second , after around _num_ or _num_ minutes .
then , ten minutes later , came the ramen .
the udon was nearly gone .
i ate most of those before my rainbow roll came out .
throughout the night , there was in total of _num_ waitresses waiting on us .
i had also heard complaints from my group on how dim the lighting was .
extremely poor service .
unfortunately tonight , we had the absolute worst service ever .
save your money on alcohol though they ca n't makes drinks at all here .
i regret that decision .
probably the worst sushi i 've had in the phoenix area .
i am a sashimi guy anyway , and no hiding poor quality there .
the food was n't that great and the sashimi made my wife sick .
only positive thing i can say is it 's reasonable priced .
the quality of the fish was very poor .
obviously once frozen and not fresh .
every thing was just a mushy mess .
it was a really unpleasant atmosphere .
avoid !
the takeout experience recently was not good .
until a year ago , i 'd have given this place ten stars !
this is not an exaggeration .
rude and unprofessional .
recently the quality has suffered .
could n't make heads or tails of that dish awful .
then my daughter had some sort of sushi roll tasteless and disgusting .
there 's no way a real japanese sushi chef would have made this .
goodbye sakana we wo n't come back .
not a fan .
bar is mediocre .
they do n't know how to make a basic mixed drink .
service could be loads better .
not impressed .
tempura roll was not fresh maybe made an hour or two earlier .
unimpressed , wo n't be back .
wo n't come back .
i was so disgusted .
such a bummer because i 've always heard such good things .
had a rather disappointing meal and service experience here last night .
probably wont be coming back to this place .
anyways , very disappointed with my beef teriyaki ... .
we were so disappointed .
we offered to settle up our bill but the management would n't accept it .
they gave us a coupon to try them again at a later time .
Negative
if i could give this a negative review , i would !
i am so disappointed !
the manager apologized for it but this was just gross .
never going back .
the food was great like i remembered but the service was terrible .
we were greatly disappointed and will definitely consider other restaurants over sakana .
the sushi that we ordered was mostly just ok .
why does this place have such good reviews ?
now this is n't always bad , but it 's certainly a red flag .
when we got the spicy tuna roll , it was pale .
that 's not how spicy tuna is supposed to look .
we did n't even touch it because it looked gross .
well _num_ hours later my my coworker and i had food poisoning .
been sick for about _num_ hours ... never going there again .
beware is all i have left to say .
they give you a paper with a list of sushi to choose from .
it was so bland and there was no taste .
it was n't crunchy .
it was cold and soggy .
they only get _num_ stars for the excellent service .
therefore other than that , i will not be returning .
disappointing !
seaweed salad too chewy to eat .
wo n't be returning .
party of _num_ .
we ordered _num_ sushi rolls several drinks and _num_ individual entres .
the vegetables were served last and were burned .
everything that came off the grill was horrible .
they messed up the fried rice , how do you mess up fried rice ?
the rib-eye was extremely fatty , essentially like gum .
it 's the worst of the worst .
Negative
i wish there was a way to put _num_ or negative stars .
server was not attentive and spent all her time in the back .
my first roll came out maybe _num_ minutes later .
i sat there so long i cancelled the lunch plate .
id rather have a mcdonald 's burger than wait for that plate .
worst sushi experience i have ever had and i was a sushi chef myself .
avoid this place at all costs .
never going back .
in the place where pool tables once were , are now teppanyaki grills .
unfortunately , everything was bad .
salad dressing was way too salty .
i did n't want to have miso soup any more after that .
was it sitting in the kitchen long time ?
rice seemed to be old .
an employee greeted me and i said , `` just one , please '' .
he said , `` i 'm ray , the owner '' .
the fish was more mushy than anything .
did n't like it much , wo n't be going there again .
as far as michaels stores go , this place is awful .
i felt gross being here , go to hobby lobby instead .
checkout lines almost always long , staff rarely available to help .
not super clean .
ryan kept rolling his eyes and was very short with me .
either way , he should not be working in anything customer service related .
this is no longer here .
really needed to go and it 's as though it never existed !
walked in and got the crazy eye from the old lady .
why on earth would anyone come to this location ?
i do n't know where to begin with my issues with this establishment .
from the salad bar that needed maintenance to the restrooms .
bathrooms need more regular maintenance as do all of the games .
just about every game has something wrong with it .
service is bad .
i have been here on _num_ occasions .
as some trained and experienced in food service management , it 's appalling .
the worst experience ever .
been there before and the place was ok .
but last night just did it for me and my family to never return .
one the salad bar was worst than other days .
so our salads were all watered down from the water .
the potato salad was so watered down it poured like soup .
never was this told to us at the time of purchase .
so i walked over and told them to stop eating because we were leaving .
peter piper pizza was a way better choice for dinner last night .
even saved me about $ _num_ .
staff was not friendly or attentive .
it 's not worth the wait .
of course what does she bring me , a chicken quesadilla .
not a crappy quesadilla .
not bad at all , but the omelets and pancakes are better at crackers .
the food was okay , the service was terrible .
the mac and cheese looked old .
my corned beef hash looked like it was right out of the can .
i would suggest finding a better option .
not everyone has time to wait around while you take your sweet time !
which is late , but no excuse for bad service !
i have gone to denny 's later and had more cheery people around me .
anyway , so my bro and i get this one young waiter .
ca n't remember his name which is a shame .
so i get my order , and it 's _num_ types of wrong .
the waiter gets mad ... at me ?
confused , i asked where the rest of it was .
i 'm usually not harsh on waiters , they have a hard job .
first and hopefully only time i will never tip a person .
service and food seems to get worse every time .
first of all it seems to have gotten less appetizing all around .
to begin with the service is horrible .
dirty , missing teeth , stained uniforms .
the food here also has gone down hill .
you 're better off at denny 's down the road .
no it was not busy , and no there was not a line .
he only stopped by to clear dishes and drop the bill .
we get that but we deserve to be treated properly .
honestly , this was a complete disappointment .
this was the resort that was chosen after a night out .
_num_ % disappointment .
there appeared to be only two servers working plus one cook .
everyone 's food , once brought out , was cold when delivered .
nonetheless , all cold .
my blt was cold as if it had just come from the refrigerator .
this place needs better staffing and management .
one of the worst breakfast experiences that i have had .
ordered _num_ eggs sunny side up , hashbrowns and sausage .
waffle house would have been a better choice than this ihop .
the location was pretty empty also so being busy is not an excuse .
i guess ihop lost my business i will go to dennys from now on .
so tell me why should i try ihop again ?
we were seated quickly enough , but that was the only plus .
like it was such an inconvenience to her to place such a complex order .
all seven of us did not tip a single cent .
this has been the worst experience we have had at a restaurant .
in the beginning , everything was great and servers joked around .
however , we did not get our orders in until _num_ mins .
very disappointed with this location lately .
if i could , i would give zero stars .
today however the experience was much less than expected .
the coffee ran out and we waited _num_ minutes for a pot !
my vegetable omelette was almost half its usual serving .
Neutral
if i could give a negative star this restaurant would have negative _num_ stars .
this restaurant was horrible !
we showed up at _num_ o'clock tonight and ask for a table .
we had to wait more than _num_ minutes to finally get seated .
if i did n't speak up they would have sat before we did .
the problem is service !
i wish i could give this place _num_ stars .
the breakfast experience started with two coffees and two waters .
i will not be back .
do n't spend your tip all in one place !
does you no good to do a remodel if you ignore your customers .
waitress was too busy ignoring us to take our order .
the booth was n't even clean .
no tip because our waitress was n't attentive in the slightest .
this place is disgusting .
so _num_ month and yet again visited not on a busy night .
no sir no its not .
he also did not care for the beer `` jus '' it came with .
his sweet potato hash side looked overdone and simply not appetizing .
it was a disaster and took forever to prepare .
when i got it the chicken was dry and burnt all on the bottom .
my partner had a burger , it was nothing special .
the good part of that meal were the kettle chips , really !
trying to be upscale but it really doesnt get there .
not bad for lunch specials but overall this place is just average .
while there , our service was terrible .
he acted as if this there was really no reason to be concerned .
he then told me that he would call me back later .
there were no clear cut winners .
the pale ale was better .
this rock bottom is awful .
a poor example of an already poor chain .
dead wrong .
we did n't wait around to find out .
i can appreciate that , so it was n't a big deal .
nearly all of them were unbearable to me .
no real surprise there .
the food started off pretty well .
also , their kettle chips are only okay .
horrible service .
avoid .
i would give this place a _num_ star if i could .
the short rib is salty and overcooked .
the prime rib was tough and half was fat .
my husband and i got horrible food poisoning from this restaurant .
this establishment has no regard for the well being of its patrons .
ok i had to write a review because i was very disappointed !
: ( white ale , red ale , dark ale ?
over all the food sucked and beer sucked .
oh well , just will quit going .
( took about _num_ minutes before he even came to sit us ) .
we had bad service from the get go .
everything is pricey too for being so-so food .
salads are $ _num_ and up .
walking back i noticed the floors were covered in crumbs and food .
the bacon was more like bacon bits and the egg was thin and tasteless .
my friends had ordered a bagel with spread that looked better .
it was about $ _num_ with tax and i left still hungry .
i 've only ever tried breakfast bagel sandwiches .
eggs have no flavor , not even salt and pepper .
customer service could be way better .
bagels are mediocre , nothing special .
very disappointing !
bagels were just ok .
they too thin and there is no crisp outer layer .
the real disappointing part of nosh is that they microwave all their food .
what a ripoff .
it was very disappointing .
my omelet was bland with no seasoning on it .
however , nosh has gone downhill !
the service is terrible .
it took _num_ minutes to get _num_ bagels toasted with cream cheese .
if they do that well , then they forget something else .
the bagels are always cold .
is no longer as good as it used to be .
went on a saturday morning and it was so hot inside it was uncomfortable .
food is mediocre .
we just left today disappointed .
i was craving dairy queen for quite awhile .
it was was so mediocre .
i felt like i was wasting calories for the day .
needless to say i will be calling her management .
so ridiculous .
will not be back here .
the service at this store is deplorable , and here 's why .
why was it so hard to put it back the way it was found ?
big o for sure does n't care about my time or energy .
spent $ _num_ on a radiator for my truck .
after _num_ weeks it failed completely , _num_ months and a week .
this big o is big crap .
you will get screwed !
i also asked to have my tires rotated .
anyway , i 'd rather not go back .
the whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth .
fuck you big o assholes .
they would n't do what a gas station would do .
i had discount tire do it faster with no problems and cheaper as well .
avoid big o tires like the plague .
no thanks , i 'll take my business elsewhere .
no customer service here .
poor service from the minute i walked in the door .
the person helping me was obviously irritated that i was there .
he was rude .
he did n't even tell me .
i left the car no big deal but i wo n't be back .
they never say hello or seem to even want you in the place .
in other words , you get a lot less coffee for the money .
looks like i 'm going back to starbucks !
almost all gates are broken .
no it was n't even done .
i was never given the gate codes to the pool and such .
the pool is brown on bottom and the hot tub does not work .
cant wait till my lease is up .
worst apartment complex i have ever lived in .
first off i paid my rent , a day late .
and they charged me _num_ $ in late fees and did n't tell me .
then someone broke in and stole my stuff .
= $ _num_ .
never got a bad meal there .
ugh , what a waste .
the waiter did n't even check in on us while we were eating .
but if left a bad taste in my mouth .
a restaurant should n't be doing this .
ok but would not choose it over other great restaurants in the area .
poor decision .
apparently getting the food right is not a priority at this place .
if you are in search of awesome mexican food , this is not it .
last night , my pollo asada had a piece of metal in it .
so we finish looking at the menu , sat there for another couple minutes .
but no !
but still nothing .
it started off good when it first opened about _num_ years ago .
i tried to eat the chicken but it was nasty and fatty .
the rice and beans where hot on the outside and cold in the middle .
if you like authentic mexican food , do n't bother .
not really .
this was no freakin ' mouse .
all of my food was room temperature when it came out .
they were each sized like pieces you 'd cut off a steak .
ultimately it was removed from our bill .
sadly , macayo is no longer on my faves list .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the worst part is the chimi was very salty .
bland .
the beans were terrible .
stopped in for dinner tonight and was greeted promptly and seated very quickly .
the chips were fresh but what in the hell happened to the salsa ?
the salsa was absolutely gross and tasteless .
the spicier salsa was brought out and it was n't much better .
instead of tomato paste it tasted like a chipotle bbq sauce .
the lettuce and dressing were pretty good though .
she too said there were some changes to the menu and recipes .
and i think the cheesy dcor is pretty cool , too .
but i just ca n't eat here .
not that this location is particularly bad food or anything .
i just really do n't like macayos .
way too much cheese all over everything .
their chips are like cardboard and the salsa never tastes fresh .
the tortillas are not authentic mexican at all .
for starters , the chips .
boring .
a+ they are flavorful but portion size is down .
you have not had great red enchilada sauce until you 've had this one .
no rice .
sad and not worth the money .
another disappointment .
i think an egg batter a la chile relleno would be an improvement here .
this used to be my regular drop off point after work .
i did n't really get into it .
the old macayo 's was much better .
the rice was super dry as well .
i guess macayos is a crap shoot .
service was so slow !
kinda mushy ... stuff .
wow , food is very blah .
very disappointed in the quality of the food .
sat on the patio ; dirty !
asked the waitress for thier best margarita ; terrible , watered down .
asked for an extra shot of tequila ; watered down !
unbelievable .
just had dinner at this location with my boyfriend .
the food was fine but we were really disappointed with the service .
worst waiter ever !
in sum , it was a real shit show .
disappointed in the service we received this weekend .
i 'm deeply disappointed and wo n't go back any time soon .
i appreciate the response from management but this was a very disappointing meal .
the food - acceptable .
the service - inept from start to finish .
service was very bad .
my wife and i went there last for `` beef taquitos '' .
well , they are not available on the new menu .
no more !
so disappointing .
bland no taste except the basics .
so not sure what was up tonight .
i have not been in forever .
i see why the group does not come here anymore .
service is awful and slow .
food is terrible , generic and tasteless .
they cost $ _num_ for that tiny dessert .
never been so disgusted in my life and will never return .
not enough rice to make a bowl .
the salsa has really gone downhill .
took forever for order then it came to me iced cold .
i ca n't wait for my lease to be up !
many times they do n't wan na open !
i 'm so pissed i always have problems here !
so i 'm pretty much stuck in my apartment complex !
worst place ever !
we will not go back .
the fried batter was just about all there was .
it was too sweet and has a horrible aftertaste .
like the crab rangoon , there is no filling to it .
panda garden - not good !
the portions are very small , even the rice is a very small scoop .
too expensive , poor value !
= not going back !
tip : hot wok mr. cook on warner rd .
been several times before without incident , but no more .
everything we ordered was just ... bad .
the general tso 's chicken was overly breaded , mushy and barely seasoned .
mongolian beef lacked flavor and was a bit of a mess .
fried rice was too oily and lacked flavor .
these dishes lack flavor .
both dishes tasted fried and lacked any real flavors .
even the rice tasted overly wet and tasteless .
waited to long for burnt rice nasty food and it was expensive .
terrible staff , rude .
soggy , greasy , bland food .
this used to be my favorite chinese restaurant close by .
however , the last time i ordered there , the food was horrible .
i email the contact to no response .
never had a problem with staff or food .
maybe more help needs to be hired .
never no apology .
plus service sucked !
very very disgusting !
at _num_ pm it was no customer at all .
now , soup was no taste at all !
it was very bland .
for chicken , it was okay .
it remained me of orange chicken from panda express with some spice .
a bowl of rice she gave me was n't even warm .
not so good food , poor quality , bad service .
i will probably not coming back .
the glasses are _num_ dollars , but at happy hour they 're _num_ .
food ... not spectacular .
the hummus was just not tasty at all .
not my favorite .
yes you can have too much lemongrass .
i do n't know if we 'll go back to visit my wine cellar .
thankfully the music became the highlight of the evening .
my wine cellar is the first stop .
for a minute there i was getting thirsty .
we ordered some roasted brussel sprouts , classic pizza , fries , and hummus .
only thing i dig so far about this place is the ambience .
i really , really wanted to like this place .
again , a really inattentive server .
3rd try - stopped in for a glass of wine in the early evening .
unfortunately the 3rd visit was the worst .
after _num_ full minutes we received our appetizers , our wine glasses empty .
no , she did n't ask if we wanted another glass .
are you kidding me ?
we will not return here .
very unfortunate for us and them .
we got _num_ oz of white wine and one shrimp wrapped in prosciutto .
there was about _num_ oz of steak .
bland , no flavor at all .
the only thing good about it was the lime infused sour cream .
there are other wine bars that do this better such as the living room .
horrible service .
food was ok not the best i would not return for the food .
the manager , samantha , really needs a lesson in customer service .
completely rude !
why ca n't someone make a wine bar that is just regular priced ?
the service was really slow .
they were really understaffed .
the manager lady was incredibly rude to me .
was n't pleased .
i 'm pretty disappointed about updating my review because i love this place .
i probably come every few weeks with either my husband or with a friend .
there is one server in particular that i always get terrible service from .
last saturday was my final straw with the terrible service from him .
the place was n't really busy .
the burger came with cheese and i sent it back .
this place can not handle big crowds and the waitresses never write anything down .
something went wrong here tonight .
$ _num_ for _num_ olives and chicken was borderline jerky .
the wine selection is laughable for a place with wine in the name .
this place makes money charging $ _num_ for a $ _num_ bottle of wine .
pathetic .
i would advise people to stay away from here .
i am so thrilled to be away from there .
_num_ .
paying the high rent that we do , we should feel secure .
i agree with sharon as the water is horrendous .
_num_ .
i pay _num_ $ + for water .
this is not included in rent and i am hardly ever at home .
i can not believe how much water is .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i did n't trust that they would so i stayed with a friend .
_num_ .
it does not feel good and they are everywhere .
so that was disappointing as well .
but tonight was it .
talked to the staff and not much there .
couple weeks ago i was locked out of my apartment .
called the emergency help line _num_ times maybe , left a voicemail every time .
nobody called back , nobody followed up the next day .
just do yourself a favor and avoid this place .
worst example of luxury apartments ever .
and because they are so bad they are way over priced .
i wish you could choose no stars .
but that is not the case .
this has been going on for months and never has a car been towed .
maybe residents should have parking passes so we dont get towed .
maybe the basketball court should close at a decent time so kids can sleep .
customer service at it 's worst .
if it were possible to leave then a _num_ star rating i would .
seriously , it is the worst .
file gets transferred to another leasing agent who is to take over the file .
_num_ .
not to mention anyone can come and go as they please .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
leasing office : staff is rude and next to useless .
customer service is a joke .
also , do n't go by their posted hours for the office .
_num_ .
_num_ .
they just raised parking to $ _num_ a month for all spots .
i did n't realize the land i was parking on was made of gold .
ridiculous fees all around .
it made getting things accomplished very difficult .
plus , the lack of communication regarding the approval process was disappointing .
the restaurant however is a mess .
the restaurant to me looks like it 's been written off .
but the last few visits sure were disappointing .
tables were not clean .
we just went to the _num_ e ray rd location in phoenix az .
although the food was ok , the restaurant was in terrible condition .
fatty gross meat .
but now its really in decline .
high prices , and lower quality .
i was really disappointed with my local baja fresh tonight .
to top that off my salad had old dark colored guacamole and limp lettuce .
i did a surprise visit and what i saw was not what i expected .
so she went only three days a week on the nights i worked .
i would n't recommend sending kids here .
i 'm very unhappy with this location .
the person on the phone was very rude and short .
needless to say i 'll take my business elsewhere .
what a sub-par dining experience !
)
that experience was n't worth the price , though .
but for dinner ... way overpriced , way overrated .
not family friendly at all .
we could not even finish it off .
main course : this is the worse of all the courses .
the chicken and the shrimp also tasted bland .
it really tasted like boiled chicken meat that 's a bit salty .
this is not just the cooking instruction for our table .
why are we paying that much again ?
our server was so slow .
the food , however , was delicious .
but not worth the prices they charge .
unfortunately , this was my first and last visit to the melting pot .
so already this was n't going to be the best experience ever .
skip ahead a week .
this was a terrible experience .
worst !
spend your $ _num_ elsewhere !
really ... that would have been good information when we ordered the turtle fondue .
food was good but service was lacking .
disappointed .
seems like the melting pot should read some of these reviews to make improvements .
shame on me , i guess , for not getting a coupon .
that 's my fault for ignoring the recommendation .
my husband and i went to the ahwatukee establishment using the living social voucher .
this was our very first visit and it may be our last .
our waitress was nice but she was n't attentive and she was quite sloppy .
she also forgot about our champagne , gave us the check and walked away .
and it 's very expensive for only a so-so dining experience .
the service was incredibly slow .
i 'd rather spend $ _num_ at a better restaurant .
please comment and follow me for more reviews !
boy was i wrong .
- the meat is overly seasoned ; coated head to toe with salt .
this will not happen again .
hardly want to go into the gratuity that is included in the price !
ok , whatever .
now , i 'm a little irritated .
this dude was so annoying i just wanted him away from us .
entre was ok , tiny portions and lobster tail was small .
our bill came and gratuity is automatically added ; fine , whatever .
normally , my husband would say no but this time he said hell yes .
for the _num_ of us , we spent $ _num_ .
oh hell ... we wo n't be going back !
or how there was a huge uneven crack in the middle of our table .
he just walked away .
seriously , get over yourself .
it was extremely rude .
our server was extremely personable and courteous the entire evening .
we had the spinach artichoke dip , which honestly was bland .
we love spinach artichoke dips and this was the worst one we 've experienced .
it lacked flavor ; it needed more spices or even some kick with jalapenos .
our meal was n't awful but it was n't amazing either .
without the different dipping sauces the food tastes pretty plain .
so , we spent all last night in and out of the bathroom .
this was supposedly a $ _num_ retail value .
this was very disappointing and i expected better from a national chain .
the cheese course was fine but the salads were small and mediocre .
he later returned with _num_ shrimp and about _num_ bite size portions of beef .
i would have much rather spent it at a nice steak or seafood establishment .
if i wanted to call i would have made my reservation that way .
we sure did n't feel welcome .
one of us , the vegetarian , left disappointed and hungry .
for such a high-end restaurant , they sure do n't treat you that way .
not at this place !
do n't waste your time or money , this place sucks big time .
first off my husband and i went to dinner here on a thursday night .
after our order , our waitress was hardly seen .
it was just as bad when he picked up the pot .
food was mediocre , it lacked flavor even with the dipping sauces .
during our meal a gentlemen who looked like the manager walked by twice .
the service was slow and the restaurant is dated .
the cheese fondue was ok ... .
are you kidding me ?
_num_ hours !
also , how the hell does a fondue place run out of cheese ?
that being said , this restaurant was a very big disappoint to us .
sad to say , i just can not recommend this restaurant .
our waitress taylor was the deal breaker for fun .
it was dark and dated in appearance .
wo n't be back .
food was okay definitely not worth the price and left still hungry .
the last couple times the service has been soooo slow !
the general seating area has nothing in the way of privacy .
i went to the bar and waited _num_ minutes to order one drink .
when we got to the table we waited over _num_ minutes for our server .
i left a _num_ % tip which was pathetic as was the service .
not worth it avoid fondue and the melting pot .
the last couple times the service has been soooo slow !
we went to our table empty handed .
the table situation was another big miss .
she said nothing and ran off into another area of the restaurant .
about ten minutes later , a busser came by to fill our drinks .
our salads were soaking in dressing , which made them really soggy and overpowering .
i was very disappointed .
_num_ ) the restaurant it self needs to be updated .
the ambiance and dcor was similar to that of a black angus .
just not very classy .
tables were pretty small too .
barely any vodka in my $ _num_ drink .
the flavor was so bland and disappointing .
the white chocolate portion was delicious .
_num_ ) my bill , for just me , was $ _num_ before tip !
_num_ ) after all of this , i ended my night on the toilet !
for about $ _num_ a person i expected so much more .
i would not recommend this place to anybody i like .
our recent visit makes me feel i should n't go back .
was celebrating my birthday , the server did n't care .
never poured our wine for us .
really bummed my special day was ruined and we spent good money .
it was very pricey though .
$ _num_ per person for food we had to cook ourselves .
ca n't imagine what the price would have been if they cooked it .
i wo n't be going back .
too expensive .
wo n't bother to go back .
the food was fine , atmosphere normal , drinks were drinks .
well , the new breakfast menu is nothing like that .
puff pastry , eggs , and marinara for breakfast ?
no thank you .
unfortunately , it looks like i will have to find a new breakfast joint .
we were sat and started looking at the menu but realized everything was breakfast .
seriously no lunch until noon ?
this was very disappointing as we were looking forward to giving them a try .
we finally came here for dinner but we were disappointed .
there was n't alot to choose from and it 's quite expensive .
i doubt we 'd be back .
extremely disappointed .
last night , i ordered the catfish on special .
there were no apologies and nothing done to make it right .
last night , they lost a regular customer !
we did n't see our waiter again until he brought out our appetizer .
still no refill .
i flagged our waiter down , and asked for a refill again .
i asked for no onions on my burger , with extra pickles .
i also came with salsa , which was terrible .
overall experience felt cheap , when the bill was quite pricey .
i would not recommend .
our server was lacking friendliness .
was annoyed with our gluten free questions .
this was a restaurant we ate at very frequently .
so because of this manager , we will no longer go back !
but she was barely around to ask .
only because we ca n't give `` _num_ '' stars .
the worst waitress ever .
rather than risk having her spit in our food , we canceled out order .
you 're better off going to boston market across the street .
worst service ever .
i can not over state this .
do n't even care that the food was fine .
we actually turned around and walked out because this place smelled so bad .
all the old people eating lunch here did n't seem to notice .
much to our disappointment , the only thing that 's changed is the sign !
my wife ordered the other special , chicken tortilla soup and a turkey melt .
how could you mess those up , right ?
the french fries however were n't bad though .
i sent my patty melt back to be cooked this time .
just plain ole meat cooked on the flat top .
needless to say i did n't finish it .
but she felt the turkey melt was pretty bland as well .
their food 's just not that good for the price .
they 've now lost our brunch business .
i thought $ _num_ for a beer during happy hour was not reasonable .
no do n't care about points , no !
overall just not a good feel .
jewelry .
shoes .
i saw some purses that were a little better but they were over-priced .
if i could give this a zero rating i would right now .
why are there two separate lines if that is the way it works ?
now it is awful !
this is the 2nd bad experience i 've had here .
this store is dirty and unorganized with horrible selection .
went in yesterday and just had the worse service .
told her twice no just this one bit i 'm ok with credit .
ugh .
i find the food to be uninspired , and below average .
the thing that stunned me was the hostess .
my wife and i went for lunch to celebrate our anniversary .
the menu has changed again and not for the better .
the restaurant was pretty empty .
the server was not friendly at all .
service very slow .
i received a hot plate with cold food .
the crepes were still undercooked and mushy but the inside was hot .
he just dropped it off and went away .
the bad thing about that is you cut down on service too .
usually good but today was terrible .
manager brought out more eggs as we were paying the bill .
they adjusted the check though , so that was nice .
- truly bizarre ... walked in around 9am on a weekday .
the place was virtually empty .
it would have been so much better as an `` edible '' sandwich .
another employee comes over and kicks the dead cockroach to the entry hall .
just disgusting .
management needs to come across a little more sincere too with their apologies .
my waitress was slightly arrogant and the service was awful .
this was my first time visiting mimi 's in ahwatukee for mother 's day .
no hamburger on this menu .
the food was mediocre .
my kids that ordered burgers had a plate full but i had _num_ .
the only bright spot was our waiter who was very attentive .
it really upset me that our mother 's day was so blah .
the windows were filthy , you could not see out them .
i should have known from the parking lot this was gon na be bad .
annoying burnt toast smell the whole time .
avoid .
slow service !
it took _num_ mins to set up a table for me .
guess i do n't need to come here again now .
im not the biggest fan of this store .
after driving _num_ minutes to there i was upset .
milk to be expressed .
that i would wait anywhere between 1-2 hours .
anyways ?
but for when i need something asap , i go there .
i checked out , got home _num_ minutes later and opened the box .
i immediately returned to the store and told them about my damage product .
every other box i looked at has already been opened ! ''
terrible customer service until you get to a manager that actually cares .
dont bother !
the majority of women who work here are very rude .
if you dont want to offer the savings babies r us , then dont !
not the first time myself , sister or mother was treated poorly here .
high prices , poor selection , and awful customer service .
i was stuck with products i did n't need .
i was disgusted and offended .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
it makes me feel like a criminal or something .
_num_ .
very poor customer service .
they make you feel like your in the wrong .
you told me it was no longer valid .
you refused .
are you aware of what lousy customer service that is ?
are you aware of false advertising ?
are you aware that you lost a customer instead of created a customer ?
or even let me have the sandwich at $ _num_ ( ps .
well , you are .
they act as clueless as you .
the service is atrocious .
not rude , but not really all there .
they sliced the other bagel in the bag , though .
seems like the management and service needs to get it together .
seriously ?
no cinnamon raisin not even plain ?
quality gets worse every week - now they do n't even make enough .
annoying .
these were not tiny lap dogs or service dogs .
if i could give this location no stars i would .
she does not have the personality or patience to be customer facing .
the employees are rude and every single visit has been terrible !
wow , unprofessional and extremely poor customer service !
people around me were blown away by the `` mean girl '' performance !
do n't reward businesses that treat their customers so poorly !
no acknowledgement of any of it .
two stars because the margaritas were tasty .
the food was horrible .
shame on me for going to a chain mexican restaurant in arizona .
then , she ended up not even ordering a margarita !
they were not very good .
ate here several times and the only decent food is the rice .
the redeeming factor of this restaurant is its patio .
it did n't look too busy .
after about _num_ minutes we left .
kudos for the hostesses who were very apologetic .
i was pretty disappointed this time around .
the waitress was a bit of a pain .
nothing special would skip it .
i guess they changed the menu , the food was marginal .
do n't get the shrimp tacos !
this restaurant is off my list for good .
the rice was just as bad .
the only thing i found appealing were the re fried beans .
last time there was a dirty folded receipt in the chips .
by far one of the worst meals i 've had .
the service is terrible .
i 'd give this _num_ star in terms of food .
the service , chips and salsa were fine then it all went south .
it was pretty awful .
service was extremely slow for starters and the chips were cold and overly salted .
i understand that sometimes sh*t happens , but this was ridiculous and disgusting .
i was quite turned off to the whole experience at this point .
she apologized and was quite embarrassed by the whole situation .
about _num_ minutes later i had a new plate .
the cheese crisp was semi cold and soggy .
i will no longer be dining here .
Negative
if negative were a rating , i would give them just that .
i have been to this place _num_ time to say it basically sucks .
the food is horrible and so is the service .
we ordered the sampler and i hated it and my daughter got sick !
i immediately remembered why i did n't want to go back !
horrible service .
also ordered a side of sour cream .
overall food was average , bland chain mexican food .
will not be back .
too many other fine mexican restaurants in the area .
horrible visit .
but they obviously do n't train their bartenders correctly .
ordered a _num_ sauce chicken burrito without onions and peppers .
_num_ minutes later i get my lunch prepared incorrectly .
i ca n't eat onions and peppers .
no manage apology .
not real busy .
there might be a problem .
my food came and no drink ... .
no one has been back to my table since my food got here ... .
what a shame !
probably wo n't return anytime soon .
prices too high , service too low .
i ordered a chicken taco ( crispy ) and a spinach and mushroom enchilada .
they added their corn in the enchilada .
ca n't decide if i 'll give this another shot or not .
this is not good mexican food .
my _num_ tacos could have made up _num_ whole taco .
my family and i will not be back .
i ordered a chicken taco ( crispy ) and a spinach and mushroom enchilada .
they added their corn in the enchilada .
ca n't decide if i 'll give this another shot or not .
the burritos here look like taquitos , small and skinny , with open ends .
really slow at the bar for happy hour .
the chicken had a terrible flavor as did the beef .
there are literally no options .
it was just a tortilla stuffed with veggies .
there was no rice and beans were on the side .
i will never visit this place .
but it has definitely gone downhill .
different locations of course .
food pretty good but service was so bad .
the salsa especially was so bland and tasteless .
never will go back .
waitress was prompt in getting our drinks and taking our order .
even asked to make sure the beans did not get cheese sprinkled on it .
after that it went downhill .
told the guy she could not eat cheese .
she made a comment that she had put the order in .
she never came back to check on us after that .
we tried to wave her down several times but she did not see us .
i gave up on drinks and tried to eat the bland jalapeo poppers .
i could have paid half as much for a better meal at rubio 's .
the food is disgusting .
the tamales sucked !
the skirt steak was undercooked and made the partner sick .
alcohol could n't even make it better .
extremely mediocre mexican food .
service always slow .
been to _num_ different locations .
chips were n't fully fried .
but whatever .
my love for on the border is no more .
ordered online , came within _num_ minutes so that was nice .
but what i paid $ _num_ is absolutely pathetic .
tiny little bowl that is barely a snack .
barely any beans or rice .
on my last trip to this location i had a fairly typical experience .
service at this location seems to be a frequent issue .
again service for bread drinks and the check was slow .
things took a turn for the worse .
uh , ok.
looks like a macaroni grill is not a macaroni grill .
this one did n't impress me .
it was n't inedible , but it really was n't very enjoyable either .
it 's hard to ruin pasta .
finally , we went on a saturday for dinner and it was insanely crowded .
horrible service at this location .
only one small problem .
you could get a lot nicer salad at a sit-down restaurant for less money .
the hot food , as some other reviewers have mentioned , is pretty sub-par .
but why is the door so close to the salad bar ?
that 's ridiculous .
not worth the money .
i was excited they had gluten-free options but hoped for more than _num_ soup .
every time we have ever been here , they have had clam chowder .
been another _num_ minutes and that guy has n't come over yet .
this place is not clean .
_num_ dollars for shit for food .
only location i like in the east valley is the one in gilbert .
i do n't know why i allow my husband to drag me here .
however nothing ever looks appetizing .
sadly , not true .
_num_ pasta , some flat breads and a chili bar .
selections do n't seem to change much .
i get disappointed because there are not healthier selections here .
this place is full of incompetent barbers .
i recently went to joe 's for a haircut .
the wait was long but stuck it out .
apparently , good only for kids and those keeping hair under _num_ '' .
i wear my hair long .
it seems they are getting worse and worse .
dennis asked me some questions and quoted me prices - very straight forward .
Positive
check out all the negative google reviews on this place .
that to me is really shady .
had terrible experiences with this place 20+ years ago that i 've never forgotten .
i tried to put it on and it was now too small .
given my prior experience , however , i tend to doubt it .
i would n't do business there if they had a _num_ % off sale .
the gold would probably turn out to be just plated .
are you kidding me ?
worst gel manicure i 've ever received .
not coming here again .
i had n't even mentioned my experience .
we chose to get a manicure as well and i immediately regretted it .
the reviews on here made it seem so legit but instead it was mediocre .
another woman there was having a worse time .
however my last visit has officially sealed the deal .
doing .
the 2nd time i just wanted a regular manicure and it was awful .
terrible customer service store !
went in and no one even acknowledged me .
taken my daughter to this office a few times , but wo n't anymore .
i would not recommend anyone to this place .
i would not recommend !
but again , no other kids besides mine ... many empty chairs .
so that was it ... and we walked out !
just lost two more patients and i will not recommend .
wtf !
i really ca n't say anything , to be honest .
nothing to write home about .
prices were nice and cheap .
it was n't spiced as much as i thought it would be .
this had too much of a fast food feel for my taste .
nothing special .
drove _num_ miles to check it out because of the tv show .
was n't worth it .
i am a mexican food snob but , no one was really a fan .
they were fine but absolutely nothing special whatsoever .
this place was featured on diners and dives , so we had high expectations .
we had _num_ types of tacos and a shrimp burrito .
the lengua was alright but the pieces were too big .
the shrimp burrito had very few small shrimp in it .
the cash and messed my order up .
although good , i guess they were n't spectacular enough to bring me back .
i arrived at the restaurant estimated ready time stated during our phone order .
my destination is _num_ minutes from this location .
the beans are all cold .
that 's _num_ strikes on the same order , though .
unfortunately they could not even meet that standard this time .
spend your money somewhere where it will be appreciated .
whether , chinese , mexican , greek .
it was n't the cleanest place either .
there is no waiter service .
prices were quite reasonable .
i 'm not sure if we will return or not .
sadly i wo n't be going back .
they were super dry , no flavor , very little meat .
just plain gross .
i ordered the hard shell carne asada tacos , they were awful .
they tasted like rubber just very bland .
well , i 'm gon na be honest .
the food is bad .
sauces taste nasty .
meat is not the freshest .
the prices are ridiculous .
would not recommend .
i took it up and showed the cashier girl .
inconsistent food , dirty environment , rude staff and not a positive experience .
try burrito company instead .
the food is good , but the service is terribly slow .
_num_ minutes for six tacos is ridiculous .
and it 's not very busy to wait so long for tacos .
there were maybe _num_ people in the place when it fits like _num_ .
so it was half full ... .
terrible service !
food is still great since they remodeled , but the service is currently lacking .
the 1/2 dozen other customers were all waiting same time .
the meat essentially had no flavor at all .
i left very disappointed , and without any desire to return .
this place feels like a fast food place to me , not a restaurant .
$ _num_ bucks is too much for fast food imo .
for me , prices get a thumbs down .
my burrito had hardly any beans and a ridiculous amount of fried egg whites .
i was wrong .
it was disgusting in flavor and texture .
taco bell has better bean and cheese burritos .
disgusting .
so unless their food changed with the renovation , this review will be helpful .
this is not truly good , authentic mexican food .
it 's not gross or anything , but it 's definitely nothing special .
however , thumbs up for customer service .

however , thumbs up for customer service .
this place was kind of dry and not a great selection of salsa .
the biggest disappointment was the music selection .
it was terrible and not family friendly music .
many other places that are better , not worth the extra drive .
i ca n't imagine coming back .
i go pick them up and not one person smiled at me .
there was one other customer and she got no smiles either .
do n't go on taco tuesday .
stood in line for _num_ minutes and then waited _num_ minutes for our order .
with that being said - the food quality has gone way downhill .
it 's flat out terrible actually .
poor , hard , dry chicken .
i would n't serve those beans to my dog .
they must have no clue what mexican food is .
unfortunately the increased size has increased the wait .
is not worth it .
this was my 1st time trying this place out .
salsas are less than o.k .
carne asada was dry , shrimp did n't have any flavor at all .
need i say , i called to order for pick up .
no sincere apology whatsoever , really crappy service overall .
really disappointed with the service .
.
but service was bad .
it was my first time here & i was ordering for my office .
this place sucks .
broke ass mexican food at hipster prices .
they charge $ _num_ for a fountain drink and use styrofoam cups ... wtf .
basically , f this place .
if i could give this zero stars i would .
when the food finally arrived , two of our three orders were wrong .
no free chips and salsa like every other mexican restaurant on the planet .
_num_ stars for service , but food tasted good , so _num_ stars .
took over _num_ minutes to get our order .
_num_ orders past our number , i inquired if our food was ready .
after talking to the back , they said _num_ more min with no apology .
so we went to los taquitos the other night , and were quite disappointed .
they switched their menudo so that it 's only available on the weekends .
they also had stopped serving breakfast for some reason .
i 've been a customer for _num_ years , and may never return .
thanks a lot .
the manager was not friendly ( never smiles .
and the staff is somewhat inept , if friendly .
something was wrong with his front leg .
i just relocated from los angeles _num_ weeks ago .
this is where the experience started that left a bad taste in my mouth .
first impressions mean everything .
when i called they treated me like crap and did n't even care .
i came here because of a groupon or a living social deal .
i dropped off my dog first thing in the morning when they opened .
i boarded him for _num_ days .
i did n't like the vibe of the place .
i 'm gon na have to pass on this place based on my experience .
questionable !
i was not sure if the dogs have a big yard to run around .
one unhappy client is _num_ unhappy clients .
so sorry that kim was not there for my baby .
a no-frills , no charm grease spoon .
i ordered the italian beef sandwich , she an artichoke chicken pita sandwich .
first , the meat in my italian beef was bland , really bland .
now , my girlfriend is n't the hearty eater that i am .
for her to say those things , it 's bad .
the pitas are soggy and so are the fries .
i really liked this place and am disappointed in the changes .
thinking he would take my tray i said yes .
i tried the chicken gyro which left a lot to be desired .
had two pieces of tomato very few onions and some tzatziki sauce .
i guess that i should have gotten my expectations in order before going in .
the chicken was dry & tasted weird .
for example i had the greek salad with grilled chicken .
we ordered a gyro and a chicago hot dog .
both were horrible .
the gyro was skimpy , cold , the pita was stale and tasteless .
the hot dog was also small and not really made like a chicago dog .
i would give this restaurant a zero , if that was an option .
they wanted to close up early , so they screwed the customer , me .
this place is horrible .
no one ever apologized either time and said they were running behind or anything .
service here is just unacceptable .
wrong .
when i had them transferred to my new dentist ( dr .
they could not even make any of them out .
really - how exactly does one use a pool vacuum too much ?
i made several attempts to correct service but no changes made .
i talked to the service manager and even the owner .
i wish i could give this place less than one star .
it was easily the worst experience of my life !
it was very posh .
i just wish they had used the money for that to hire better stylists .
she still should have just told me no .
i may be a lot of things but i am not a liar .
the salesman was nice and did n't provide too much pressure .
i placed a small down payment to reserve my item .
i called _num_ days later and was informed the item was now available .
small problem , the table and chairs are not at this location .
the salesman was extremely helpful and offered us all of these great deals .
that salesman we liked has a difficult time returning phone calls now too .
i told them this is a very poor way to do business .
signed sad but will take my sale elsewhere .
i was so shocked i did n't know what to say and just left .
it was apparent that commission was driving factor , not customer service .
nails all over in places that nails should not have been .
the second sofa was again made very sloppy .
i told him , look , i just gave you more money !
they have my money i did not put the furniture on credit .
i did not put it on lay away .
than i was told martin the manager said no .
i will never again buy at the room store .
i 'm planning on contacting the attorney general and bbb .
that 's not the real issue though .
still no call back from him .
i 'm about ready to return it .
it 's not comfortable , especially not $ _num_ comfortable .
i will never shop there again and neither will my family .
seriously what is it with furniture salesmen , they 're just like car salesmen !
against my better judgement we went to look in the room store .
i really hate furniture shopping at these types of stores .
so after about _num_ minutes we were done .
is n't that classy ?
nothing like having company over .
they apparently have no desire to do so .
however i am no longer a satisfied customer with them .
_num_ weeks later , still nothing .
i really hate the way we have been treated .
i would have rated them with no stars if that was an option .
they could n't even get that right .
zero stars are what this company deserves .
customer service does n't exist here .
one week after the warranty expired the leather started splitting .
no one even sits on that side of the couch !
they wo n't fix it and now it 's virtually worthless .
i 'm sorry i ever walked into that store and never will again .
dont buy from them as obviously they are down to only a few stores .
this probably is n't even real leather .
so sad cuz this was a gift - an expensive one .
zero stars .
this review is not for the furniture , it 's for the service .
chairs were cancelled , no problem .
he said he could n't return it without the manager there .
we will not be back .
so glad this place is going under .
they were quite pricy so it never entered my mind that they were n't .
only about _num_ % of the couch is leather .
nothing but cheap plastic and vinyl junk !
not worth a 1/3 of what we paid for .
they do n't even deserve _num_ star .
i do n't even want to rate _num_ star .
pedicure lasted _num_ week .
i ca n't tell if it was a bad application or cheap products ?
worst pedicure i 've had .
ample enough time to do a mani/pedi .
there was nothing relaxing about this experience .
i 've been wearing acrylic nails off and on for the past _num_ years .
i am not going back .
this was a horrible experience .
glad money was spent getting new name tags instead of more tellers .
unfortunately , i have to come here because my job banks with you guys .
terrible !
i dread going into this bank .
last time i was there , i needed to get a debit card replaced .
the `` greeter '' said that the wait was _num_ hour and _num_ minutes !
do n't go here unless you 're expected to be treated rudely .
this place is awful .
Very negative
if i could give negative stars i would .
it was freezing cold .
awful experience with this doctor 's office every single time .
the reception staff is rude and unfriendly .
i 've since changed doctor 's and will never visit this place ever again .
they make it extremely difficult to be a patient of theirs !
i do n't like writing bad reviews but this is just crazy .
this has been going on for a year and a half .
this is the absolute worst experience i have ever had working with any company .
i 've tried to reach my doctor or her medical assistant for two days .
i 'm very disappointed with the front desk staff at this office .
i 'm a really low maintenance client .
i couldnt believe my ears .
all of it lost .
talk about a disaster .
yuck , really ?
purchased a computer - spent extra money to have dropped shipped in two days .
absolutely the worst customer service from the geek squad .
terrible customer service !
stay away and spend your money elsewhere !
never thought it would be so hard to spend money in a best buy .
we could n't find an employee to help us with an appliance .
it took _num_ minutes to get someone to help us .
was in the store for _num_ minutes .
then he approached me and said she was n't talking to you .
i did not want that phone again .
he also ask why i did not buy my phone from them .
the geek squad people are even worse .
this is not a lost cause .
you guessed it : same ear buds for $ _num_ less !
customer service here is really odd .
she said no ... and just walked away .
ah , well .
i stopped by this location closest to me to pick up a microwave .
we used our reward points to get $ _num_ off .
seriously worst service i had ever received anywhere when returning an item .
the laptop was a bit slower than in the store .
the hardest error to get off a computer !
either way , not cool .
i suggest going to the chandler mall location .
they told me , if i got the service plan , would cover everything .
found it , it does not .
just do n't you computer repaired at best buy .
i then visited your store at approximately 11am on wednesday , march 30th .
my feet were left rough and polish was sloppy .
the polish for my manicure was bubbly and not cleaned from my cuticles .
place looked average clean .
i decided not to get nails done there and probably will not go back .
i do n't get my nails done a lot .
ca n't remember the last time i had a manicure .
i had a holiday party and realized that i really needed one .
if i had known that , i would have asked for them .
i will not be going back .
worst place i 've never been to .
nails are filled horribly .
Negative
i give them negative five stars .
extremely rude staff , poor quality job .
no need for the rude attitude .
they refused .
flat out rude and very poor quality that they will not back up .
the guy was arrogant .
wo n't be going back .
oh , and i 'm still peeling product off my skin .
the pedicure was below average .
i will not be returning nor will i refer anyone here .
simply disgusted .
the massage was terrible , basically rubbed in some lotion .
i should 've walked then !
do n't waste your time here .
kids screaming , ruining up and down the hallways .
rooms were filthy , sheets were disgusting , towels not clean .
do not stay here .
ridiculous .
i was very angry .
i am never staying here again .
she gave me attitude whenever i requested fresh linen .
this was not a stay away from home for me.
me and my wife will never be staying at an extended stay america again .
this place is a joke and i will never stay here again .
who cares that i am freezing cold i guess .
this is the worst place i have ever stayed at .
not to mention for an extended stay - no hair dryer .
seriously what hotel does n't provide hair dryers anymore .
also , it is very very loud .
it was actually very hard to sleep .
it was horrible .
checked in late in the evening and housekeeping had plenty of time to clean .
no amenities left at all not even a small bar soap !
no breakfast served because the food never arrived !
the front of refrigerator was dirty with stuck food .
dirty sticky kitchen area counters .
the room was definitely not cleaned .
she said those rooms would just not be available to book until monday .
terrible management .
reservations apparently mean nothing here .
front desk staff is clueless .
avoid .
never ever stay or use the phoenix and surrounding area locations .
the hotel room itself is beyond disgusting carpets and floors are filthy .
if i could give it less than i would .
woke up to a roach watching me nap .
worst hotel i have stayed in by far .
i literally just walked out of this store and was so disappointed .
he did n't even look up from his computer .
my have they changed .
no eye contact no hello .
i would n't even trust them to care for a pet rock .
totally disgusted !
absolute worst customer service at this store .
could n't find bath bubbles to save my life !
and also could n't find an employee to save my life .
the customer service counter is a joke !
i purchased a few items and went to checkout .
i got my receipt and sure enough she left off one of the coupons .
i gave the clerk ( unknown name ) a fifty dollar bill .
she did not give me the proper change .
she gave me the change without any apology .
worst service here !
when i get here i look around and am not seeing this toy anywhere .
so i walk down there and it 's no where to be found .
nothing happens , so i hit it again , still nothing .
just come here for dropping off packages !
the manager does not know anything about computers .
she needs to take a beginner course in computer _num_ .
this is not the first time .
i told her , i know .
after _num_ mins explaining , then i said fedex .
they over charge and the manager does n't know about simple technology .
i would not even tell my worst enemy to shop here .
i am so stupid .
do not go to this office unless you want to be ripped off .
the doctor is trying to just find work to do and charge the insurance .
they are still calling me to schedule an appointments for my teeth fillings .
ever since they worked on my teeth i 've been in pain .
i wish i would have never went here .
i thought the whole point of taco bell is its open late .
not 11pm , or a few minutes before .
i guess this is the deal for you .
well got sauce for breadsticks it was cold , bummer .
the pizza was also cold , seemed old .
no pepperoni ?
no one has gloves on !
but this place is just not worth the money .
lots of mud and the fairways are in very very bad shape .
as i remember one of my colleague told me a must play course .
flat and pretty much surrounded my houses .
they would not honor the coupon that were given to them .
all in all just a very run down facility .
well this just confirmed by belief .
full minute goes by before either acknowledge a new customer has walked in .
i scheduled an oil change over a week ago .
showed up for my appointment and they did n't have me on the schedule .
really poor customer service .
pretty lame subs and sandwiches .
hate to say it , but subway is much better .
service was okay but nothing to yelp positively about .
sadly , they both were not good .
i 'm not coming back .
had a hot sub , was heated up in a microwave .
fountain drink stand has dust on it , bad sign .
_num_ , maybe _num_ seconds ?
sanitation on that situation = _num_ .
my chips taste terrible .
not crunchy at all .
i 'm just never coming back again .
sub factory was a total waste of my money and time .
not so clean , both the facility and the workers .
excuse me ?
i will not be giving jo ann fabrics any of my business .
whenever we 've gone there , there 's rarely anyone to help you .
the lady at the cutting table always seems overwhelmed , too .
the checkout line is long and atrocious .
i 've taken several sewing classes and buy fabric here all the time .
she walks off and never came back !
i stood there for almost _num_ minutes before i got sick and left .
i make decisions to not come here because the lines are so ridiculous .
slow slow slow !
however , this store is poorly maintained .
been standing in the checkout line for over _num_ min .
ridiculous !
rude and dismissive .
are you kidding me ?
i left without buying anything .
if i could have rated this store less i would have .
this has been the worst customer service environment i have ever had !
a ridiculous waste of my time and overall horrible customer service .
oh , and by the way , the floral section was near empty .
horribly long lines to check out .
i just needed to buy one thing for my halloween costume .
only _num_ people at checkout on a sunday , weak !
too bad no stars is n't an option .
avoid if you can !
they only have their own interest in mind , not yours .
not impressed .
for some reason i was unable to prompt the machine to leave a message .
the woman was extremely rude .
just as the previous review stated `` no attention to customers '' .
does n't matter anymore , they lost a customer .
i did n't say anything because i assume that professionals know their job .
i returned the next day to try and get it fixed .
needless to say i was very dissatisfied .
ive gone here about eight times over a year .
i 've probably left after showing at least that many times .
could n't say enough about how nice these two are .
not a tour !
she did n't even bat an eye about it .
this place has gone downhill so so fast .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
some noise is to be expected in apartment life but its absurd here .
_num_ .
they are terrible customer service people .
_num_ .
the last two were awful .
friendly enough , but i will not go back .
no apologies , not even a courtesy call to let me know ?
disappointing .
terrible haircut .
she took only about _num_ minutes to cut my hair and it looked uneven .
i would never pay any amount to get my hair cut there again .
luckily i am on medical leave and do n't have to leave my house .
it is typically bands just starting out , not established valley bands .
this is a decent place to grab a beer and watch a ball game .
a cover charge ?
to see a crappy band ?
this place was horrible for a last minute drink .
the guinness was properly poured but not served in a traditional pint glass .
hard to taste the beef through all the seasoning though .
jack 's is probably a good neighborhood drinking hole .
do n't expect anything more than cold beer and casual atmosphere .
rude service , cold food , watered down drinks .
if washed up covers are your thing , this is your place .
i wish i could give minus stars .
there was attitude in the conversation that was not appropriate .
i became defensive and upset , demanding to know where she found this information .
i 've never received a call back .
i am disappointed and completely appalled by the behavior of this office .
they do n't care .
i do n't get the good reviews for this place .
she just missed out on so many things .
she did n't miss charging me , though .
i was afraid she might attack , which has never been a concern .
never again will i go this vet .
only down side is they are very very expensive compared to other vets .
do n't fee bad to say no , i do n't want that .
initial drink service was slow .
we had a party of _num_ and the service was terrible .
and the food was not good , either .
but i suppose the old folks that come here are n't exactly picky .
which would have been saved had the food been good .
sadly , no .
skip that bread too .
it 's soggy and stale .
good location , average food , but too expensive .
drink service is slow .
good location , average food , but too expensive .
drink service is slow .
just dined there this evening , and we were fairly disappointed .
overpriced , and not a good experience .
this place is too pricey for the quality and size of their food .
_num_ different prices for the same brand of beer .
if you really have a choice , go to garage across the street .
mozzarella cheese sticks average to good .
pasta bland sauce also .
vegetables first time accompanied that dish not tasty .
wife ordered the worst eggplant she ever tasted .
all totaled a total waste of money $ _num_ plus $ _num_ tip .
i 'd rather pay more for perfect than save a little money for average .
bland american style is how i sum up the food .
not an enjoyable dinner _num_ 1/2 stars .
the place was packed though our table was ready as per our reservation .
this is an italian restaurant , where 's the ambiance ?
oh ... but it gets better .
gross !
the wine was just ok , and the oysters rockefeller were the worst ever .
there were _num_ , and they were tiny and pathetic looking .
we just should have walked out and said `` really ? ''
i even left a tip , that 's how stupid i am .
$ _num_ for what ?
felt ripped off and very disappointed .
it 's changed hands long since and is not even comparable anymore .
no presentation at all ?
_num_ .
do you not know what oysters rockefeller are ?
call them baked oysters , or something , but not rockefeller , c'mon .
giving _num_ star only because you have to chose at least _num_ .
Negative
otherwise , it 's a negative number .
skip it and go somewhere else .
the service was bad .
for the prices they charge i expect more .
i 'm wondering if the others have had good italian food before .
the wine i picked was good and then it went downhill from there .
i ordered the linguini pasta with clams in a garlic sauce .
the noodles were not good and the sauce was tasteless .
waitress brought me a replacement dish and did not charge me for it .
they get _num_ stars for their effort but two for their cuisine .
after being there awhile we finally we had somebody get our drinks .
however they never came back around to fill our drinks .
i filled my own cup several times till the pitcher was empty .
however we had to ask _num_ times for bread after waiting _num_ minutes .
the customer service sucked .
i 'm glad i did n't spend my money at this place .
however i wo n't be going back any more .
no warm greeting for us !
he finally offered another location but stated it would be just as bad .
the next thing you realize there is no friendly greeter .
still waiting even longer , the waiter finally returned to take our orders .
i took my first bite an the meal was barely warm .
i have n't been to a wendy 's in a very long time .
ugh .
the fries must have been sitting around for a while .
they were n't very hot and were pretty soft .
not sure i have a reason to go back again after this experience .
i had a long wait time just to receive the wrong order .
instead i got two asiago chicken combos and one spicy chicken with no cheese .
only the drinks were correct .
not to mention their prices are now comparable to better quality fast food places .
fool me once shame on me but never again .
i wish i could give no stars .
never , and i mean never is my order done correctly .
kind of bland , a little pricey .
good for out here i guess , but not really that good .
nello 's you really let me down .
not even an apology and a $ _num_ gift card .
very bland , poor tasting pizza !
does not live up to the hype !
this was the first and probably last visit to nellos .
this pizza does not live up to all the hype here on yelp .
the crust was thick , chewy and tasteless .
it was a very bad product .
i really do n't understand the pizza market in phoenix .
this pizza does not even compare to a good pizza .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
may come back may not .
the bottled beer was $ _num_ also sadly not impressed .
guys , i 'm not sure what the heck i 'm missing here .
i 've tried two pizzas here : the bbq chicken and the vegetarian .
i walked out , plain and simple .
after _num_ hours i asked for the check and i 'm gone .
stopped in after a hard day , and got a pizza to go .
asked my wife how hers was , she said eh .
as i recall , it was much better .
noticed alot of people got various toppings , i did n't .
no kidding !
well , it was the worst pizza i 've ever eaten .
totally flavorless .
i hate wasting money on bad food !
i could n't stop laughing , it was so bizarre .
it 's a shame , too because the ingredients were on point .
i have been going to boston market for years .
so tonight i returned .
i guess the consistency has remained , but the quality is lost .
i had to ask for my money back and left with no salad .
the manager - dan did n't really seem to care .
i will not return to this store until its management changes .
over the years i have been there dozens of times .
now it has fallen below the minimal acceptable standard .
horribly slow service !
food is nothing to rave about .
when i arrived the line had only one person that was being helped .
i could not believe how small the chickens are now .
bad business !
the quality of food is no longer there .
decided to try them again since el pollo loco was not open yet .
now i remember why we stopped coming .
the sides were not fresh but maybe because we were there early evening .
it was very clean but pretty empty .
i 'm not sure if it 's any better , it 's just different .
that 's about what i expected , but i 'm still pissed .
`` for all life is precious nor can any be replaced . ''
this store lost a customer .
secondly , their crust is the wonder bread equivalent of pizza dough .
its mediocre at the very best .
additionally the service was rather shoddy and imho rather racist .
the lighting was too dim for a raw meat food joint .
gave ra two chances .
still do not like the atmosphere , nor the food .
was terrible .
total waste of money .
mom did n't like the soup , as well .
the low prices are n't enough to get me to return , however .
i 've been to ra a few times in arizona and california .
as for the sushi , it does n't stand out at all .
maybe the music made it so i could n't taste my food .
the loud rock music and night club atmosphere was a little too much .
a little disappointed .
if you want sushi , there are better places nearby .
if you want to go out and party , there are better places nearby .
bad idea .
our server appeared shortly after we were sat .
i did n't try it so i ca n't say much else about it .
for dessert , we ordered the banana maki .
really the sushi is not gon na blow any minds anytime soon .
ra is the worst place to go for sushi .
do n't eat there .
prices are a little steep considering they serve 2nd rate sushi .
the hostess was terrible - not inviting at all !
- but our waitress was awesome .
it 's hard to screw up miso soup , edamame and veggie rolls .
but the veggie tempura was terrible !
it 's chain , keep your expectations low .
we were seated and ordered our drinks and all was well .
they never take that long and it was just unacceptable .
their rolls are pretty mediocre anyway .
its just not happening .
the sushi was n't very fresh at all .
the service was absolutely terrible and the food was mediocre at best .
a pricy place to grab a bite .
the noise volume absolutely smothered the meal and destroyed the atmosphere for me .
i 'm updating my review ... because ... well , this is just disappointing .
cheap sake , cheap beers , cheap sushi .
the sushi is made in the same process as going to a subway .
would i recommend the sushi ?
but i would recommend the sushi if you want cheap eats .
the service was horrible .
our waitress was too busy talking with the hostess to bring our drinks .
on top of the horrible service , she got tried to overcharge us .
and the worst of all they had a dj with super loud music .
it was just annoying .
the service could be so much better .
disappointing !
way over priced for less than average sushi .
some of the combos are just gross !
for a $ _num_ tab , i was hoping for at least average !
mediocre food and poor service .
i wo n't be back .
sometimes , i 've had it look like a disaster during happy hour .
whenever i see little kids eating here , i question their parents ' decisions .
food is barely average and going down hill fast .
gross .
the service was not good .
our drinks were left empty for most of the meal .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
take your money and support the small local businesses around town !
she had long , black hair and she seemed to hate me .
talk about bad service .
this place has awful service .
awful , horrible , terrible service .
corporate recently decided to stop their happy hour on saturdays .
she was so rude about it .
but after that experience i do n't think i could ever go back .
why is the service always so bad here ?
slow , inattentive and very lax .
in once instance , it was a _num_ cent discount .
the seaweed salad was pretty tasty but the rest was just average .
empty drinks , empty plates , long waits for food etc .
when i asked the price she said $ _num_ .
downhill !
i figured , okay it was a bad night .
what really got me angry ?
totally ignored us .
used to come here all the time and never had bad service until today .
the hostess was less than friendly and so was our server .
what a joke at ray road .
this place is mediocre at best .
i am always weary of eating sushi far from the coast .
the nigiri and rainbow roll was just ok .
the fish was n't the most flavorful .
the spicy tuna roll was just bad .
it was n't real spicy tuna !
my husband said they were n't bad .
everything else i mentioned was safe for me to eat .
i feel like they could have offered more discount or deals .
however , i wo n't be back .
it tasted like the lime sour mix they put in it .
then she disappeared again for _num_ mins .
we sat down and waited about _num_ mins before we seen the bartender .
our food was extremely slow to come out and there was hardly anyone there .
however , these past few weeks have really gone down hill .
this place has really continued to go downhill over the past few years .
immediately i felt like i had just sliced my lip open .
tonight was the first time i came to this restaurant .
the waitress we had was not attentive at all .
when i got my drink i did not taste any pomegranate .
all i tasted was squeezed lime .
for the money we spent there i expected better service .
if it was n't for the bad service i would probably go back .
her response ?
it was n't very busy .
the service was n't very good .
the short rib appetizers were bland and very fatty .
the vegetable roll was very bland as well .
bad drinks , bad food , bad service .
grossly overpriced for what we received and service was mediocre at best .
it 's not worth the time for over price sushi !
tonight , we called ahead for party of _num_ .
you guys wo n't get a cent of my business ever again .
you pissed me off beyond repair tonight .
overly pepper short ribs .
the rolls are good , but all your healthier options were awful .
great atmosphere but the sushi fell short especially con the prices .
this place is far too inconsistent in food quality for the prices they charge .
the store here also kind of smells bad because of the carpet .
like a stale fish smell .
i walked in although four employees were there no one said a word .
less than _num_ minutes i have a _num_ dollar drink .
made the mistake of coming here on a friday night at 9:00 pm .
at that point they refused to serve us alcohol .
they will ensure you a terrible time .
horrible experience .
waited _num_ minutes and still sitting waiting to be seen .
why make an appointment if they do n't keep it .
ive been craving udon and ramen probably for the last month or so .
i stuck to the tried and true teriyaki chicken .
it really is n't very amazing here , its ok .
the food is n't terrible , it just is n't amazing .
i will not be going back for lunch anytime soon .
the curry sauce was thin , runny , and poorly seasoned .
there were few vegetables in this curry , and the beef was exceptionally tough .
do n't bother , there is better chinese in ahwatukee .
try great wok instead .
poor .
she did n't know so she asked another girl who did n't know either .
bland .
even the sriracha sauce was bland ?
probably not .
i got the pad thai and it was dry .
my old favorite was kung pao chicken , so i ordered it .
so , i asked if somehow they got the order mixed up .
well , it did n't get fix .
well , i was just too hungry to complain any further .
besides , i sometimes do eat orange chicken , so i let it pass .
not going to eat there anymore .
bad , bad , bad .
i took a chance and i was n't proved wrong in my previous statement .
it was brown gravy like consistency with beef in it but almost nothing else .
all this for _num_ dollars .
it did n't smell like panang it didnt look like panang .
do not waste your time and money on this place .
i walked out disgusted .
_num_ cashier was friendly .
cons : too expensive ( $ _num_ for teriyaki chicken and hot wings ?
food is n't anything special !
i will contact my bank and demand my money back .
terrible service , stay away from this place .
really expected better food after seeing _num_ stars .
rip off .
do not bother !
i advised that i was not and recieved a refund and left .
_num_ minutes for chinese food seemed a bit excessive for a to go order .
will not go back again unless calling ahead .
they changed owners recently and the food has suffered .
after this last time i will not be returning .
not at all like it used to be .
no pride in the food .
after tasting a lukewarm soup , we noticed there were no wontons !
only vegetables at the bottom of a large bowl of practically cold broth .
not worth your money or your time .
worst customer service and neither of us will be going back .
unfortunately this place is painfully slow .
tables were not being cleaned after customers left .
go to panda garden guys this place is awful .
nor am i interested helping you fix what you have ruined .
had the `` vietnamese pho '' and was very disappointed .
the broth lacked in flavor , not enough meat and noodles .
my take-out order was wrong , and they made no effort to fix it .
mistakes happen , but i would have expected a better attempt at customer satisfaction .
then they started quickly going down hill .
delivery much longer , food was completely cold and quality went down significantly .
wo n't order takeout or delivery here again .
if you like tasteless food , this is your place .
i wo n't be back - it is n't worth wasting the calories .
ordered _num_ separate dishes .
the pad thai and the ginger shrimp broccoli .
the pad thai was decent , not the best i 've had .
the ginger shrimp broccoli had no flavor .
it was a waste of calories .
i did n't finish it obviously .
i feel like this is a americanized thai food place .
hence the reason the flavors were weak .
very disappointed $ _num_ later too ... over priced for such tasteless food .
i 'm so mixed on this place .
the driver only had $ _num_ on him .
but hey , the delivery driver got a hell of a tip .
if they could consistently provide good service , they would absolutely be _num_ stars .
the lemon chicken , curry , and cashew chicken are all delicious .
ordered an order of egg rolls , crispy beef and chicken pad thai .
`` the driver does n't have them . ''
gross !
absolutely unacceptable and disgusting .
it was clean and the staff were really courteous .
my pho was not really good .
the pho was really disappointing , like i did n't finish it bad .
maybe canned soup would be more competition .
do they make canned pho ?
while `` typical '' chinese cuisine is salty this was more so then average .
i would order again .
both times i politely said , `` no , that 's ok '' .
really turned me off .
i 'll get my magazines elsewhere .
this place is a rip off .
kenny said he would throw in the oil change and lube for free .
none of it was the fault of the staff at brake masters .
they were very courteous and apologetic .
after _num_ hours my vehicle was ready .
the next day i noticed oil on my driveway .
terribly incompetent .
not to mention that my car was returned with the check engine light on .
no , i replied .
it 's this brake masters that is n't fine .
recently i got my brakes done and was n't contacted about repair costs .
the quote just for the rear was $ _num_ !
they did _num_ hours and _num_ minutes worth of work in _num_ minutes .
see why i 'm suspicious of the loose bolt issue .
so i mentioned this yelp review .
the management has changed and they lack a good work ethic .
dry , skimpy and tasteless .
skip it entirely and go to chipotle across the freeway .
waste of money .
very poor customer service this evening and even worse quality as of late .
staff seems friendly but nothing stands out .
just waited over _num_ minutes .
never going back .
ordered the chicken burrito is was _num_ dollars , not including a drink .
the was n't even enough chicken in the burrito to make a taco .
it seriously sucked no flavor at all .
she did n't greet us or say a word .
still not a word from her .
she was extremely rude !
me being there was such an inconvenience to her .
this location is very skimpy on the food .
i would not recommend this location to anyone .
was just not good today .
most likely nobody works at that number cause they have terrible customer service .
just unfriendly and crowded .
to be fair , it 's been years and maybe it 's changed .
but my nightmares about it wo n't .
a $ _num_ gym membership = only _num_ % worthwhile experience .
so lame .
shame on gold 's gym .
just say no to this place .
paid over $ _num_ to get out this place .
just avoid this place .
the girl at the front desk was rude and seemed miserable .
not to mention that their facilities are in decline .
consider yourselves warned !
overall , very disappointed with the customer service here .
do n't waste your time with this gold 's .
the only good thing about this place is the reasonable monthly membership !
scam - false advertising to the max degree .
i 'm sure the attorney general would be interested in hearing about it .
i would not go to this gym again .
the machines are worn out and old .
they really need to spend some money on new equipment .
this does n't exist anymore .
i gave it one star because it does n't exist .
i had such a bad experience here .
i asked for a full set with gel polish .
the woman who started doing my nails seriously would n't listen .
i asked for short and she would not cut more .
i was so annoyed .
she did the most horrible job .
i told them they looked really bad and the polish was horrible .
i wish i would 've just stuck to pink polish .
for _num_ dollars more , it would 've been soooo worth it .
if i could give them a _num_ i would .
also would agree on a previous review , they are no clean .
the water my feet soaked in for _num_ prior min .
worst pedicure and customer service .
huge waste of time and money .
but , i did n't notice a lot of variety .
it was so large i completely forget i showed up near close .
i am never that guy , and felt bad for it .
the other reason is i avoid places with employees that pack heat .
if i could , i would like give no star for this store .
the people work in the store do n't have knowledge about pool .
he was pretty clueless , asking me what type of motor i wanted .
art , the store manager , is completely incompetent .
the rest of the staff is pretty much clueless .
just for convenience can be very expensive !
the carpet is this yucky commercial low pile stuff .
there is a continental breakfast but i was only tried the packaged yogurt .
we booked _num_ rooms , _num_ being handicap accessible .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the 2nd room booked was fine .
got checked in , and went to my room .
parking was okay , never had an issue finding a spot .
really ?
not even a pen to write something down .
they are very rude and extremely unprofessional .
so i can only suggest to stay away from them .
i would n't let the great reviews and the nice pictures fool you !
i am so disappointed !
this is not the quiet comfortable sleep o am used to in hotels !
the ticket prices are okay ; i can live with that .
what i hate are the fees .
one time we let it spin for _num_ minutes .
hell yes i do !
only the system does n't recognize the word `` one '' .
it never arrived .
i tried to call their _num_ number and continuously got a busy signal .
bottom line : no tickets .
they wo n't fix the problem nor exchange or refund tickets .
big fat thumbs down !
what a garbage company .
i will find other ways to secure ticket next time .
i would rather you advertise $ _num_ ticket and include fees .
pure garbage .
no directions , no nothing .
maybe i just expect too much anymore ?
my family of four stayed here one saturday night on august _num_ .
seems like that should be standard on a resort of this caliber .
i was n't impressed for a number of reasons .
come on , they 've been around for what , _num_ years now ?
they should change the name of their water park from oasis to shit creek .
this same thing occurred when we stayed at the resort in july , _num_ .
disgusting .
i must agree with fellow yelpers that it seemed a bit outdated .
i did not like the rooms .
there was a baby sink and mirror area .
the beds were mediocre .
arrived and an hour wait just to check-in .
lobby is hot , uncomfortable temp wise .
very poor customer service so far , especially for the price .
i wo n't be back though .
and i ca n't stop laughing .
we have been for _num_ days and have maid service only three times .
very limited menu and as with most places overpriced .
would not stay here again .
i booked a suite for a conference .
and told me that it was more expensive than the king suite .
_num_ '' tube tvs in the room ?
and do n't bother trying to warm up at the practice facility .
only stayed here because the conference was here .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
will not be coming back .
water park was small and unimpressive , but nice as a bonus maybe ?
_num_ .
this place could be so much better .
there were stains on the carpet and the pillows on the couch .
the water park is the highlight of this resort .
_num_ great water slides , lazy river and a wave pool .
the room on the other hand was very outdated .
staff was friendly with everyone i encountered .
terrible !
poor service with staff making terrible decisions .
water park is so crowded we went to another pool .
not enough chairs anywhere to accommodate guests .
everybody i talked to shared my feelings on this resort .
find another resort !
this is not a _num_ star resort as many sites suggest .
_num_ or _num_ perhaps ?
never - never a _num_ .
the tub did n't drain .
the fridge did n't get cold .
no patio furniture - as all the hotel photos suggest .
very dated and in need of tlc .
it is weird , because the website said it was newly remodeled ?
i would n't go back , and would not recommend it .
the water park was nice though , but the onsite restaurants blew .
terrible food , terrible service .
i would n't recommend a couple stay here for a romantic weekend or anything .
i 'm sure there are nicer and cheaper hotels for that .
the hotel itself is large and spread out .
the outside of the buildings are old and tired .
a night away from the _num_ kids ( our dogs ) !
and on top of that , my lunch was _num_ min late .
this hotel does n't seem to have any concern for the disabled whatsoever .
however , the breakfast cost more than $ _num_ and was basically disgusting .
for $ _num_ we got burnt toast and greasy eggs .
the waiters had no idea what they were doing or what they had .
the dinner , which cost us over $ _num_ , was mediocre at best .
the waiter did n't know how much wine came in a wine glass .
is n't that like training _num_ ?
my fiance gives me better massages and they are free .
so all in all , our $ _num_ turned into over $ _num_ .
this is a hard review to write .
the valet people could n't have been nicer .
both nights !
posted times were open weekly until 9:30 .
so it 's a wash for me .
i was smoking mad about the lobby store closing before the posted time .
and on that , it was late , and several items were missing .
we had an early appointment , and could n't use the lobby restaurant .
the cost of keeping an employee in there is $ _num_ an hour .
basically , _num_ customer an hour will break it even .
but it 's just not a high end experience .
we ate at _num_ of the restaurants , and both were marginal at best .
but do n't eat here ( it 's really overpriced for crappy food ) .
the rooms are really dated .
ok , starting at the beginning .
- the room was hot .
- gross ... there were several places of sticky on the carpeting .
worst hotel experience ever .
the bathrooms are a joke - i 've seen better at motel _num_ .
avoid this place at all costs !
horrible hotel !
this place is run down and not worth the price .
trust me you do n't want to stay here !
the room was expensive , especially considering the summer rates .
we could n't bring in juice for our kids .
i asked the bartender if i got a non alcoholic drink by mistake .
for $ _num_ a drink i felt taken advantage .
we have stayed here before and had a better experience .
it was so loud and ridiculous at that hour .
stayed here this past week on business travel .
just awful .
dirty , stained rooms .
they were completely bad .
this place is definately not worth this kind of money !
_num_ dollars for a hotdog , come on .
stay elsewhere , it 's that simple .
please do n't stay here .
the water slide and lazy river is not working !
the room here is old and not worth the money .
our keys does n't work when we checked in .
had to get a second set and still does n't work .
i hate this place .
the room was musty and the food was so-so .
very disappointed .
would not recommend this resort .
service is awful .
good thing i 'm not an early to bed kind of guy .
this property is old and tired .
they are awkward , lacking confidence and apparently even basic check in skills .
i am glad that i did not pay for this less than memorable experience .
glad i did n't pay for that either .
seemed very strange , but ultimately i did n't have to pay it .
what a disappointment .
checked in at 6:00 to find out was closed .
tells me , tough luck , you must not be telling the truth .
our room was the same room we were originally booked into .
made brittany refund that charge .
our mini bar was not locked or stocked when we checked in .
not so .
we wo n't be staying here or recommending it to anyone again .
there are too many great resorts in phoenix to waste my money here .
there was absolutely no value to it at all .
avoid if you 're on any sort of realistic budget .
my wife and daughter would remain in the car .
the valet demanded my car keys .
it looks like a rear entrance .
11:00 turns and the gate does n't open .
no sign ?
they could n't say that once for the previous _num_ minutes ?
saturday night we called the front desk to get a late checkout .
trust me when i tell you that hotel did not look very occupied .
that 's criminal .
upon arriving there was men 's hair in the shower which was disgusting .
it just feels very unclean .
also called the concierge , spent _num_ minutes on hold & gave up .
just not happy with this experience so far .
but the rooms / cleanliness / etc .
is not up to par .
the staff needs an upgrade .
apparently they 've changed management and the customer no longer comes first .
hotel rooms not so good .
this place is quite outdated .
it feels like i 've traveled back in time _num_ years .
he was extremely rude .
no patio furniture on the patio , a little strange .
year two for our family and we will not be back .
service horrible in oasis , even when paying extra $ _num_ for a cabana .
waters empty .
for _num_ hours , rarely checked in on us .
staff has been rude or non-existent at every turn .
if i were spending my own money , i would be super pissed .
i give the resort _num_ stars only for the people who work there .
as for the resort itself , i 'd give it _num_ if i could .
the website made it appear much more grand than it really is .
the rooms are outdated and dirty .
it was very small and all the fixtures felt cheap .
when the girls went to lay on the sofa bed it was actually painful .
the mattress is all springs with no mattress left .
the king bed in the bedroom was old and tired too .
the general building and grounds are tired !
clearly , this area does not get cleaned or maintained at all .
if they ever arrived it was after a very long time .
two of them were either a long walk away or a golf cart ride .
the wave pool was a joke .
the lazy river was always packed with people .
we booked a staycation here , and i regret it .
anytime you need anything like a towel or shampoo they expect you to tip .
it was way over crowded and downright dangerous .
this place leaves much to be desired .
the staff is incompetent .
very poor customer service .
which is understandable but nothing was done .
no compensation took place .
we were here to celebrate our first anniversary .
prices are of a nicer resort but do n't let it fool you .
at least motel _num_ will leave the light on .
we will never spend time or money here again .
disappointed !
is n't that a better answer than saying we do n't take reservations ?
this is not one of them .
upon arriving we soon realized that our room had no internet .
we were very disappointed in this hotel and will never ever again stay here !
seriously this place is a ripoff !
our first day there was no maid service to our room .
the grounds are what make it a resort , not the experience .
umm , just a bad experience here .
the front _num_ was okay but the back _num_ was just weird .
let 's call it target golf in a bad way .
he even kicked the ball on the green while we were putting .
do n't even want to give one star .
although the resort is nice , the staff was not friendly nor accommodating .
the wait to check in was ridiculously long , on a saturday afternoon .
there were only _num_ people working and the line was _num_ deep .
needless to say , that didnt happen .
got the ol , `` my bad '' but no adjustment to the bill !
will not be back !
just spent $ _num_ to stay _num_ nights at the arizona grand .
the bad : lots to list .
$ _num_ resort fee per night .
also up to _num_ people can stay in this room -- one towel hook ?
did that one time and then left the property for coffee every other morning .
breakfast buffet -- $ _num_ for adults and $ _num_ for kids .
room keys that take up to _num_ attempts to work .
property seems extremely understaffed for this price point .
signage is also lacking .
wo n't be back unfortunately .
disgusting does n't begin to cover the review for this hotel .
room smelled like mildew and was beat up and dirty .
do n't let the photos fool you !
the line to even get in the water park was ridiculous .
not a relaxing way to spend spring break .
that 's how bad it was .
pool was ok , but water filthy and way overcrowded .
and there was no charge for jumping up and grabbing one .
easter brunch overpriced .
for the dough , go to disney .
lukewarm refrigerator filled with crap so you can not store your own food .
now for the bad .
so , save your money and eat breakfast elsewhere .
if you want regular ice cream , expect to pay $ _num_ a scoop .
service was ridiculously slow , even during non busy times .
hell to the no .
fool me once , but you wo n't fool me twice .
no massage , no hot towels , lotion nothing .
they were thick , paint from nail to nail was very uneven just horrible .
turns out the other two girls that went with me had the same problem .
so they gave me a complimentary mani .
again we ca n't get in at the same time , no big deal .
kinda nice gave us a chance to chit chat .
$ _num_ dollar pedi .
still not saying a word while looking at my hands .
so we are done with that disaster .
i head to the restroom only to be disgusted with how dirty it was .
such a waste of time and money .
this is a resort , you pay more for the experience .
do not stay here , this resort is a total ripoff !
it was ok besides the charges made to my card .
that is so stupid .
the water park was not even all that .
that is ridiculous and trust me it is not worth your buck here .
save your money and go elsewhere .
run from this money pit !
the only problem is the huge expense for everything !
the course is in pathetic shape .
the course is in horrible shape , always has been .
it was ok the rooms were clean .
the building was old and the balcony was not private .
the price was more then our cabana in hawaii .
tacky !
when we went to our suite it was `` filthy '' .
shower .
service at poolside bad .
after _num_ mins on hold we gave up .
for the price we are paying , mexico will be next trip .
check in was mediocre with an explanation of things on site .
they had a wave pool , a lazy river and some slides .
it 's $ _num_ for most mixed drinks that are not even that strong .
i would probably never stay at this resort again unfortunately .
it was just too high priced for what was given .
for two nights with the stay and play package it was around $ _num_ .
i was really disappointed in this property .
next , really , there are no luggage carts ?
i was seriously disappointed by this resort .
it was packed as bad as wet n wild if not worse .
no reason to waste more money and hang around in the room .
we checked in at 4:30 and left at 7:30 .
they wanted to charge $ _num_ for this `` service '' .
the taxes are way higher than other hotels in the area .
we are extremely disappointed with our stay at az grand .
only one tv of the two worked .
we were handed a map with brief explanation how to find our room .
the water park was so crowded it was not enjoyable .
love the place but the hidden _num_ $ resort fee kills the experience .
very unhappy customer !
check in was mediocre with little to no explanation of anything .
the grounds and getting around was very confusing .
room very loud with freeway noise .
wait staff is very slow and not at all accommodating .
over an hour wait for cold sandwiches .
would never come back if i was choosing my own accommodations .
halfway through my week stay .
hot dog , $ _num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
what a piece of crap .
_num_ .
_num_ .
room service- hot water for tea and milk with tip was $ _num_ .
_num_ .
i thought this would be a plush vacation but it was not very relaxing .
_num_ .
ca n't believe they get away with charging such high rates !
do n't recommend wasting your money here !
when we got there , the hotel looked old from the outside .
the carpet was stained and dirty , they need to shampoo it .
the living room was not at all like the picture .
it reminded me of a run down embassy suites .
i am assuming this hotel is old because of the odd layout .
bottom line , the rooms felt like a run down embassy suites .
they said `` suites with resort view '' but yeah , it was not .
i give it a _num_ stars for the room that i stayed in .
they really should close at _num_ pm like the other hotels .
the area of the hotel is not good .
i dunno ... it seemed `` tired '' to me .
overall : disappointed .
a burger with run you north of $ _num_ !
pina colada $ _num_ !
stayed _num_ night in a villa for work on a corporate rate .
the grounds were nice and so was the water park .
we wo n't be staying here again .
we were disappointed in this resort , except for the fantastic water park .
although the water park was fun , the staff was unfriendly .
we will not be booking a room here in the future !
anyways , the decor is rustic but outdated .
the menu is limited , and you have no options .
not a fan of ranch ?
it was n't dry .
sounds bad but i was thankful for my mom 's disabled parking tag .
the veggies were piping hot and the baked beans were tasty .
for the price , i would expect much better food .
worst ribs i 've ever paid money for .
well , its pretty bad - very fried .
the side salad and biscuit were decent .
everything that followed was overpriced and nasty .
the steak was not good .
worst service i 've ever had .
wasted three hours of my life i 'll never get back .
the only draw here is the view of the city lights .
but the service was painfully slow .
the food was `` eh '' , but not great .
we sit down and our server just sucked .
she completely ruined my experience .
the server was rude to both my mother and i .
bland , slow , no personality .
that was enough for us to leave and never return .
too bad , i kind of miss the place .

i 've had a better meal at texas roadhouse !
personally i will not go back again .
i 'm sick of this place .
food sucked .
this was perhaps , the wrong venue for us .
our meal was atrocious !
i will never repeat this horrid experience .
i was visiting from out of town and was brought here by some locals .
the food is quite mediocre .
ok ... you 're either gon na love it or leave it .
the appetizer was nothing fancy .
$ _num_ dollar for dinner for _num_ without alcohol .
my steak had almost no flavor .
meh meh meh ... .
not much more to say .
for a place famous for it 's steaks and ribs i was sorely disappointed .
poor service .
there are better places to spend your money .
rip off !
the servers are good people , the atmosphere is typical for a steak place .
not really mountains to me ) .
the burgers my friend got , looked dry and zero character .
obviously the burger was n't that huge , but it looked lame .
the pork chop was also very dry .
it is as if they squeezed the juices out of it .
even with some bbq sauce eating it was nearly impossible .
i 've had soo much better before .
it was lacking in all areas of its life .
end of the line _num_ star because the food was blech !
very marginal food , service , and atmosphere .
in the end - they are too busy to have good service .
food is better elsewhere for the cost .
the meal was not fresh .
the bbq chicken was dry and tough to eat .
the ribs were also dry .
both of the kabobs were much better than the rest of the meal .
i would not recommend this dish at the end of the day .
it was horrible !
this is a country western themed steakhouse , so whatever , be warned .
third , the service was the worst .
she was rude and not very helpful ... at all .
fourth , the food was mediocre , at best .
the green bean and corn on the cob sides were soggy .
waited _num_ minutes for check .
not sure but i think the ribs were coyote .
overall terrible experience .
i could receive better customer service from a drive thru window .
she gave dirty looks after we approached the manager regarding our issues .
the food was not the greatest .
the food was not the best and the waitress and staff are terrible .
not to mention most items are _num_ or more a plate for garbage food .
i could receive better customer service from a drive thru window .
she gave dirty looks after we approached the manager regarding our issues .
the food was not the greatest .
as first timers he explained the menu and asked f there were any questions .
bread and butter arrived quickly .
the meal came with green beans and corn on the cob .
there were two orders for baked potatoes .
we are not likely to return to this restaurant .
wow , this dull theme park of a restaurant is horrible .
not appetizing !
my colleague 's bone-in rib-eye , ordered medium-rare , was chewy and bland .
why would n't they at least salt a nice steak ?
prices for their tasteless entrees were high , from $ _num_ to $ _num_ .
this place is awful .
yes , i 'm not making this up .
the couple seated long after us had already eaten their steaks and gone home .
the food was lukewarm and nothing memorable .
the waitress looked at , made eye contact with me , then kept walking .
i normally tip _num_ % for decent service and _num_ % for bad .
everything was very basic and boring , cooked without passion .
salad wilted and tired .
wine list poor .
when advised this was not acceptable .
this situation stressed my son so much he was unable to eat with us .
the parking lot was full which made us regret choosing this place to eat .
but when we got inside and seated it wasnt that busy .
she was tired and was getting cranky .
the best part of my meal was the baked potato .
it looked just plain nasty .
she says `` you only get one . ''
she says `` you ca n't buy extra '' i 'm like fine whatever .
then you leave and pass the stinky cow again .
both were very , very poorly prepared .
neither were finished .
my steak was less than 1/3 inch thick and severely overcooked .
i would have returned it but did n't see the waitress again .
it had absolutely zero seasoning and tasted like cardboard .
if you want a steak , go elsewhere .
it was like he grabbed the cup from the back of a dense closet .
the cowboy beans provided tasted like ketchup and pepper , absolutely horrible .
i never received a refill , but our waiter was hard to find .
he was pretty clueless .
ugh .
my burger was overcooked and the bun was hard .
the fries were barely warm .
ok with that even though it means standing in entrance hallway .
by now over an hour has passed , it is after 8pm .
left hungry & not happy .
friendly staff , just clueless on policies and pleasing the customer .
food was bad , nothing i would expect at a steakhouse .
both steaks were overcooked !
had n't been there in years .
we chose a low top by the window because of our child .
so we get our drinks and take them to the table .
skip ahead to ordering .
all dinners are served with green beans and a tiny corn on the cob .
both were gross !
my husband did not eat them and thats saying a lot !
when they showed up , i would have ate his steak !
both were overcooked .
but ... only have ranch dressing or oil and vinegar .
service was mediocre at best .
we tried the rattlesnake with prickly pear cactus fries .
went in on a whim last night , cool atmosphere .
the salad was soggy and tasted like it 'd been sitting out for awhile .
fries were stale and cold and the burger totally fell apart .
we could n't even eat it .
gross !
waste of money .
i could n't even see what i was eating .
when i tasted it i did n't need to see it .
so sad i ca n't get my money back .
hurts to have money taken out of my pocket on christmas .
my dinner went to the trash .
steaks were mediocre .
vegetables and sides were awful .
awful ... just awful , go somewhere ... anywhere else the food is horrible !
the service is just bad too , rude waitress .
skip the rattlesnake tho .
unless you love breading dipped in ranch dressing .
cactus fries were pretty good .
bartenders just this side of rude .
that 's the only reason i did n't give it a _num_ .
on such a nice night , no outside seating ?
this is my 2nd time here and same rudeness at the bar .
terrible .
nope , just as bad .
the band is too loud .
the ambiance and view is a _num_ .
the service is a _num_ .
i have no words .
_num_ for atmosphere and _num_ for food .
i was told no and even after explaining way i was told no again .
was i wrong !
the gm came over and was n't too accommodating , offering a free dessert .
service was terrible .
avoid !
the attitude of the staff was unlike anything i have experienced in this area .
and i do n't mean good !
there were _num_ other tables - all of whom seemed to be getting attention .
the food was ok but sub par compared to other restaurants .
to call this a steakhouse is laughable .
best i can say is mediocre over priced nursing home food .
waste of time and money .
dont waste your money .
what a huge disappointment .
the food was terrible !
our guest was too polite to complain .
my husbands bone in rib eye was a tasteless overcooked disaster .
not worth going to even for the view .
zero stars .
the burger meat was dry and underwhelming for that price !
others at the table ordered fried chicken , white meat , for $ _num_ .
the chicken breast was massive , dry and rubbery .
the place seems worn out and dirty .
please do n't waste your money as it was extremely disappointing .
food does n't have any taste .
french fries are burned and the food was really bad .
worst service !
the waitress and manager very inattentive and rude .
the service is not good at all .
we asked the server what happened and she was rude and dismissive .
totally not apologetic .
worst service ever for large parties .
i 'm sorry but that 's just terrible .
the best part about the dinner was probably the indian fry bread .
everything else was edible .
very mediocre .
on the plus side , my steak was cooked perfectly ( med .
the real downside to this is the pricing ... very expensive !
i ordered the big burger and was sorely disappointed .
the burger patty was over cooked , soaked in grease , and tasteless .
the fries were nothing special nor were the onion rings .
super disappointed and i will not be returning anytime soon .
i even got my husband to go down the slide !
they brought out some salad and indian fry bread and biscuits while we waited .
sorry , but at these prices i expect butter .
they insisted there was pink in it but we could n't see it .
save your money while enjoying the view , slide and dancing .
shame !
at this point , offering a drink or dessert would have been thoughtful .
i could not even cut my steak .
service was quick and friendly but what they served was awful .
seemed like everything was old and flavorless .
the place is awesome .
every time i get the absolute worse service .
terrible place .
also not good .
no crazy spices .
came with vegetables that did n't look terribly healthy .
the salad was watery from too much ranch .
service was slow but adequate .
seriously , do not go here .
the food was inedible , the service was worse .
i 'd give it _num_ starts but thats not an option .
our fried shrimp were burned , the ribs were the same way .
the fish kabobs were raw and the beans were cold .
having spent $ _num_ per person on this meal we expected much much more .
sadly , it 's a shadow of its former self .
this is not the kind of place that you go to for the food .
this should be a drinks only stop .
the food was below average and took nearly _num_ minutes to arrive .
we ordered our steaks medium , they came out lukewarm and bloody .
nachos were generic , tasted like they had been microwaved to melt the cheese .
several tables around us made complaints and sent their food back .
i had join my _num_ adult children for dinner there friday night .
dan garcia should not be in a position that he deals with the public .
my husband and i chose this place after golfing one sunday .
our server was as close to useless as one can get .
i ordered the half slab of pork ribs and they were not good .
way overcooked and dried out .
the corn on the cob was a soggy overcooked mess .
worst place we 've been to in a long time .
would not even give one star .
was told a _num_ minute wait but was n't seated for _num_ hrs !
continued to ask and was always told , `` only a few minutes '' .
i am no food snob but my chicken was dry .
ridiculous and i 'm still hungry .
do n't waste your time and money .
views not that great anyways .
the food however ... not so good .
be careful of this place .
because of this one i our party had to leave before we ate .
this is completely unacceptable and we will never be back !
thanksgiving dinner disappointment !
worst service !
no separate lines for reservations and for walk ins .
we will have to wait for _num_ min + .
no really apologies and the hostess were completely disorganized and lacked good service .
she deserves to be hired at a fine dinning restaurant .
not sure really worth the price .
when my spouse was cutting the turkey he was pushed by a busser .
so rude .
the only thing they got right was the turkey and yummy salad .
but really an hour and a half ?
highlight of the meal was the apple pie .
well , food was bad .
my shrimp was tasteless ... .
no seasoning at all .
bland rice .
an adorable bull is near the entrance and the view is awesome .
but i would say this place is more for kids than an adult night .
unfortunately , the begging waiting no reservation process was difficult .
dry beef , low end salad .
i am hoping management reads this and makes a serious improvement .
... food quality for a _num_ hour meal would be appreciated .
this is the only review i have ever written .
absolute rip off if you ask me .
anyway , other than the food , the service was just awful !
false .
it was too spicy to know whether or not it tasted good .
view is good , beer selection is poor .
terrible food , terrible service .
glad we did n't wait to be served .
what a mistake .
we had n't even explained our issue by that point .
it 's no wonder that place has such bad reviews .
it 's terribly run , and the food is terrible .
do n't waste your money .
the theme of this place is amazing but unfortunately their food is not that great.
i expected more for my buck because it 's not cheap .
i arrived and the restaurant was extremely busy .
i think our wait was around the _num_ minute mark .
it was impossible to have a conversation when this happened .
neither of the steaks were cooked as ordered .
last night , however , was a less than enjoyable experience .
but surely no one comes here for the food , let alone the steaks .
there was no flavor to this steak .
oh , and despite the novelty , do n't bother with the rattlesnake appetizer .
it has to be one of the worst things on the menu .
no , it does n't taste like chicken .
_num_ of us in our party ordered the nacho appetizer as our entree .
probably will not be back .
mr memory of this restaurant was much better than reality .
was rather disappointed with the food .
this place is bad all around .
and now that i 've experienced it i warn you this place is bad .
the food is not that good and the prices are high .
this is my third time here and it was just as bad as before .
service is not good .
i had the new york strip this round and it had zero flavor .
corn on the cobb had been in the pot since yesterday all mushy .
may not be back after this trip just because of the service ... .
very loud with live music and very mediocre food .
when i asked for an extra table i was met with frustration and attitude .
we sent it back only to get a burnt steak back .
salad tastes like a packaged salad and the dressing had no flavor .
so disappointed !
we will not be back !
potatoes are ala carte .
the $ _num_ filet was tough and fatty with no flavor .
i was not impressed with this establishment .
the overall atmosphere was n't bad .
Negative
it did n't taste like it was seasoned at all .
i wish i had taken some pictures .
very boring , plain , and unappetizing .
i will not be going back .
the waitress had no idea of what either of the beverages was .
i expected so much more from a place such as this .
i do n't see us going back again .
our bread basket literally consisted of hard as rock bread .
our server was n't seen much , drinks were empty a very long time .
this used to be our go to place for out of town guests .
do n't take full size vehicle .
wait time was atrocious despite lots of empty tables .
serving staff was poorly trained .
they did n't bring us any napkins , silverware , or plates with appetizers .
chips were stale .
eventually left because we could n't get seated at full service table .
i wo n't try to eat there again .
sadly disappointed .
honestly , this place is the worst .
so we sat and were treated as if we were the worst .
with that in mind , we did n't stay for dinner .
if i could give this place less than _num_ star i would .
secondly it 's so dark you can hardly see your food .
it was so fatty , flavorless and gross .
straight up the worst food i 've ever had .
it started off right but then went downhill pretty fast .
i remember most of it being pretty bland and dry .
not much else .
great establishment but horrible waitress we will not be back .
worst place ever !
food is inedible , facility old and dirty , service under par .
nothing good about it except for the city view .
place has _num_ stars and thats pushing it .
hands down worst steak in my life .
moderate food , poor service but unbeatable views and family friendly location .
go here with out of town guests but not for a nice evening out .
the food was salty for some items & dry for others .
i can think of much better ways to blow my money .
unfortunately have to give _num_ stars .
the food was overpriced and terrible !
none of which was discounted or taken off the bill .
highly disappointed .
unfortunately we will not return .
had better steak in the lunch room at high school .
really disappointing as i 'd heard rave reviews about the place .
almost booked a company dinner for _num_ here too !
also tried the rattlesnake as an appetizer .
it was tasteless and way over cooked and way over priced .
really bad .
ny strip was thick bland and poor quality meat .
all other sides were bad .
no second chance .
the food and the service have really gone downhill .
the waitstaff was not attentive .
all in all , i would n't go back .
overall , our dining experience was okay .
rustic theme would be ok , if i thought it was clean .
it was big but not flavorful .
next time ordered wings and potato skins .
kids ate _num_ of the wings and left .
even the pre dinner biscuits and scone were bland .
our dinner was $ _num_ .
quickly , things turned from exciting to horrible .
the waiter did n't give us napkins but was overall okay .
i got the food and tried it and it was disgusting .
we got it and they hated it so they sent it back .
i did n't try it .
the meat was tough and had so much fat .
they were extremely sour as well .
i love dessert and i did n't even want to order it .
oh and the bathroom was gross .
rattlesnake prepared horrible and the price ridiculous !
sides disgusting !
salad limp and lukewarm .
beans just awful .
poor service ... actually horrible service .
i do not recommend this place it was a huge disappointment !
however our party was starving .
the bad is the bathrooms .
just my _num_ cents .
such a disappointment .
we will not be back .
come here for the experience of it , not the food .
this is one place that i would never refer anyone to .
it was heavy on the croutons and lacking in any taste other than lettuce .
Neutral
i wish there were negative stars that i could give on here !
worst experience ever !
what i was very irritated by was the staff yelling excuse me !
that is just poor taste from a service stand point .
it 's overpriced and low quality .
this was probably one of the worse meals we have had .
there was _num_ in our party .
my wife 's wings were overcooked and poor tasting .
cool atmosphere but i would n't recommend eating here.
there was an hour wait to be seated .
( the drinks were way over priced anyways ! )
the food was absolutely terrible .
!
this place is considered a steakhouse ?
more like a child care service with mediocre food .
noisy , no dress code , extremely slow service and really disappointing .
stupid kids running everywhere .
the view was nice but not worth the time we spent driving there .
they have a home ranch that is awesome .
the taste and texture was similar to frog legs mixed with chicken .
it was fried which pretty much makes any protein taste the same .
the accompanying fried mushrooms were tasty .
the steaks were cooked to the right temperature , but were not seasoned well .
overall i was n't too impressed and have no plans to return .
the second time around was a joke .
shame on me .
do not wear a tie !
the bad : food - the salad comes pre-made with ranch dressing .
the carrots are overcooked .
their seasoning is lacking and the steak was bland .
needless to say , i 'll never be back .
it was pretty disappointing to say the least .
it fell way way short .
food is mediocre at best , and was served lukewarm .
bland flavor overall .
otherwise skip it .
it 's not for classy people .
there was no taste .
had the worst margarita .
no salt on the rim .
as i said , it 's not a place for city people .
waiting for _num_ pm !
no greeting .
not even in a nice tone !
oh and all booths are empty .
after being told about the mimosas and omelet bar i am pissed !
my poor mother is bummed !
i assume it is not fresh .
literally in ten mins everything was out .
the bill came out to $ _num_ for four .
the brunch was $ _num_ with a buffet and mimosas .
such a disappointment .
this is a place that i would not recommend to anyone .
five minutes later our server bring out a bowl of salad and some bread .
the vegetables that were served were overcooked and pretty tasteless .
ok food served in a southern way , and the staff wear cowboy hats .
poor bull ... hardly even moves in there .
this was the worst experience we 've had here !
horrible service and just okay food .
after starting out okay , it quickly went downhill .
apparently it 's done on the computer , but it 's wrong .
despite all this , the manager did not seem to care .
not sure we 'll come back after this experience .
such s disappointment !
checked this place out after a relative suggested it .
extremely disappointing experience .
there were _num_ of us .
the management was not helpful when we shared our feelings with them .
we could n't even get water refills .
they had an excuse for everything tasting terrible .
there are plenty of places close by to get much better steak .
complete and total garbage of an experience and restaurant .
steaks were cold , sides were cold .
he handed his card quickly and walked away in a hurry .
what an absolutely pathetic excuse for a restaurant .
please spend your money elsewhere .
poor food baked potato not done .
horrible fat filled steak .
beans and fried mushrooms were good .
corn mushy and over cooked .
ordered a filet and was tasteless .
took forever , our table was almost done eating .
asked him to try it but he refused .
but just continued to argue the point but would not try it .
and manager did nothing to make it right i mean nothing !
just presented us with the rest of the expensive bill .
so maybe the general manager should call us if they care .
poor food baked potato not done .
very disappointed poor quality and poor preparation on food .
these people make me sick .
way to make your customers uncomfortable , awkward and angry .
everyone in there is rude , looks down on you and so incredibly unhelpful .
never again would i put anyone in their hands .
painfully slow .
i 'm making sure everyone knows how i feel about this credit union .
terrible customer service .
very slow .
coming to this branch is worse than going to the dentist .
customer service is awful .
ruins my whole day when i have to come here .
this branch has unfriendly employees with lousy customer service skills .
this is the worse credit union i have ever dealt with .
if you have to reach somebody by phone it is a nightmare .
terrible company .
she does n't know how horrible the company she works for is .
terrible company .
the customer service is no service at all .
worse experience ever !
took forever to get our tab !
quick _num_ hour visit turned into _num_ hours of pain !
extremely disappointed !
horrible customer service .
they never returned any of my calls for explanation .
this cleaners has become an over priced poorly managed cleaners .
horrible dry cleaner .
they were practically already ruined , so i let them try .
around _num_ dollars of clothing was ruined by this dry cleaner .
awful , awful service .
can not follow directions .
careless , shoddy work .
i am sure there are better choices .
no offer to actually fix it .
this sweater only visited this store and was never washed by me .
but was not .
i was told my family member had already been paid for it .
i did n't get one .
it was all bubbly and looked awful .
do n't bother with this hole .
however , that is not why i am writing this review today .
i left this place shocked and disgusted at how this woman treats her employees .
if i were that girl i would have quit on the spot .
the service is terrible here .
the kids behind the counter are usually rude and dismissive .
they actually complain about their hours and their management to the customers .
it 's too bad this subway is closest to my home .
leave people alone when they eat !
not only is this place dirty , they are always out of everything .
you want italian herbs and cheese bread ?
too bad .
not here .
one of the worst experiences i 've had at a subway .
the two young ladies working were completely unprofessional and rude the entire time .
disgusting .
too slow - drive to another one .
it 's a sandwich , it 's not a difficult thing to make .
then again i did n't know they hired people who smoke pot .
do n't fall for their _num_ % off coupon either !
also , i never complain or write reviews .
but i have never had such bad customer service .
unless you have all day , stay away from the walgreens drive-thru .
that is not the case with these more expensive jobs .
place is abandoned and locked down .
worst mcdonald 's in town ?
well i 'm looking at the food and it 's not right .
very disappointed once again .
management needs to overhaul this place !
this man has no right to say that i never buy anything from there .
i never knew someone could ever be so rude running a business .
he tells me that it was $ _num_ cents .
usually i would n't mind paying an extra $ _num_ .
terrible customer service , so , so rude .
too bad there is n't _num_ stars .
tried this place for the first time tonight - will not be going back .
very unsatisfied .
she also compared returning my food like returning a car someone just bought .
i have never been so angry about the way a business owner treated me .
horrible way to run a business .
okay , it 's not bad really .
but most of the food is really just average , if not bad .
i dont know how this place stayed open .
i tried the place again hoping for a better visit ... not impressed .
consistently disappointing .
but it was never anything special .
i went in last month and had the worst experience .
she hardly listened to what i wanted for a hair cut .
she suggested i go short when i clearly did not want to go short .
i was so uncomfortable !
horrible !
hard to say .
even the pickles , which i had been wanting for a while .
hooters has closed this location , sorry .
not so much ... ... .
first impression : this place smells like a locker room .
i wo n't be frequenting this establishment any time soon .
thank god i never paid anything to go there .
obviously , he has n't it 's a women 's only dance studio .
ridiculous !
_num_ dec _num_ actually a 1/2 of a star for business practices .
la fitness does not have any gyms here .
i 'm been trying to cancel my membership since november .
i am having problems getting on to the la fitness website .
so i 'm waiting for the manager to call me .
please that is bad business practices .
i try to avoid that happening though because i dislike this gym that much .
bad business practice .
poor management .
they do not back up their employees mistakes .
my problem was partially resolved which still unacceptable to me .
our family will not look at la fitness for gym needs in the future .
i never interacted with the staff , only the front door person .
the sales people i interacted with is very pushy and annoying .
they will not stop calling you .
yet i can sign up in _num_ seconds on the website .
Neutral
i wish there were negative stars to give .
save your money and frustration .
their restrooms smell and their staff is rude and unprofessional .
however , i do n't love the employees .
they have a really hard time with the word no .
crappy service today .
i wo n't say i love this location .
_num_ stars because it does the job and has a variety of equipment .
although there is a large variety of equipment it just seems outdated and crusty .
it does the job do n't get be wrong .
also , the locker rooms are disgusting , and they smell .
the level of customer service is at an all time low .
there are no managers .
the worst customer service at front desk .
the people who work here are lazy !
avoid falling for the personal training contract at all costs .
if you are serious about getting personal training , do so elsewhere .
in regards to the facilities , the front desk people are hit and miss .
facilities are n't well maintained , everything has a dirty feel .
do yourself a favor and pay the extra money to get a lifetime membership .
service was weak .
only one server and he was overwhelmed .
i will not go back to this waffle house again .
eh ... but its cheap and you get what you pay for .
it was worse than a microwave meal from the grocery store .
this has completely turned us away from wanting to eat here .
service was the worst .
my eggs were raw and strawberries on waffle old .
in all my years i have never seen a restaurant this poorly ran .
now its only the first time for this place but seriously .
and really ... no back up when you knew i was coming .
i would never go to this place for a pedicure again .
will not be back .
went into get my brows waxed and was dissatisfied .
no more visits there for me .
i 've gone in several times for gel manicures .
my experience mirrors kevin i 's below .
worst experience !
it was the most uncomfortable experience i 've ever had at a nail salon .
never going back .
my services were free because i refused to pay .
not because she comped me .
also , my nails were never painted .
finally , she was not remotely upset that my manicure was bad .
it was awful .
my most recent experience was not good .
she was very aggressive with my eyebrow wax .
that 's never happened to me before with waxing .
also , the cash only tip policy is ridiculous .
i waited for _num_ minutes and they said they would be right with me .
i got sat in a chair with cold water and no massage .
note she still charged me for her poorly done nails .
i 've been here a couple of times and had no bad experiences .
today though , i got there at _num_ and left around _num_ .
i went here for _num_ years before switching to public school .
it 's not great like everyone thinks !
both come and i try them with no success .
my computer wo n't recognize the new battery .
on day three , i call to check in .
two days later , still have not heard back .
nearly two weeks later , i call them back .
ca n't open on time ?
had the most unprofessional and rude experience ever at a packaging store .
wrote a detailed complaint to their management , still waiting for a response .
that type of behavior has no place in a professionally run business .
it 's _num_ not the _num_ 's .
this place is horrible .
it really made me feel uncomfortable about the whole ordeal .
i will not be returning to this location for any reason .
they cut my moms toes so much that they were bleeding .
never going back .
never ever will i go here again .
got there at _num_ and there did n't get out til after _num_ pm .
bad service , bad pedicure .
bad business !
horrible horrible customer service .
very very disappointed in this salon and i will never ever return .
i had a groupon and scheduled my appointment just fine .
do n't use that groupon !
this place is creepy and dirty .
the stylist are either _num_ years old or have neck tattoos .
the hair dye is like water and the blow outs are horrible .
everyone looks miserable and the facility looks like no one cares about its appearance .
they have horrible reviews .
i showed up and no one was at the front desk .
i waited over _num_ minutes and no one came to greet me .
there was _num_ person getting their hair washed .
i had a very bad gut feeling and left .
i did not even get to choose the color .
i really expected more from a salon in ahwatukee .
i do not recommend this place .
had to wait _num_ minutes before beginning my partial highlights & cut .
yea i left there looking like a _num_ year old did my hair .
frank had no customer service skills what so ever & i was truly disappointed .
dont buy the groupon and certainly dont cash it in .
this salon needs to be shut down by the sanitation department !
when i called back i said i would change my appointment for then .
well , i was so wrong .
i only realized my shirt was ruined when i got home .
then , when it was time for the cut , so terrible .
i was not impressed and very disappointed .
i would n't recommend this place to anyone .
i was not greeted until _num_ minutes later .

i work for a hotel so i understand the hospitality business .
this is not how you treat someone .
i do n't deserve this and will have groupon offer me something .
this is the worst baskin robbins i 've been to .
that should n't be allowed to happen .
our experience at thai basil was sub-par at best .
it tasted like noodles sauteed in hot sauce and ... that 's it .
not even good .
not sure how you can make that soup bland , but they did it .
ranks poorly against some of the great thai restaurants i have visited .
would have enjoyed a non fried appetizer ?
nothing about this place , including service gave me the impression we would return .
heard good things , but , did not even measure up .
very bland ... really man ?
it 's thai how can it be flavorless ?
do n't waste your time !
this location on a saturday night was not very busy ( mostly takeout ) .
we dined in ... and the service was not very good .
three of us ordered pad thai w/ chicken .
would not recommend this location .
wow , there food ( wtf ) could use some work .
they 're always packed whenever i pickup a lunch takeout too .
got sick from here ... my food came out in about _num_ seconds .
food and service mediocre .
the worst place i have ever been .
the service was horrible and the food was even worse .
if u are someone who values customer service this isnt the place for you .
i 've been here multiple times the service continues to get worse .
seriously , you ca n't afford to hire a couple of waiters ?
my colleague bit into his egg roll to spit out a bolt .
worst customer service ever !
very poor customer service .
the waiters were horrible .
the manager is nothing but rude and does n't know anything about customer service .
someone like that should be ashamed in calling himself a supervisor .
worse thai food i had in a while .
no flavor at all had a curry .
was pretty much coconut water with very little veggies and almost no taste .
the food was way over priced for what it was .
service was dry and lacked friendliness , would not go back .
i am leaving thai basil incredibly disappointed .
the food is great but tonight the service was miserable .
spend $ _num_ and it was nothing that we ordered .
chicken curry .
then i get home with second order and it 's way to spicy .
did not even get a soup or salad , no side or drinks .
this is n't the first time .
the pad thai was not that good .
the lady on the phone was confusing and frustrating to talk to .
the pain was keeping me up at night .
i was excited to get to the bottom of it and resolve the issue .
i travel _num_ minutes from north scottsdale to his office in ahwatukee .
i arrived at _num_ and was kept waiting until _num_ when he came in .
what a waste of time and money .
my leg issue was not addressed and i was clearly disappointed .
disappointed .
dr a came highly referred by a co-worker .
this was the only treatment is been receiving for my shoulder from dr a .
do not wax at this salon as she practices on clients .
i wo n't charge you for this one .
i will never return here .
ridiculous .
i will not take my business there again .
this is the worst sonic drive in in the united states .
worst service every single time .
every single time i come to this location i completely regret it .
never again !
if they ca n't respond with some sort of empathy i am done .
horrible service and soggy burger .
seemed very nervous to even talk we could n't even hear him .
the drive-thru at this location is horrible .
you pull up and they do n't even greet you promptly .
then they were extremely short with their responses .
very disappointed .
slow service , mediocre food .
the taste of the food did not meet my expectations .
last visit was saturday december _num_ for dinner .
apparently the overhead lights in the lobby were out .
my vegetables were overlooked as was my steak .
my daughter 's steak was overlooked as well .
my husband 's burger was overlooked and dry .
we will not be back there again .
poor service , but i do n't blame the server herself .
it was a weekday and they were terribly understaffed .
it actually turned out to be _num_ .
i do n't know how this place is still open .
ah probably cuz it 's the only kfc here in ahwatukee .
also an item was missing from my order .
terrible service thank goodness i do n't go to kfc very often .
waited ten minutes to be greeted at the window , with an apathetic tone .
waited another ten minutes for my food .
no apology , no smile .
lack of urgency for getting orders out .
i 've gone _num_ times and each time they were out of something .
it was _num_ strikes and you 're out .
the service was absolutely horrible .
bad bad bad kfc !
worst location i 've ever been !
it was nothing short of trash worthy .
went inside and when we ordered they were out of almost everything .
had to wait another _num_ minutes to get our food .
not worth the _num_ bucks we just spent here .
rude service .
no apology after yelling at me or anything .
bad service mediocre food .
went through the drive thru and did not get my complete order .
this location was the reason i stopped eating kfc .
never once did she offer to exchange my old product or apologized .
the wo n't sell you just chicken .
wo n't be going back .
fried chicken with no napkins .
this kfc is worst by far .
the old indian guy working there is rude .
fucking disgusting .
tasted old and it was covered in grease .
it was fucking disgusting .
do not go to this place !
_num_ ) the owners daughter was running around and at times yelling or crying .
i returned to star of india last night for the third and final time .
the service is still lousy .
a couple who came in after us was served _num_ minutes before us .
i wo n't be back .
i do n't understand how people can like this place .
our seconds experience we ordered for takeout and not as good .
we were there for at least _num_ hours .
very disappointed about the star of india restaurant , on chandler blvd !
therefore , we decided now , we will definitely not return anymore .
( but looking for a better restaurant in the phoenix metro area . )
the spinach dish was terrible !
the rice desert was not worth mentioning , bland !
the main dishes ran apart when being put on plate . )
but the restaurant itself , including restrooms , are very dirty .
food was mediocre and service was abysmal .
you leave after sitting in a booth for one hour .
food was bland .
chicken tikka masala was flavorless .
not spicy .
samosas were cold on the inside .
my wife and i have been going to this restaurant for about _num_ years .
dry , overcooked , tasteless and of small quantity .
disgusting .
give it a miss .
another _num_ minute wait to look through menu & get drink orders taken .
mediocre at best .
terrible .
i tried the samosas , but again tasteless .
the grilled chicken was dry too .
such a waste of time !
such a disappointment .
staff literally avoided us , waited over a half hour for a table .
Positive
i made this yelp account just to write this negative review .
terrible , avoid at all costs .
really not sure what 's happened to the food here .
the rice was cooked nicely as were the vegetarian portions of the assorted snacks .
however , the chicken in the main dish and appetizer was a real disappointment .
her reaction was ridiculously calm and she did n't seem surprised in the least .
after this her tone changed a bit , but the damage was done .
the owner is rude and clearly they are unsanitary .
such a ripoff !
this pizza is not worth half the price they 're charging for it .
a large cheese thin crust pizza is _num_ bucks .
do yourself a favor and check out sal 's pizza in tempe .
so this is my second time getting pizza from rosati 's delivered .
tonight , we got the thin crust .
it was the same experience .
too much cheese , almost no sauce and it was bland .
this place is slow and the pizza sucks .
she offered garlic bread instead .
alright , i guess .
the garlic bread was hard as a rock and tiny .
super expensive ( $ _num_ with tip ) and poor quality .
the sauce has little garlic flies in it .
i ordered the pan pizza little to no sauce on it .
you should avoid this place at all costs .
yes , it was a friday night , yes they claimed to be busy .
are met with a blank stare and `` i do n't know . ''
get it together , rosati 's .
pizza is n't that complicated of a business .
he could n't find the lady 's pizza order .
the lady sat down to wait , obviously frustrated .
scott told me , `` i 'm going to give her a free pizza .
she responded , `` it 's not too far from where i live .
hey , do n't take my word for this .
make the mistake and find out the hard way , if you insist .
just kidding , just kidding !
but seriously , folks , avoid rosati 's and do yourself a big favor .
believe me , you do n't need the aggravation and spotty food quality .
the roast beef sandwich i ordered was tough .
do n't trust me .
i wish i was back in chicago where i could get good pizza !
one of the worst customer service experiences i have ever received .
used their delivery before and had the exact same problem !
obviously , they have not fixed the problem .
they could n't even get that right .
way too expensive for what we got .
we will not be doing business with rosati 's again .
no explanation no sorry !
the girl insisted i must have called the wrong location by accident .
husband calls me , rosati site still on my computer screen .
really so i 'm a liar again .
this whole business from start to finish lasted _num_ hours and was very upsetting .
horrible customer service !
me : sigh ... .
ok now i have to take time off work no biggie .
at this point i was frustrated and ready to walk out .
after this experience i will gladly take my business elsewhere .
i have no clue why this place has good reviews .
just another way to get more money .
most times i just suck up and deal with any bad experiences .
they adjusted the gas charges to $ _num_ .
this location has me thinking twice about renting from them and enterprise in general .
worst experience ever in renting a car .
horrible customer service .
extremely disappointed with this location !
they just cancelled my reservation at the last minute and said `` sorry '' .
this is very very bad customer service and no way to do business .
they did n't have the meat for the sandwich i ordered .
both my mom 's sandwich and mine was dry and the bread stale .
do not recommend .
long story short : i ate there once i did n't like it .
my coworker ordered me a large fake turkey sub .
your business should too .
anyway , so i listen back to the call and here 's what happened .
instead he basically said too bad so sad .
i was assured that it was absolutely vegan and a _num_ % soy product .
on my last visit i wait _num_ minutes for two sandwiches .
not terribly surprised .
not a fan .
watched _num_ people order after us and get their sandwiches before any of us .
horrible .
i do n't expect that but this was unbelievably slow .
totally overrated ... the subs are nothing special with flavor or quality .
i would n't bother .
worst sandwich i have ever had .
so dry like eating cardboard .
took _num_ bites and threw the rest away .
first time was ok , nothing spectacular but at least the food was decent .
i ordered a turkey sandwich .
i would give this rat hole zero stars if possible .
are you kidding me ?
i was severely underwhelmed and my sandwich was ok at best .
not this time .
tough and dry .
sticky floors , dirty tables , soda area a wreck - yuk !
jesus christ the employees were slow and rude .
of course the food is great but the worst service .
not exactly good first impression i will not be returning to this place .
when i walked in i was overwhelmed by the spell of deep fryer grease .
wo n't waste my money here again .
it used to be one of my favorite - albeit expensive - sandwich shops .
but the changes were n't just with the food .
he did n't hand me my receipt , just walked away .
so really , i had a cole slaw sandwich with a little corned beef .
so very disappointed .
worst sandwich and service i 've ever had at capriotti 's .
i was not impressed with my order .
the fountain drinks had a really odd taste , especially the diet dr. pepper .
for nearly $ _num_ i was expecting something of higher quality .
got so so sick after eating here last night .
it was a horrible experience .
last visits just not the same , obviously .
off to find a new cheese steak place , when i can stomach it .
man , has this place really went downhill .
thank god he wore gloves , but that 's still nasty .
speaking of nasty , the store looks like it 's going to fall apart .
it 's dirty and outdated .
but the last one was nasty and full of gristle .
it 's a shame .

but the last one was nasty and full of gristle .
it 's a shame .
a sandwich shop that does n't have any rolls !
what poor planning and management .
what a shame when a great foodie place goes down hill so fast .
they no longer care about the quality of food like they used too .
no one at the store has any information about how to contact corporate ?
whatever you do , do n't rent from these people .
terrible place .
beware , this is the worst place i 've ever lived .
ca n't wait to move !
i have had over _num_ scorpions in my apartment in _num_ months .
the apartment has sprayed my place twice but it has n't helped at all .
that is my biggest complaint here .
the office also does not care because they are so use to the complaint .
and they never solved that problem .
shady shady shady and unprofessional office staff .
turn over monthly in that place .
do not rent take your money somewhere else .
i apologize but i can not just sit back and get screwed .
this was the worst living experiences my husband and i have ever had .
the office staff is the worst part .
if i could give no stars i would .
the 1st time i went for just a milkshake .
i watched him do it and i immediately asked for my money back .
worst experience ever !
lol for $ _num_ i would hope it would be a little more fresh !
they did give me a napkin , yes , one napkin .
you always expect a little wait going through the drive-thru .
i have visited this place before and they are slower than other places .
drive through quickly at 10:30 in the morning .
not the definition of fast food .
i used _num_ tan and had _num_ left .
i find it totally ridiculous .
needless to say i will never go back there ... .
very disappointing .
not traditional chinese food .
not worth the money .
i was sick .
when i 'm sick i want spicy , hot , asian food .
the rice was overcooked .
steamed rice -- average ... but how could you screw this up ?
way overcooked .
the chicken was extremely dry , and the breading had been burned .
because i got chicken tenders , not chunks .
do n't waste your time or money .
3rd time we 've tried - 3x bad .
one bite & threw out .
ate few pieces of chicken , could n't stomach .
do n't eat here .
i had to spit out several pieces .
( the mongolian beef should have been called mongolian onion . )
sorry , not good at all .
quite bland , watery , dishes .
egg rolls were more spring rolls with thin deep fried paper wrap .
at other chinese places , this is usually less than $ _num_ .
anyway , it went down from there .
i asked for sauce and mayonnaise was brought to the table .
then they billed me $ _num_ for not going back to them .
in my opinion , i would find another dentist office .
very unhappy customer .
the receptionist maria who scheduled my appt was horrible .
i called in , made an appointment .
_num_ days later , phone call comes in , insurance doesnt cover me there .
now they want to charge me .
i refused to pay , she said they would write off the balance .
make another appointment , take more time off .
ranks are questionable at best .
rude rude rude .
avoid this location and its owner .
i am a gold card member and shop a lot here .
however my protein was no longer on sale .
i told the owner that i was in _num_ other times this week .
however i will not tolerate someone calling my a liar .
not here .
no courtesy at all .
the repairs were n't fixed very well either .
apartments are n't renovated do n't let them fool you .
the cherry wood cabinets are just painted brown .
the stains in bathtub are just painted with spray paint .
gates are left open all night long .
this does not appeal to me .
this place has _num_ receptionists and _num_ doctor and is horribly inefficient .
all my experiences have thus far been satisfactory .
horrible .
no thank you .
i will never be back .
horrible customer service .
i could switch my insurance to go here but i wo n't .
the front office staff were rude and very short .
i did really like the physician however .
the new front office people are terrible .
use to love going the before will never go back again .
yay !
a sour cream burrito !
a lettuce burrito to chase a sour cream burrito !
not only that but there are _num_ bites of this incredible cheese burrito !
the 1st bite is cold shredded cheese and the very next is melted cheese !
cold shredded cheese immediately followed by melted cheese !
perhaps one day i will again venture to this taco bell .
one week later , check engine light comes on .
brought my vehicle back to have check engine light looked at once again .
how much , i asked ... $ _num_ .
got truck back , _num_ day later ... check engine light on .
saved $ _num_ .
i will not be going back to fletcher 's again .
no appointment scheduled .
now my car is parked at the curb as if it 's done .
i wait another _num_ minutes .
they just do n't know it yet .
when i left i asked how long he said he did n't know .
then he proceeded to quote me a $ _num_ price .
use this place for my work vehicle , so not expecting perfection .
was n't ready till the following afternoon .
not because they had to order parts , they just never got to it .
appointments do nothing here .
i 'm a car guy , i do n't trust them anymore .
there 's better shops close by , like really close by .
not the place for me though !
ever .
wrong !
ripoff !
regular brakes would have been fine .
so i paid the same price plus the cost of the groupon .
as of today , this is no longer the case !
advised to keep driving and bring back if continues .
oil change , power door on passenger side - having issues with closing .
it became apparent the person behind the counter was a waste of time !
it was evident fletcher 's had made some changes and not for the better !
the coolant was n't going through my car at all !
i was so disappointed when going here .
she insisted i go try on my clothes before giving me an estimate .
not even a `` excuse me for a minute '' .
needless to say i walked out and took my business elsewhere .
do n't waste your time at this place .
this place is a joke and a rip off .
also , you 'll notice there is no chart showing prices .
!
so yeah , i 'm pissed at them .
the service there is hit or miss at best !
food is good service is very poor .
i am not a picky person .
no really !
_num_ minutes after that , my appetizer came out .
in my world , _num_ minutes to wait for your appetizer is pretty bad .
and i 'm not exaggerating .
since i was pretty hungry at that point , the appetizer disappeared quickly .
that is not the case here .
if i go back , i will only pay cash !
a shame because it has so much potential .
we asked for napkins twice to no avail .
bored wait staff , no ambience .
when i said no his response was `` oh good '' .
pretty big portion but at $ _num_ it was a fair price .
they truly do n't deserve it !
well that 's not a good sign !
there were about _num_ tiny meatballs swimming in some marinara .
so we ate , and unfortunately the dish was nothing special .
why was it taking so long ?
what the hell !
and the worst part , it was n't that good .
needless to say we would never come back here .
a big disappointment .
when we arrived it was less than half full at around 6pm .
atmosphere was ordinary , but it appeared that they were professional .
long story short , what a hustle and great disappointment .
i do not suggest supporting this establishment .
?
he made us feel extremely uncomfortable .
wo n't be back .
for food , i think the place is overrated .
not even close .
the vodka sauce was tasty but no lobster chunks there either .
this lobster ravioli was priced around $ _num_ .
was there $ _num_ worth of food there ?
the portion to price ratio is very skimpy .
that 's what got this place _num_ stars .
they indicated that it was reserved and we could not move .
my vegetables that accompanied my dish were mostly just a pile of red onions .
however , my husband enjoyed his stuffed shells .
our first experience , the service was ridiculously slow .
service was still slow , and communication was severely lacking .
i barely ate half and did n't bother taking it to go .
the manager seemed loud and overbearing .
they left even more annoyed than we did .
however , two chances is all i 'm giving .
not impressed .
the portion sizes compared to the price are way off !
sorry , but that 's not really the response we were hoping for .
none of the salads are included with the entrees .
appetizer mediterranean sliders came and were over cooked and dry .
it was accompanied with _num_ yellow soaked pieces of pasta .
my wife and i went there last friday night .
being a cook myself , what i ordered should not have take that long .
but he insisted .
i am really confused about the difference .
we were less than impressed , unfortunately .
the cheese was brown and the chicken was over cooked .
unfortunately , neither one of us were satisfied .
that was n't the waitresses fault !
prices were even higher than what they were .
snow crab is n't even in season .
i 've been using them on and off for about _num_ years .
however , i recently took one of my little angels there .
she never recovered .
no matter how much i felt i could trust them .
it only takes one time , and obviously , you just never know .
the lack of information is incredibly frustrating .
the lack of information and poor service is unacceptable .
do n't waste your time or money !
i have spent thousands of dollars there and got no relief .
very poor customer service and even worse results .
i could not be more disappointed .
terrible !
terrible !
terrible !
i am beginning to believe they are running some sort of scam .
he has zero compassion or desire to actually help his patients .
disappointed in my experience in discount tire over the labor day weekend .
bought _num_ new tires and left the car with them .
the next morning i come out and two tires are completely flat .
so i 'm stuck without my car for _num_ days .
maybe they will make it right , but pretty much ruined my long weekend .
i dropped my car off and asked how long for a tire rotation .
i had such a bad experience i feel compelled to share .
i felt like they totally took advantage of me , being a young woman .
the tech said they could n't even look at for _num_ minutes !
so we had to leave the tire and went back to work .
then they did n't even give me my brand new doughnut back !
but we did n't know which one it was .
so we guessed and they replaced that tire .
their solution was to replace the other front tire at no charge .
came here last friday for a routine rotate and balance .
i was given my keys very quickly and thanked .
do i really have to inspect the car after a simple , routine service ?
truly disappointed .
i 'm always hesitant to get automotive stuff done on my own .
no more `` discount '' tire for me .
i needed _num_ tires and a wheel replaced on my _num_ nissan car .
this is a credit on the tires only , and not any other charges .
looking around , customers are not happy !
plenty of employees , no excuse really .
in short , i followed their process .
it only offers a false sense of security in managing my time .
hence , the the reason i 'm writing this review .
nor did i complain as i could see they were trying their best .
_num_ .
_num_ .
come to find out , the wrong tires were put on my vehicle .
i wasted my day .
never gon na buy tires from this place ever .
should have stayed with costco .
discount would not stand behind their failed work .
it took _num_ min for them to pull my truck into the bay .
what good is the appointment if it 's not honored .
does anyone expect a lot from a chinese buffet ?
sigh , i do n't even know where to begin .
not terribly appetizing and the final product is as lackluster as you 'd expect .
the place is also starting to look tired and worn .
this place was just half ass .
$ _num_ per person and it does n't even include a drink is awful .
the crab legs were tiny and did n't have much taste .
none of the food was above _num_ degrees as it should be .
i had a plate of cold food every time .
such a waste of money .
came for lunch , and found the chinese food to be mediocre at best .
i also tried the sesame chicken , mongolian beef and sweet and sour pork .
i also was n't thrilled that the manger did n't come over .
after reading all of the stellar reviews , i was expecting stellar .
made to order sushi `` all u can eat '' bar .
mediocre buffet items .
do n't order brown rice on your sushi , it tasted _num_ days old !
meh , i have had way better !
cold food ( that should be hot ) is the main problem .
service staff seemed quite disinterested in actually providing service .
i would much rather to to pacific seafood buffet for the same price .
wife and i did n't feel the best for a few days after .
probably had forgotten why .
not good !
the last time i went , everything tasted old .
from the egg foo young , to the orange and sesame chicken .
no thanks !
it is a shame that all were so bland .
i will not be back .
there was a very small variety of food -- everything was stale and cold .
the clams and crab were flavorless .
we were very disappointed .
however , compliments to the waiter , who was very friendly .
this review is not in regards to the food .
i have been several times and nope it sucks .
the meat taste strange , i mean real strange .
nothing gourmet here , greasy fried food .
save your money and go elsewhere .
not surprised that this place was n't impressive .
the food was cold or dry and stale .
the salmon sushi had a weird taste to it .
_num_ persons $ _num_ .
horrible food !
i walk in and manager ( owner ) greets me .
then , he comes back .
then he leaves .
then ... he comes back .
i take a couple of bites of food , but am too distracted .
i decide i want no part if this scene .
i have only taken a few bites and i owe them nothing .
i tell them to calm down and it 's not worth it .
just then my waitress comes out and asks if i am going to pay .
that was not a good scene and i barely touched food .
he says i wasted food .
if this is how they operate i do not recommend choosing hong kong gourmet .
nothing special about this place .
i tried this place many years ago and it used to be pretty good .
the prime rib was so tough i could n't chew it !
i will not go back and would n't recommend to anyone .
i asked her about the place and tells me it is located in chandler .
most of it was horrible !
soggy and runny with water dripping out from everywhere .
it just left a tasteless oily feel to my lips .
everything else was hardly fresh and not good tasting at all .
and another disgusting dish that i saw that they served were frog legs .
gross !
no thanks !
disgusting !
lastly and overall , very expensive for low quality cold and old food !
never again are we going back.
the hot food is reasonably warm , but not that warm .
food quality is questionable .
too expensive for what you get .
we wo n't be going back .
the food was cold and the trays were almost empty .
very disappointed in quality of food .
not a good selection of food .
the place was almost empty and it was lunch time .
stay away and find some other place .
we ate over half our meals without any refills .
it was barely room temperature .
he advised the waitress of this who got the manager .
do n't want food poisoning ?
do n't go to hong kong !
avoid !
we went there last night and it was terrible .
everyone got sick and could n't stomach what we ate .
the food was obviously left out for some time .
we will never return here again .
service is poor !
_num_ minutes went by and we were not even greeted yet .
smelled delicious and there was people eating in the dinning area .
we have gone here multiple times but this last time was n't spectacular .
he asked me , `` california roll and crab roll ? ''
i replied , `` no , california roll and new jersey roll '' .
overly priced , mediocre food .
save your $ _num_ for food and $ _num_ for drinks .
horrible service , i would absolutely not recommend anyone eating at this place !
worst buffet i 've ever been to !
the rice was bland and noodles were starting to dry out .
i 've been going to hong kong gourmet buffet for over a decade .
in the past year , i 've eaten here _num_ times .
i have n't said anything about it , until now .
their food just looks like its been sitting there all day .
it does n't make sense .
you 're probably wondering if they adjusted the prices accordingly .
they refilled the shrimp tempura one time .
they did n't even have any and pepper shrimp .
they did n't have oysters .
( mostly because they refuse to really listen to my initial explanation . )
the food here is of very cheap quality .
very limited selection for the mongolian bbq .
the food on the buffet was lukewarm .
the food was chewy and just bad overall .
very disappointing .
very disappointing .
i left merchandise on counter and walked out .
ca n't price match your own website ?
they use scare tactics to get women to pay for services not needed .
these people have no conscious !
stay away for any significant service work .
Negative
if i could give zero or negative stars i would .
i 've had extremely similar experiences as the other disappointed reviewers .
wrong again .
totally unnecessary .
screw all these guys , so dishonest .
will not go back ever .
this is a horrible starbucks !
they consistently mess up and do n't compensate for it .
it 's very disappointing because we love starbucks !
it took _num_ minutes to get our drinks !
have only been here once before but it was fine .
not only did she laugh at me , but was not helpful .
no suggestion for something else , like what ?
rude !
worst starbucks service in the general area .
the location is beyond slow inside or through the drive through .
if you can avoid this location , do it .
the coffee tasted like cheap , burnt beans .
really disappointed with this starbucks .
it seems to have gone downhill in the past few months .
the service is quite slow , even with many people working .
customer service is extremely lacking .
orders are often wrong .
apologies seem to be in short supply , also .
this girl needs some serious customer service training .
please ensure drinks are n't sitting for close to ten minutes .
a disappointment today .
that 's why i asked what you needed .
no apology , nothing .
i left highly annoying .
i really should n't be annoyed over coffee , but i am .
even if you do n't care about customer service- at least pretend to care .
it takes _num_ seconds to pour .
worst .
it seems like customer service is not important here .
i 've been both greeted poorly and ignored by some baristas here .
it was disgusting .
it was exactly what it looked like watered down milk !
that is why i do n't like about that location because of slowest service .
we thought they were closed because the parking lot was rather empty .
she did , in no way rude at all .
really , just disgusting .
after tonight , f -- - del taco !
avoid at all costs .
never seen this before in a restaurant , ever .
left immediately and will not be back .
zero stars .
cheese on half of my nachos , cold fries , etc .
i may not be back !
Neutral
the middle aged lady that works the drive thru always has a negative attitude .
_num_ thumbs down , i 'm going to taco bell for now on .
zero stars !
that annoyed us so we said never mind .
worst customer service ever !
no other options , just wait until i ca n't stand it anymore .
went to another foot dr. for a second option .
the service is slow and grumpy .
the pizza is thin and chewy and way overpriced .
the rest of the menu is small portions and , again , way overpriced .
nothing special tasting about anything served here either .
just like the brick they put in my stomach .
let me first say that i hate to give bad reviews to nice people .
however in this case i must , if i am to tell the truth .
too much time between making the salad and service .
i hate when i pay for something that is wilted .
first , i like crusty italian bread , this bread was soft .
just ordered a margherita pizza , large salad and large cannoli .
my husband and i could not finish anything .
the service was not that friendly .
it 's sad that we have n't found a great pizza in ahwatukee yet .
wanted to try because of all the great reviews but sadly a little disappointed .
service was really great but unfortunately the food was mediocre .
went there for dinner on a recommendation and were really let down .
the meatballs tasted as if they were frozen .
the pizza crust lacked flavor but was crunchy .
bad !
not a fan .
basically , this is mall food court quality stuff .
absolutely not _num_ stars .
food here was bland .
save yourself the time and frustration of going to this office !
this will come back to bite me , hard .
i was in pain so i was like `` whatever . ''
i was also only given pain medication for _num_ days .
i would n't advise my worst enemy to go to this practice .
the problem is no one takes the time to report these things .
worst service ever .
the 4th time she tells us the appt was written down for 11:30 .
they did n't try to get us in early they are just ridiculous .
billing office was a complete nightmare .
this is where the trouble starts .
thats not the end of the office staffs behavior though .
my experience was horrible .
he did not even refer me out to another doctor for help .
i will never recommend this facility nor this doctor to anyone .
my opinion : do not waste your time going to this place .
several doctors have not figured it out , either . ''
he looked at his watch and the visit was over .
please do not go to see this doctor .
it will be a waste of your time and money .
horrible customer service , they made an appointment for my son .
i am not going back there .
this is the worst doctor office i have ever been in .
or they might get offended , but i am sorry .
this should not be this way .
they wo n't call me back ever .
why would they ignore me like this .
they dropped the ball this year with me & it was the last straw .
it 's not like i can call them up & tell them or anything .
i had the sleep study done on january _num_ , _num_ .
it just makes me remember how bad they are .
as for these guys , i wish i could give a zero star rating .
but this place is huge , and there was no wait at all .
wo n't go back - there are better breakfast places in ahwatukee .
i have noticed that lately the food and service are getting worse and worse .
seems each time we go it gets worse and that is all locations .
service was great , but the food was definitely lackluster .
i ordered breakfast , which was just alright .
gross .
i abandoned them after a couple of bites .
being they were so bust service was slow .
thinking he was just being difficult , i said he had to eat it .
i watched him gag through another bite and realized something was wrong .
my husband then looked at it and smelled it and the ham was bad .
i mean really bad like off color and smelled rotten .
that could make someone really sick .
i was shocked and really worried about my son getting sick .
i am not sure how this could happen .
how does bad food get out of the kitchen ?
this cracker barrel 's food was lackluster , at best .
the food was n't even particularly hot .
the grits were absolutely disgusting and an embarrassment to have been served .
the toast was not toasted completely .
not worth the time it takes to park and get through the gift shop .
for years ive been hearing how great this place is ... wth ?
what a disappointment !
food was luke warm to cold , bland and just yucky .
maybe lunch would be better ?
never again .
catfish was not fully cooked , it was raw in the middle .
coleslaw was blah .
what a waste of time and money .
the waitress could care less .
wendy 's has a sour cream and baked potato for a buck .
the salad was small and had lettuce , tomato and that 's it .
no onion , etc or anything - plain .
my total bill for my plate was _num_ dollars .
if your grandparents are in town , then they will probably like cracker barrel .
very bland menu .
my waitress was a little odd and really seemed unorganized with her tables .
it 's cheap but really not what i had expected from cracker barrel .
worst breakfast i have ever had .
ordered biscuits and gravy with sausage .
was not breakfast sausage but some dry beef stick .
went in tonight for the turkey dinner , and chicken fried steak .
chicken fried steak was `` soggy '' , and tasted horrible .
_num_ turkey dinners , and both dishes were served cold .
i will not ever consider going to this place again .
i have no clue why people this this place was good .
i know this is not disneyland !
cornbread normally has a little bit of sweetness but this did not at all .
it was absolutely ridiculous .
that was an insult .
i guess if i had just started going there i would rate it higher .
it 's not anything like it use to be .
i like my scrambled eggs done .
wo n't be going back anymore .
not so good .
once we were seated , we were rushed through our breakfast .
the quality of the food was poor ... greasy and undercooked .
the atmosphere is that of a very noisy cafeteria .
certainly , there are better places for breakfast .
unfortunately i ordered a grilled chicken salad and my chicken was raw .
the waitress really did n't seem to think it was an issue .
raw chicken is serious .
my visit to this establishment was n't pleasant .
the kitchen was also slow today .
my last visit here was much more pleasant than tonight .
it was unacceptable , almost to the point of making me sick !
just ca n't do it .
now , for the minus _num_ stars part .
what job out there does n't fit that bill !
but the more i shop at this albertsons , the more i despise it .
albertsons is my closest grocery store .
they do n't sell your information .
gross !
that 's probably an accident and a fluke , right ?
truly disgusting .
i am a _num_ year old white christian with a bad back .
we had a terrible time a year or so ago .
certificate to show their concern .
eh .
the burger was lacking excitement .
bland was the theme of the day here .
the place was dirty and poorly kept .
i do not think i will eat another fatburger ever again .
i 'm not sure entirely what was going on here .
the food was not good .
my burger was a giant sloppy mess thrown all together .
how can a burger be done so wrong ?
it needed to close , this one was bad .
i happily went to the scottsdale quarter and they honored the sale for me .
i wo n't be sending my princess here no longer .
the director is so rude !
she always makes unnecessary comments .
left my # every time .
gave no explanation , perhaps someone there planned to take it ( ? )
i had the receipt and requested a price adjustment .
for someone who shops here regularly , i was quite disappointed .
this is the worst of them .
i do not know if it was an off night or what .
_num_ .
ordered drinks , no problem .
_num_ .
_num_ .
we ordered our pizzas and was informed it is a _num_ min wait .
not once a manager stopped by to check our visit .
no coming back to this location again .
however , it was at least _num_ mins .
probably _num_ mins later our waiter came with our drinks finally .
when i saw how big they were , i was kinda surprised .
but i ca n't fault the waiter for that .
my son 's however was really yummy .
the server was so terrible i can hardly remember the food experience .
failed to clean our table as we finished appetizers and our main course .
the brownie dessert was a major fail , the brownie was too hard .
food here is mediocre and tastes super artificial .
the decoration of cpk is okay but it kind of feels like an ihop .
wo n't be back .
where are my caramelized peaches ?
i sat , i ate , i felt disappointed and angry .
they sent me a coupon for a free salad , that was nice .
i just had another terrible experience at this cpk .
the server did n't even take our drink order for _num_ min .
i even gave him one last chance by telling him that we were unhappy .
it was hard for me to tell through the bitter taste in my mouth .
was there a shortage of bbq sauce today ?
first of all , the waitress never offered me any bread .
no biggie .
overall , it was a pretty bad meal .
this has to be the worst place i 've eaten a long long time .
the food was at best bland .
worst service ever .
not sure why this location is consistently bad with regard to service .
i 'm rating this place based on the last waiter we had .
horrific service .
i usually tip _num_ to _num_ percent .
so hats off to you !
bathrooms are extremely disgusting .
smelly , dirty ... just gross all around .
the gluten free crust is horrible .
if you ca n't do it right , do n't offer a gf alternative .
worst service ever !
i have had bad luck at this place every time .
never going back ... if you have a cheese allergy , beware !
then they gave me another bad order .
skip the free burrito and head to baja fresh for a way better meal .
then things started going downhill .
the fish tacos -- -they tasted very , very , very fishy .
in fact , i started to worry that maybe the fish had gone bad .
so , like i said , maybe ... maybe not .
but this location always smells like raw sewage inside .
it is disgusting .
nobody wants to eat at a place that smells like that .
it is an on again off again situation .
stopped by today and picked up a fish and chicken taco .
the fish taco was good , but the chicken taco was really sloppy .
this place was not good tonight for several reasons .
there was salsa all over the seating , really the interior needs a facelift .
they could n't get the orders straight , even with numbers !
i find this annoying .
i guess i 'm better off doing them by myself at home .
he responded with $ _num_ .
when i arrived he greeted me as `` one who called '' .
so , $ _num_ i paid .
people are not as friendly as some other places .
it was extremely crowded , which is annoying , but a good sign .
i got the gel manicure and the spa pedi .
this is not supposed to happen .
if you go here get a regular manicure not gel .
spent the rest of my trip with ugly chipped nails .
i will not make the mistake of going here again .
ugh , i 'm upset .
i do n't even want to give this shop one star !
if you can , avoid this shop and spend your money elsewhere !
worst manicure ever , chipped the next day .
none of my nails were the same shape .
never going back .
too many other nail places to go to that will be better than this .
so the cash only demand for tips is lame and tacky and probably illegal .
i had no cash on me so it put me in a weird spot .
when you are providing a service to someone , stay off the phone .
when i first went in , the lady who greeted me was super friendly .
which i must say caused an awkward moment .
i would n't return for services .
went in today for a nail polish application , had no polish on .
worst experience ever .
i had cindy , she may be the owner .
other than that the place was empty .
i will never return and i would tell a friend to stay away .
ugh .
i do n't like ulta and i am especially annoyed with this location .
the layout is terrible and they are always out of everything !
too bad it 's so close to my house .
( except for the lack of selection ! )
slow check out as well !
makeup staff is rude .
i was not thrilled with my recent salon experience at ulta .
i scheduled an appointment with jen for a haircut .
i was trying something new , and getting bangs .
that is not what i got .
too bad i was told this after my hair was already cut .
i went to ulta salon because i wanted a cheaper decent haircut .
i got one of the worst haircuts i have ever received .
too many layers on the right , on the left it looked ok .
the problem is that they can never seem to clean my clothes fast .
is n't that what people always do ?
nothing special , just a normal hem on a normal pair of pants .
i wo n't be going here again , for alterations or dry cleaning .
i would like to give desert ridge cleaners _num_ stars .
not only is it extremely expensive , but the tailor screwed up my alterations .
i have never seen this before before and i get all my pants hemmed .
do n't go here - they are rude and do a horrible job .
worst dry cleaners in the valley !
i will never use desert ridge cleaners again .
they have lost another pair of pants .
i will never use this cleaners again .
and the tailor is n't in on weekends .
i 'm not sure if they even deserve one star !
i will never go back to this place again .
avoid at all costs .
terrible customer service- calls never returned .
avoid !
avoid !
avoid !
also , they advertise `` same day dry cleaning '' .
bad service with poor tailoring .
too much trouble !
`` we will call you '' .
i 've been a customer for more than almost _num_ years .
there is too much competition in the area for this kind of sloppy service .
the bread maybe is a little old but i am not for sure .
the service was n't all that great either .
quantity - here 's where they really fall behind .
for desert ridge i would suggest another place .
not going back .
i am never going back .
he then proceeded to make my sandwich with the same gloves .
it disgusted me .
these kids are clueless and have no idea about quality control .
how this kid can pass inspection and be hired is beyond me .
how could management not see that .
there smoothie tastes like crap .
all they put in it was yogurt and a few strawberries for $ _num_ !
this was not my first time getting crappy service .
not to mention what sub shop runs out of turkey on a sunday ?
terrible .
not good service .
no sense of urgency whatsoever .
so why my tiny sandwich was _num_ , i wo n't know .
will not be back .
this place is gross .
bland tasteless meat , mushy vegetables , plain bread .
there 's too many other sub shops to come back .
i will not be back .
the crew starts closing at _num_ when they close _num_ to _num_ .
hate not getting any selection at this time .
the portions are very short and just not fresh .
terrible experience .
walked in and there were only three tables with customers .
the floor was just as bad .
and there were more employees than customers in the store .
most likely the worst panda i 've ever been in .
the food was hot but did n't seem fresh .
trash cans overflowing .
i was disgusted and walked out with my two daughters .
if i could give zero stars i would .
the worst customer service ever .
i spend a lot of money online and in the store .
i went into buy bras but could not find my size .
there were _num_ girls working and me in the store .
no one helped me or asked if they could find me a different style .
they never acknowledged me .
worst experience ever .
horrible customer service , i was never greeted .
all paradise bakeries are busy !
have no fear , once the food is served , you quickly remember .
i ordered a croissant breakfast sandwich - no ham , and a medium coffee .
what is wrong with you paradise ?
why would you stick a huge slab of tough ham inside a croissant .
a croissant that was n't even toasted .
you have no clue how to make anything .
you clearly ca n't think this food is good ?
easily the worst experience i have ever had at paradise bakery .
went here for lunch with my husband and _num_ year old .
placed our order and then proceeded to wait _num_ minutes to get our food .
hands down the worst paradise bakery in arizona .
the food sucks , very unorganized , ran by a bunch of kids .
so bad , and i love paradise bakery .
dry cookies , wet bread , dirty tables , rude rude employees .
avoid this place .
so sad because i love paradise and like to visit others often .
it is the worst paradise bakery in maricopa county .
they use paper plates and bowls rather than real dishes .
three people at the cash register and only one person making the actual orders .
edible but so stale and chewy .
i finally asked for another cashier and they brought out an equally old cashier .
i 'm sorry but when you are busy then you need quick cashiers .
it was painfully slow .
the only reason i stayed is because i wanted a cookie .
it 's so bad , i wo n't be eating there again .
but now my visits have been disappointing .
no complaints there .
i love paradise bakery but this location is terrible .
i would not recommend this location when you are wanting to go to paradise .
staff is not great , to say the least .
they are not accommodating .
i was very disappointed .
worst coffee i 've literally ever had ever .
and whoever is baking for them needs to take some culinary classes .
we ordered _num_ sandwich , _num_ soup and _num_ half sandwich half salad .
they left out the soup and half sandwich as well as the cookies .
so we paid _num_ for a sandwich and half salad .
ordered the tuna .
was told there 's no option not to get a cookie .
really , not even a carrot stick ?
did n't get it .
the tuna was watery brown mayonnaise goo .
the ordering setup for this place is extremely awkward .
that may be why my order got messed up yet again .
floors are dirty , the young staff lose focus and are non energetic .
this location does not have the standards as other locations nearby .
needless to say i did not make a purchase .
as i expected the rib rack would n't fit in my smoker .
the same sales representative that i purchased my products from earlier .
god these guys are so rude .
matt was beyond rude and unhelpful .
showed the salesman a picture of the item that they were selling .
however , there hours are great !
more money for my dogs .
i took my puppy on april _num_ , _num_ .
one leg was groomed the other three were not .
top of head was halfway done .
i complained to the manager of the salon and she could care less .
was too busy to be bothered with me .
this was my dogs 4th visit and now the last .
check out clerks seem unhappy .
so yeah , petsmart should n't be able to even sell living things .
worst grooming experience ever .
may be he smelled less than he was before grooming .
i am definitely not going back there for grooming .
this location for dog grooming is horrible !
the groomers here are super inexperienced .
because the dog groomers here are lazy !
do not get your dog groomed here .
the groomers are inexperienced and do n't know what they are doing .
she completely understood my concerns & gave me a refund .
fair warning , do not go here .
my boyfriend does a better job & does n't do this for living .
no mention was made of this absurd charge prior to printing .
she never spoke to me or made any eye contact .
the server was nice but just left us with empty pop for a while .
my fish tacos had room temp .
this place is essentially a jimmy buffett themed tgi fridays .
and i do n't mean that as a compliment .
i split the quesadillas as an appetizer and they were n't good .
there was some sort of pepper relish in them that added a weird flavor .
but overall , i thought this place was cheesy and pretty mediocre .
i am not exaggerating .
i ordered a chicken sandwich instead , which was awful .
i will not be going back to any islands ' restaurants again .
there was half of a dead fly in my greek salad .
disgusting .
i 'd probably regret drinking that much anywhere else .
but no , the drinks were just weak and gross .
what a joke .
fries greasy and customer service poor .
unfortunately , island is n't up with the times .
it was more like a mini slider so definitely not filling .
food was barely warm and flavorless .
it was fairly disappointing ... .
not very flavorful at all .
nothing like i remember .
i tried a burger too ... definitely not as delish as it was expensive .
i probably would n't return .
how disappointing .
another group of _num_ people came in after us , put their name in .
it just looks picked over and sad .
if you 're a guy , do n't even bother walking through the doors .
it feels like the men 's department is just set up as a courtesy .
i can only recommend ross as a desperate last resort .
the employees are rude and it is always a mess .
america is fee 'd to death by businesses like verizon and banks .
their $ _num_ loyalty credit in confusing as well .
fees like an upgrade fee does n't give you a positive .
money is n't everything in this world .
worst sales reps ever .
this location gets worse and worse .
verizon store reps used to be helpful .
my phone quit , thought maybe it was the battery .
they said `` we have no batteries .
they then suggested i go to batteries plus .
anyway , i called verizon .
why could n't the employees at desert ridge do this ?
sorry they tell me , we do n't stock batteries in the store anymore .
i wish i could give zero star to this terrible verizon store .
one star is even too much .
this is the worst experience i have ever had with any company .
the rep was _num_ times worse than car salesmen .
i wish i could give _num_ star to this terrible verizon store .
one star is even too much .
this is the worst experience i have ever had with any company .
he was a poor excuse for a manager and should lose his job !
never been treated so bad !
this place does n't receive a star .
called the customer service line and could n't find my order .
he was extremely rude and hung up .
now my phone is coming _num_ weeks later than before .
do n't have very good customer service and do n't care .
spent a good _num_ hours on on little mistake .
my moms phone just would n't turn on this morning .
if the store employee missed up on upgrading your device ( craig ) .
and the store manger could n't fix that day .
but i guess not .
do not shop at this store if you value your time .
my iphone _num_ did not work so i took it in .
the people helping me did n't get that .
every time i walked back to my car it would n't work correctly .
i also had to prove i was over _num_ .
went into the store a month ago because my phone was n't working .
i spent over two hours waiting for my phone to wipe .
terrible customer service .
horrible experience .
had an unbelievable experience here .
i was there to upgrade _num_ phone as well .
i hate verizon stores .
i almost cancelled my service thanks to the awful experience at this store .
i wish i could give this store _num_ stars !
it was insulting .
seriously the most frustrating experience i 've ever had with a verizon .
do not go here and do not trust eric !
go anywhere else and do not listen to eric .
i would give this store zero stars if i could .
horrible customer service .
i placed an order for _num_ items on april 9th .
on may 10th i get an e-mail stating my order has shipped .
our waitress was slow as hell .
rock bottom is the reason that i 'm not big on chains .
... especially considering they 're not all that great .
the food was decent , no real complaints there ... but nothing stellar .
food is average service is not do good .
rating _num_ and half .
mac and cheese was alright , i have had better .
not worth the price of our meal .
_num_ of us ordered drinks and i ordered sweets .
it is gross .
so gross !
we had the pretzels to start , which were really good .
the red onion overwhelmed the salad .
rock bottom is just not the place to spend money on food .
waited _num_ mins for service then left .
the food is a tad better than okay .
the service is somewhat mixed , it depends who you get for the evening .
something 's wrong here .
atmosphere is half the rent .
nothing stands out at this pub eatery .
at least the prices were not outrageous .
i will not be returning .
this is place used to have the best beer in town .
slow service .
burgers and fries just do n't taste the way they used to .
they 're gross now and taste frozen .
will not go back !
the food was n't great by any stretch of the imagination .
i have never been treated so rudely .
food mediocre at best and service was awful .
unfortunately it also cost you over $ _num_ if you want anything really done .
walk away .
worst customer service ever in the store .
ick .
wings , burgers , chicken , french fries .
another chain restaurant with standard , dull american food .
so we thought why not .
the chicken on the the pasta was not fresh tasted like cardboard .
will not be going back .
the manager was going around apologizing for delays .
we could n't leave till 8:30 pm .
he processed our bill and came back .
the coupon was not applied so we flagged him down again .
no , no , and no .
the coupon was applied but he had forgotten _num_ of our credit cards .
`` wow , that looks bad does n't it ? ''
no comment , dead silence .
i had a bad experience and it was rather disappointing .
would not go back for a long time .
staff is messing around , watching tv , chatting with friends , etc .
i have never seen a tgi friday 's run so horribly !
really not appetizing and we all left hungry .
oh , and on top of everything , the place was freezing !
overall , this is a very poorly run restaurant with very poor service .
big mistake .
_num_ o'clock and they were packed !
i could n't believe it .
after getting our drinks , we ordered some guacamole and chips as our appetizer .
i got the bruschetta chicken pasta but asked for shrimp instead of chicken .
i do n't do dairy , so asked for no cheese .
waitress said no problem .
sent it back because i ca n't eat cheese .
she brought the new pasta , it was ice cold .
then she took back the shrimp and left the pasta !
moms steak was served in a pool of butter and grease .
some of her fries were wet and mushy from the butter .
nothing special .
we used a coupon buy one get on free .
it was ridiculous .
this experience should have been better .
there was a very limited selection which was disappointing .
this restaurant really should not exist .
looking annoyed it was taking us so long .
but you have too many .
unacceptable !
do yourself a favor , do n't even walk into this store !
Neutral
if i could give this place negative stars i would !
the store is super disorganized , and the employees are flat out rude .
i was very displeased with the size selections .
you could tell he could n't care less about working there .
if i could give it zero stars i would .
horrible selection , never has my size .
manager was rude and not helpful .
i found it very rude and disrespectful .
i could n't complain to the manager because she was the manager .
also none of the other staff members asked if i needed help .
terrible staff .
this place is over priced anyway , save your money .
ugh .
sauce did n't mix well with the pasta either .
the texture of the pasta was funky , hanging out on its own .
the server was attentive enough to notice and brought me more sauce .
appetizer : calamari was yummy .
this used to be one of my favorite places .
also the salad is n't great .
and everything else is only fair .
sad really .
the service was slow at best on a not very busy night .
i had the italian trio sampler which was bland .
the dinner was a disaster .
the salad had barely any dressing on it , and was quite bland .
i ordered chicken , garlic , broccoli , spinach , and marinara .
all of the food was bland and of poor quality .
this it third time i have tried this location .
my son ordered fettuccine alfredo with chicken .
my son 's fettuccine alfredo showed up sans chicken .
however , this is the third time .
i am beginning to wonder about the management here .
it feels too fast food .
i will have to go back to the one on gold dust .
the food is mediocre .
my husband said we should tip anyways so we tipped _num_ % .
!
but this evening was a disaster .
and yes !
needless to say , we wo n't be back to this location .
i looked around and the bartenders were waiting on other tables .
it looked like there were only _num_ waitresses in the entire restaurant .
why would any restaurant put pepper all over someone 's food ?
none at all .
the pasta , however was completely different than i remember it .
fake chicken ?
bland pasta sauce ?
bland bread ?
not what i remembered from this place .
what a disappointing birthday dinner .
no problem , so we sat in the waiting area with the others .
the food was terrible too .
my friend ordered this and substituted with penne pasta instead .
this was a disappointing item .
the service this time was n't very good .
paying for the bill took forever as well .
service i wish would be more consistent .
actually worse than awful .
took me _num_ minutes to get somebody to ring me out .
getting cold .
i wo n't be back .
i most definitely thought wrong !
overall , i will never go to that restaurant again .
shame .
i was disappointed in the bread -- cold and dry .
it was `` too late '' for good bread , i guess .
when the bill came , she had indeed forgotten the separate bill request .
i was disappointed in our evening out .
first off the service was horrendous and the food not that good .
at least not the one at desert ridge .
which ill get to more in a minute .
he had a confused look on his face and walked off .
also this entire time we have empty glasses .
the chicken was like chewing a piece of rubber .
the food was awful .
my daughters chicken was so overcooked she could not cut it .
will never go back to this location again .
i was here with my husband , and this place was a joke .
truly disappointing .
i told her i was n't sure about wine but really needed water .
she finally poured some into the little glasses they use for wine .
no ice .
prosciutto is typically sliced very thin .
the server blamed the waitress , who said they were all out of bowls .
glad i did n't pay for this meal with my own dollars .
by far the worst experience at macaroni grill that we 've ever had .
the excuse from the hostess was they were waiting for more staff to come .
i am extremely disappointed because i like the menu .
i can only question : are they understaffed ?
Negative
if i could give negative stars , i would !
one of the worst dining experiences i have had in a long time !
do they not realize that they are open to the dining area ?
are you stupid ?
is this supposed to be funny ?
they were pitiful containers too .
could not get out if there fast enough .
no one needs to put up with this .
no one said anything about my food taking too long .
would feel like a jerk asking for $ _num_ back anyway .
Negative
i too would give this place negative stars .
although the waitress was nice , the service was extremely slow .
my grilled chicken was swimming in grease .
ok super horrible service !
and here is where it all went to hell !
this by far was the worse service experience of my life !
wrong .
took _num_ hours for the dinner and we ordered promptly .
the place was very dead !
they seemed busy but did not get anything done .
but , the long time it took was unreal .
mediocre food .
mediocre service .
no need to return for overpriced , chain food .
he was very unsure of himself and it showed .
when we finally got out food it tasted old and rubbery .
what a disaster !
gross .
Negative
i 'd give it negative stars if possible .
she was really in the mood for spaghetti and ordered spaghetti and meatballs .
i started laughing and said she surely must be exaggerating .
she did not finish it .
it was decent but lacked any depth .
the bruschetta appetizer was also decent however they gave me mostly burned bruschetta bread .
they could n't even do that right .
the baked prosciutto & mozzarella was disgusting .
i tasted rotten - literally .
not sure what executive chef runs this kitchen and what their standards are .
i tried the mama 's trio which was extremely disappointing .
we were rushed through the entire beginning of our meal .
then , we waited about _num_ minutes before getting the bill .
parmesan crusted chicken salad should have never been delivered to customer .
chicken was so dark looked next almost burned , let alone terribly dry .
wait another five minutes to ask for silverware .
it 's covered in mushrooms , which i 'm allergic to .
.
pasta cooked correctly , but the `` meat sauce '' was greasy .
and the meatballs were reminiscent of frozen cocktail balls in my opinion .
and this was not even close .
i said yes , since it was only $ _num_ so why not .
this is wine not tang .
too little too late .
the bathrooms were filthy and the service was abysmal .
the entire experience was disappointing .
our entrees came out approximately three minutes after we received our salads .
the restaurant does not appear to be well managed at all .
overall it was a terrible experience and the food is sub-par at best .
i would n't recommend this location .
it was a disaster .
most of the other reviews will support my experience .
do n't waste your time or cash here .
there are many other choices if you 're looking for fake italian food .
the next morning i put the skirt on and carefully took off the tag .
she told me there was still nothing she could do for me .
the staff there is unprofessional .
i was unable to get my exam completed because of that .
terrible representation of a good company and doctor by the staff .
she cut too far back and too far to the sides .
i am so upset and do not recommend this place .
walked in and went to the register to ask a question .
my question was sincere and it was answered with a terrible attitude .
terrible ... will never go back !
i wo n't be back .
i really do n't understand what the big deal is about this place .
not the worst , not the best .
i just do n't get it .
to me , the burger tasted like a somewhat better `` big mac . ''
i am constantly disappointed with the food quality .
the burgers are sloppy and not stacked correctly .
ugh .
the burger was ok ( ordered animal style ) nothing special .
the fries were horrible .
dry and tough and tasteless .
even wendy 's or burger king fries are better .
will not go back .
the animal fries were done too early and came out cold .
should not be a _num_ minute ordeal to go through drive thru .
the staff showed little care for their product .
very little customer service .
not impressed .
she did n't have enough respect to address me in the proper manner .
i do not care to go there and be treated with such disrespect .
shame on them for this happening so often !
were empty .
the bagels themselves were fine , as was the cream cheese .
my iced latte tasted like coffee grounds .
i wish i had spent $ _num_ elsewhere .
do n't know why i continue to go to einstein .
i keep searching for something healthy on the menu but can not find it .
i ordered a turkey sandwich on a thin bagel .
this one is the worst .
he finally gave me my bagel and i left .
the staff is run horribly .
the staff was all wearing dirty shirts .
my wife and i will not be coming back .
horrible service .
the staff was rude and could n't have cared less about customer service .
weekend mornings are a nightmare here , also they frequently run out of things .
a long line at an einstein is to be expected on a saturday morning .
horrible service .
it 's no complicated to read an order when making a sandwich .
i 'm still standing here waiting for the food i just paid for .
bagels were dry , even for bagels , on both my bagel sandwiches .
it 's as if the staff have no training .
sooooo slow .
cashier would rather chat than move along the line .
i wo n't be back .
terrible customer service !
no apology ; no offer to correct the order ; nothing .
that is not acceptable .
the service today , however , was sub par .
the girl who took my payment did n't greet me .
she did not offer me a receipt .
they did not thank me or offer me a bag for my order .
i am very disappointed in the service i received today .
stick to starbucks or dutch bros if you want quality coffee .
the bacon was really gross .
what a disappointment .
3rd back to the server and service or lack there of .
she then turned and rushed to get a new receipt .
no thank you nothing , rude !
this check was charging me for _num_ eggs , i got _num_ eggs .
then she charged me for the steak breakfast plus an ala carte chicken breast !
_num_ later i am searching for a manager .
the manager was n't doing much better in the service department .
bad bad bad !
i was wrong !
it was n't even that busy .
never had anything bad here .
needless to say it was n't ready .
cheap as can be .
the coffee is terrible , the food is as average as could be .
walked in looked like a senior center .
tables and chairs were very out dated .
we sat down in a booth .
waitress came over after _num_ min and asked what we wanted to drink .
_num_ min later she brought out or coffee .
placed the order waited another _num_ min to get the food .
the diner was n't busy at all .
i do n't know why the wait was so long .
the food was ok , service was horrible .
i showed the waitress and she really did n't care .
gross !
i sent all the food back .
sad thing is , he is the manager on duty .
both burgers were charred too much and tasted like they were burnt .
the fries were cold and our service was absolutely horrible !
the fish itself was nice but the coating was horrible .
she walked passed me like four times !
while their food was good , they sure did skimp on the quantity .
this place failed in my book .
this is the worst car wash i have ever gone to !
if you want a real car wash do n't come to this place .
do n't waste your money !
you get _num_ star for your store being clean .
clerks behind the counter and _num_ register running .
i will try to avoid this place as much as i can .
do not go for a car wash or a oil change .
i do n't even know why i tipped them shame on me !
i do n't know how they stay in business .
they kept pushing me to add all these extras .
the bathrooms are completely disgusting .
i hate shell , and especially danny 's .
got a standard car wash for $ _num_ and it was pretty subpar .
clearly once the sale is made the service is non existent .
i returned the fireplace and will purchase it somewhere else .
this sounded a bit fishy so i got a second opinion .
i will never go back to just brakes .
wow ... the customer service is horrible .
so nothing was resolved .
i would still never bring another car there again .
they are extremely unprofessional .
i 'm tired of going places and they pull this on us !
but just brakes was by far the worst !
that is not customer service .
i 've called corporate numerous times , no answer no response .
batteries are under the wheel well , yikes .
when i went back and asked for it , guess what i was told ?
i must have lost it because it was put on .
that had nothing to do with my battery cover .
never will i go back to a dishonest business again !
fool me once but never twice !
had a bad experience here .
_num_ minutes later he buzzed my hair and was done .
i expected more for a _num_ dollar haircut .
stupid bad .
horrible service .
bad haircut .
the haircut was crap and they do n't except cards .
i wish i could give it _num_ stars .
i will no longer spend my money at any of the circle k stores .
this is absolutely the worst circle k i 've ever been to .
terrible service !
their kitchen closes way too early !
everything inside is boring and dull !
the place needs major major surgery !
my guess is the business is probably out for sale .
this place sucks .
there no other way to say it .
dirty , smelly and dark .
yeah , doubt i 'll be back .
been there once before , but not my favorite .
normally this place is n't too bad for a hole-in-the-wall type place .
the server named rebecca is out of control and rude .
_num_ stars because their waitresses are rude !
be very weary of this place if you are not a local .
we have been twice for karaoke and both times left very disappointed .
avoid this company !
also , their website does not provide business hours ( pet peeve ) .
go somewhere else if you want office help that does n't give you attitude .
the driver was great , to bad he does n't answer the phone .
i used miracle grow , nothing ; organic tomato plant food , nothing .
sorry i wasted my money with this company .
i just called for a quote to clean windows and base boards .
i was very unimpressed with my visit .
i had to return to work was sick past the _num_ days .
no thanks !
stay away from this pharmacy .
no smile , and i could barely hear her speak .
bull .
worst pharmacy .
the pharmacy is a nightmare .
do they not get it that a lot of the people there are sick ?
cvs just lost another loyal customer .
horrible customer service .
i drive away and am having my prescription transferred to another pharmacy .
i do n't care if this is the closest pharmacy to my house .
the absolute worst pharmacy i 've ever dealt with .
they give exactly zero cares .
this is the worst pharmacy in the area !
i told them that this was impossible , as i have military coverage .
went back to cvs with my receipt for a refund .
they finally figure it out and i get my _num_ back .
this place has terrible customer service .
might want to think about the people you hire .
the pharmacy is _num_ hours and generally always busy .
the pharmacy at this location was by far the most disappointing .
my personal health concern is as small as the common cold .
i do n't expect perfection .
as in 20+ minutes to get whatever i order and the fries are unbearable .
i 've never noticed anything standing out good or bad .
and her attitude was not pleasant .
she took the order and as soon as she did walked away .
not very happy with it .
the chicken fries also seem to sit out before being ordered .
only stayed one lease period , could not afford the excessive ac charges .
not in my case .
i got the lettuce wraps , tiger shrimp , and chocolate souffle .
both of our appetizers were ok , nothing special .
what a complete disappointment !
the food was not good , and the price tag only made matters worse .
and being my first experience here , it was just terrible .
our entire party thought the food was mediocre and quite below par .
would this deter me from another visit to roy 's ?
apparently i am not getting this place .
the only thing appealing about dinner was the basil strawberry margarita .
maybe this is one of reasons why they have closed down the scottsdale location !
the restaurant is fancy , upscale , expensive , romantic , etc .
i was offered pasta & artichoke .
however , we went with friends last night and the food was terribly disappointing !
even the presentation was sloppy .
the cuts of fish were not uniform and thinner than we remember .
and from there it went downhill .
unfortunately , i know what a mai tai is supposed to taste like .
the salmon which we ordered medium rare was overcooked and not all that fresh .
the blackened ahi was cold in spots and warm in spots .
i 'm not sure exactly how they screwed it up .
over priced with horrible service .
she is rude , condescending , and lucky to have gotten a tip .
i found myself sadly disappointed with roy 's .
it truly had zero flavor .
i seriously consider that they may have forgotten an ingredient ?
i do n't consider myself a picky eater , and i love seafood .
the drinks were tasty but pricey which is expected for the setting .
for $ 30-40 per entree , you can do far better .
made zero effort to make it right .
times are getting better , much better .
i 've eaten all over the world , i 'm somewhat experienced .
it was just appalling .
totally screwed .
service was great but the food was terrible .
the only appetizer everyone raved about were the ribs but the rest were horrible .
we skipped desserts , no one wanted to try any .
not a good nor memorable experience at roy 's for us unfortunately .
one appetizer , one entree , no drinks and our bill was $ _num_ .
two ribs , pieces of chicken , shrimp , potstickers and sushi rolls .
overdone , dry .
food was okay , service was bizarre .
our server was completely disinterested .
appetizer never came and the waitress never mentioned it .
not going back .
unfortunately the food was not that great .
sat outside where it was a beautiful evening .
mahi was dry .
salmon not cooked thoroughly .
not even any rice or veggies .
this time nothing .
awful and wo n't be returning .
the pot stickers had been under the heat lamp way to long .
it was _num_ degrees on saturday !
i doubt we will be back .
really bland food , really overpriced .
no bread , edamame , i like it but others do n't .
$ _num_ for _num_ of us , and the wine was not that pricey .
so slow !
waited _num_ min between courses .
food was good , not the service i expect at its price point .
disappointing .
for the price point you 'd believe it would be fantastic .
not so much .
not , bad per se .
over priced , unprofessional , simply just not that good .
the service was way , way below par .
a few were very loud and instantly , roy 's became a pub .
roy 's invited this by setting up this seating area .
this is _num_ degrees different from how roy 's used to be .
sadly will think twice about returning .
from the hostesses to the waitress , everything was just wrong .
they need lots of training in customer service and guest satisfaction .
it is not !
shrimp was bland .
rice had not flavor and no spice .
very mediocre meal .
had an apple desert where they fire roasted the apple .
was nasty .
did n't eat it .
dinner for two was $ _num_ with one glass of wine .
you 'll save money and have a better meal .
butter fish was awful .
onion rings tasted like cardboard .
after two in half hours we got free dessert that was n't bad .
no complaints about the food except the house salad had a really sour taste .
they did n't offer to give us another salad .
this time was disappointing .
not worth $ _num_ for sure .
the caesars salad was wilted and somewhat brown .
the only reason for _num_ versus _num_ star was the souffl which was excellent .
would never recommend this restaurant as long as this is their general manager .
horrible experience for my employees and our customers .
they serve me sake wine glass !
everyone of these drinks were just terrible !
meal # _num_ was filet mignon with teppanyaki shrimp .
i asked for it to be cooked for a little longer and they obliged .
however , i now realized that the shrimp was missing .
this just was n't the kind of service we were expecting .
this really topped off a pretty disappointing experience .
but the service did n't compare to the food quality .
i was not impressed with the food here .
not so much anymore , and definitely not at this location .
with two glasses of wine the bill came to $ _num_ .
do n't waste your money on this overpriced restaurant .
it was not .
surprise , surprise - no call .
even my _num_ yr old hated it .
only went here because we were early for our movie that was next door .
folks , it 's empty when you walk in for a reason .
looks like a converted subway with an actual grill .
gyro meat should never be grilled on a grill , ever .
my wrap was sad .
this place is just not for me .
was also disappointed they did n't have ice tea made .
just not for me .
unfortunately , this last time we used this will be the last time .
i would not step foot in that store again .
when we got there there was absolutely no one in the grooming salon .
worst part ... .
i was too lazy to go anywhere else .
their quality is terrible .
called petco as i was trying to take my dog for grooming today .
she asked me for me to hold on ... then i hold .
i got transferred without notice ... then nicole answers the phone .
the first time , the groomer was found outside , smoking .
i drove across the street and went to petsmart instead .
very very disappointing .
too much .
also , the artichoke dip , sliders and tacos .
artichoke dip = large jar of mayo .
stay away from anything cooked , fried or with a sauce .
avoid anything cooked , fried or with a sauce .
did n't realize you could burn dried seaweed .
be careful not to sit next to the kitchen .
noisy !
raw sewage smell from the bathrooms .
maybe i just do n't get this place , i do n't know .
terrible service .
i do n't understand why people say this place is so good .
the artichoke was nasty , if this was n't frozen i would be shocked .
the pretzel sticks were dry and bland .
i did n't try it .
overall it was a lackluster and bland experience .
if i had the choice , i would not eat here again .
i 'm not sure , and neither does their 30+ page menu .
the bill arrived and to my surprise the chicken sandwich was still on there .
very large menu , but poor service .
we were just a party of _num_ and it was not a good visit .
others around us had similar problems .
i ca n't believe i waited so long to write about her .
elephant bar and grill is americanized version of asian food .
the food was okay , but the service is lacking .
sadly .
now that i am going to live here , no more .
pf chang 's has nothing to worry about .
very boring .
that said , the food here is not too bad .
for lunch , it 's a decently priced meal for a lot of grub .
very scary episode for me .
avoid this place at all costs .
secondly , their menu selection is pretty limited .
i also tried their pork banh mi sandwich .
this place does not do viet cuisine justice .
the pho was very sub par .
not a large portion at all for a $ _num_ price tag .
the shrimp and pork fried eggrolls for $ _num_ ?
horrible .
it 's like they do n't keep their veggies in a cooler .
i would not return here again .
ate here for lunch the other day , food was pretty meh .
really really bad .
* rice noodles in my chicken pho are gummy .
* bean sprouts are brown / old .
hard to believe a vietnamese place does not have fresh bean sprouts .
* chicken in pho is not fresh .
bad form .
this is an attempt at pho and vietnamese food .
not a fan of americanized pho .
what a huge disappointment .
first the guy gets the order wrong and is slow to correct the mistake .
the man behind the counter seemed mildly annoyed taking our order .
sick .
they could have cared less .
oh the rice was mushy .
it kind of grossed me out .
for that reason alone , i may not come back .
terrible service .
the rest just downhill from there .
the taste of the broth was mediocre , pretty bland .
the top was cover entirely with onions and green onions .
and the green onions were n't even chopped well .
the man in front seemed very bored of his job .
rip off .
for lunch i ordered the number # _num_ bun w/ beef .
literally was a few pieces of beef and the rest was all noodles .
i probably will be back to try their pho soup .
i ca n't believe this place has such high ratings !
i just left out of there disappointed !
it was sooo americanized , as i expected but hoped i was wrong .
the beef in the pho was tough .
the boba pearl was under cooked and hard .
not too bad but not what i expected .
next , i took a bite of my beef and it was ice cold .
i asked my wife how hers was and she said cold .
too bad , as that is the worst thing a restaurant can do .
went in tonight to try this place out .
so disappointing .
never going here for a pho fix again that 's for sure .
it came with wilted bean sprouts , no vegetables !
very disappointing .
skimpy on the noodles in the pho bowls .
spring rolls are pretty bad .
ok in a pinch but not a specific lunch destination .
probably wo n't come here again .
i looked around and quickly realized my mistake .
the looks that chef would get from the workers and customers would be epic !
i also am not really sure of the quality of their meats .
the service is not great either for what you pay .
sorry , _num_ star , not impressed .
sorry , i 'm a poker player .
i 'm pretty sick of harkins .
drove _num_ minutes to get to theater .
will not go to this theater again !
i forgot , they sometimes wash your car , sometimes they do n't .
ridiculous .
it was disgusting , nobody cared .
they did not do anything with it .
dealership should have stated that car had a major transmission issue .
not a fan of this dealership , have heard nothing but bad things .
it does not sound true .
this was the worst experience of my life in buying a car since _num_ .
i ca n't believe you have this kind of people running your business .
my problem is not solved and your dealership has closed the doors on me .
arrogant , unprofessional , disinterested sales people .
over _num_ hours later i finally got a call saying the car was ready .
useless , disinterested , internet sales people .
audi north scottsdale would not even get close to the price .
it does n't get any worse than this dealer or audi itself .
terrible experience .
i had a questionable experience with this dealership .
they said nothing needed to be done .
there was only one minor issue that did n't require any maintenance .
i called jason , my advisor at audi north and left a voice message .
i would n't even give this dealership one star .
when i asked what had been done , they only did the recall .
audi north scottsdale literally stole my car from me .
absolutely the worst service in the city .
the experience was lackluster and really uncomfortable at times .
it was the most bizarre retail experience i 've ever had .
either way i would strongly recommend avoiding this place , especially their service department .
very disappointed .
we left angry and disappointed with this dealer .
not one of the original issues !
do not go to this dealership !
i asked them if they were serious about selling it and walked out .
needless to say , my experience with chandler bmw was much better last year .
no other customers in the showroom !
got some salesperson , do n't remember his name .
why would they not know about the extended warranty ?
oh well - probably a sign not to buy a car here .
i think her behavior was unacceptable as i was not once rude to her .
marie or maria was extremely rude and unprofessional to me .
every time i 'm with her it 's so frustrating .
i would never come back .
an the associates are always very defensive and short when you inquire on pricing .
the lines here are also painful .
day _num_ of a _num_ day vacation one of the motors would not start .
so , now im left to taking them to court to sort this out .
i like everything mix together not just piled on top .
just wasted $ _num_ on a salad .
i threw away the salad after that .
will never return to this location unless they get rid of their careless employees .
the urgent care here is ridiculous !
_num_ hr wait then finally was taken back .
there is nothing immediate about this facility .
the ladies at the desk can not give any clue for a time wait .
nothing urgent about this place .
_num_ out of _num_ times my kids food is wrong .
i now avoid this location !
i hate two lane drive thru .
unfortunately i live in the area .
poor procedure inside .
each time no apologies and no offer to compensate even when i asked today .
go elsewhere like in n out across the street .
the worst service ever !
that is the worst bull i have ever heard .
i then used the restroom and there was no toilet paper .
needless to say , i walked out without ordering or using the restroom .
i am giving one star because there is no option for zero stars .
do not visit this location !
not really customer service oriented .
this place has terrible customer service .
but , why argue with me and have an attitude ?
after driving _num_ minutes home i discovered white rice .
they were already closed so i could n't call .
it 's not a big deal and i am a very reasonable customer .
i will not be returning .
i do n't really like rice and prefer lo mein noodles .
she quickly said .
no ... they ca n't do that .
ca n't do it .
hardly any veggies in their entrees .
they have driven me to cook my own chinese food .
food ... not impressed whatsoever .
no complaints here .
food is horrible now .
does n't feel fresh and soup had a smell .
the host and hostess behind the counter were totally confused about everything going on .
the only redeeming aspect was the food was pretty good .
first and last time i ordered to go they said _num_ min .
positively the worst chinese food i have ever purchased .
it just seems that they are using cheaper products but have still raised prices .
tonight , the atmosphere was flat .
i 'm sorry to say , it 's our last visit .
service is horrible .
hour and _num_ later not ready .
poor quality meats .
breading that is inedible and over cooked veggies that were limp and tasteless .
even the won tons were terrible .
his healthy choice white meat chicken was not done .
i never get sick !
his healthy choice white meat chicken was not done .
i never get sick !
i highly recommend not using this location .
their service and attitude is horrible .
it wo n't stay connected to my wifi .
if the reset even takes , which sometimes it does not .
i finally just walked out .
about _num_ weeks later i called to make an appointment on a saturday .
the receptionist is rude .
ok , can you get me in on sunday or another day ?
then she realized someone cancelled and was able to get me in .
i was very embarrassed .
these are probably the worst outlets i have ever been to .
no banana outlet ?
the polo outlet is probably the only reason to go .
this is a strange little complex of stores that calls itself an outlet mall .
crew , it seems a bit shabby and outdated .
considering how far it is ... save your gas and shop more locally .
so sad , maybe it used to be good ?
other than that im not very fond of the other stores .
they could definitly upgrade on alot of their stores to become alot better .
the experience they had was way less than pleasant .
we drove up here on a saturday and it should 've been packed .
that 's too bad .
i 'm spoiled by the outlet mall in vegas cuz this one sucks .
this outlet lacks good retail shops !
i gave one star because you ca n't pick lower than one star .
no apology or compassion ... he barely wanted to give me a refund .
they do n't care !
pizza was terrible and i was hungry .
most of the food at this food court was not good .
they do n't deserve your hard earned money .
no questions asked , do not pass go , do not collect $ _num_ .
she knew beyond question that she was far better than me .
you guys do n't deserve to have my business .
well , it was even worse than the first time !
i guess that explains part of the reason why it tastes so bad !
even the ones that are meant to go in the microwave are questionable .
pizza might be good if it was hot .
something is very wrong with the management of this store .
unbelievable .
it makes me cry every time i walk in and out of this store .
no one seems trained at all .
secondly , the prices on most of the things are very over over-priced .
also , the miniature dog bed prices are out of this world .
i am overall just disappointed with the overall experience of this trashy supermarket .
poor customer service .
only two check outs open on sundays ; with long lines in each .
no one really seems to care or take pride in the store or job .
i ca n't count how many times i 've been charged wrong .
we 've been good customers and tipped at least $ _num_ per delivery .
way to reward loyal customers domino 's .
put in an online order for a couple pizzas and cheesy bread .
this is by far the worst mcdonald 's i have ever been to .
every single time i go they mess my order up .
really , avoid this one like the plague !
still wo n't try the food again .
disgusting !
the food is not very good .
the anthem mcdonald 's is a joke .
it 's not a difficult job .
but not this one .
slow , i jean really slow without a good process .
sad as it 's the only one close .
i wo n't be back .
i love mcdonald 's but the service here was awful .
and the wait was beyond ridiculous .
it 's too bad because i really , really wanted to like them .
i would be very careful before i used this agent for insurance .
he does not have ethical business practices .
yikes , this food was terrible .
super greasy , tasteless pizza .
tables greasy ; napkin holder was coated w food and grease .
for $ _num_ , i think one would expect a really good pizza .
wrong .
not even domino 's .
i wish i could give zero stars .
it was tasteless and soggy .
not to mention it was extremely expensive .
totally disappointed .
had a random bad smell in restaurant too .
this is not it !
the owner does not seem to like his job .
i do n't even know how they can call this pizza !
we have ordered pizza from this location on several occasions .
out of _num_ people in our household , _num_ people ate the pizza .
the _num_ person was a _num_ year old that only ate breadsticks .
refused to give me any information or help what so ever .
i will probably not eat here again and stick with delivery .
the pizza took forever and was undercooked , no crunch to it .
i was pretty bummed about the whole experience , what a waste of calories .
so she then said they would call me back !
no call ... .
was i disappointed .
i 've had bad pizza before but this was bad .
tough , over cooked , half cold .
the breadsticks were boring and dull .
i remember pizza hut used to be the place to get the best pizza .
do n't waste your time ordering here .
sure would be nice to get my $ _num_ back .
_num_ stars for the drive through .
i would not be giving any stars if not for the coffee being decent .
that said , the service ( drive through ) is terrible .
last time i come to this location ever !
absolutely horrible customer service .
he told us no and to go to pizza hut _num_ restaurants down .
i was appalled by his actions and lack of service .
this is the worst starbucks i 've ever been to .
there is zero customer service skills here and the drinks are made horribly .
i just do n't understand how they can be so slow !
bad attitude and no personality .
if you 're in a hurry do n't go to this starbucks .
it 's slow , always , no matter how many cars .
so slow it 's hard to believe these guys are still even in business .
maybe someone can open a dutch bros in anthem .
it took _num_ minutes to get my drink .
this is the consistently slowest starbucks i 've ever been to .
messed with the wrong starbucks drinker though for two reasons .
also , i spend about _num_ $ a month on starbucks me alone .
not going back .
the service here is absolutely horrible .
just horrible !
the drive-thru baristas come across as rude and not very customer friendly .
they are so slow .
no urgency .
not what i 've seen in other starbucks .
the drink was n't called when it back to the bar .
no wonder they closed once already !
bad customer service rude and nasty .
home depot has much better pricing and better customer service .
low quality and not very authentic .
sorry ... did n't care for it at all .
this place is disgusting !
manager did n't care at all .
_num_ % of the time they mess up your order .
out of the entire store there is only one friendly guy up front .
worst customer service ever .
the staff is so rude .
but this experience was so thoroughly terrible i 'm making an exception .
ok , so we tried calling our order in .
does he never look left when he answers the phone ?
horrible food .
i do n't understand how this place stays in business !
disgusting .
companion ordered a burger and it was overcooked and lukewarm at best .
the service , however , was horrible .
it also took a long time to order another beer and our check .
an adequate sports bar if you need one .
food is typical frozen & nothing special .
not good .
service sucked and food was mediocre at best .
first , and last visit unfortunately .
i ordered fish tacos , which maybe that was my first mistake .
i 've never written a food review but people should be warned .
first , it was dirty and dingy inside .
i felt dirty just sitting down .
i wish the waitress would have noticed and asked , but oh well .
none of the good servers that use to be there are there any longer .
i wish i could rate no stars .
i came here with _num_ adults and _num_ kids ( all under _num_ ) .
big mistake .
no just more styrofoam .
left money on the table after finishing my beer and left .
on the positive , restaurant seems cleaner .
beyond that , restaurant remains subpar .
food seems to be re heated highly processed ... not fresh .
my order upfront was wrong on three separate occasions .
i wo n't be frequenting this place in the future .
unfortunate , because i was excited for the change .
i was disappointed .
hamburger and fries were cold .
service was not any different than before which was average .
i had hopes it would have improved but no .
typical prepared , previously frozen bar food .
there 's absolutely nothing about this place that 's even close to above average .
keep up the mediocre work guys .
mediocre food .
mediocre service .
mediocre decor and atmosphere .
this place is still terrible with new ownership .
terrible snob attitudes !
not worth it to me to give a 3rd change .
service was a joke , restaurant was dirty and the food !
there were only three other tables sat when we went in mind you .
our waitress was not very attentive and was more interested in watching tv .
my wife ordered the bbq bacon burger and the bread was soggy .
not impressed .
zero stars .
he ordered multiple x rays of my _num_ month old son .
just a way to get more money !
because of location , i chose a pediatrician closer to my home in peoria .
worst haircut i 've ever had !
what a waste of $ _num_ .
awful cut and awful experience .
and it was sub par at best .
meh x _num_ .
outdated building .
sub-par produce .
frequented by creepy `` hills have eyes '' people at all times .
like , literally .
uh , ok.
`` no problem , '' they say .
just do n't bother with this place .
why say the eggs are $ _num_ and then charge your customer $ _num_ ?
our of stock meds , late fills and incompetent new employees .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
stupid expensive !
the gas is stupid expensive .
the staff is hit and miss .
some are okay , some are downright apathetic .
unfortunately i echo most of the reviews here .
rude cashier , i believe her name was erin ( short blond hair ) .
but , instead , they screw the neighbors day in and day out .
i go out of my way to avoid buying gas here .
too bad .
not when i 'm the only customer in the store though .
if you have options do n't stop here after 11pm .
bathrooms constantly covered with crap ... literally .
if you want to lose a pet , this is the place to call .
not the best location .
no sign or anything explaining that .
decor had n't been updated since _num_ .
the other waitress could have covered up some .
looked like she was going to a club .
restaurant full of smoke when we walked in .
lots of mushrooms but not much meatball .
almost to the point of being too much .
it was cheap but probably wo n't go back .
come on , do n't ruin my favorite pizza place .
i would never go back to this place again .
the older woman who works behind the counter is beyond rude !
she hung up on me while trying to place my order .
this is clearly not a business that cares about their customers .
they definitely lost my business and i recommend avoiding at all costs !
checked out this place from the groupon last night .
friday night at _num_ most tables were full one server .
i didnt want to complain i was tired of this place .
that should not happen with white pizza .
until then , avoid .
it was soo greasy and a bit salty .
the crust was chewy , not in a good way .
the sauce was n't really all that great either .
service was not very friendly .
place looks like it needs some tlc .
gosh , i ca n't think of anything nice to say .
the pizza was thin , cheesy , and greasy .
the sausage roll came out _num_ minutes before my pizza did .
it was doughy and not very flavorful .
if you decide to try this place stick to pizza with marinara sauce .
the white pizza was bland and also not very flavorful .
if you decide to try this place stick to pizza with marinara sauce .
and their wings are horrible .
possibly the worst wings i 've ever had .
it 's not me , it 's you .
time for us to see other people , i guess .
after we sat another _num_ minutes we left .
they certainly have no clue how to time other food with pizza .
the service : if the pizza was bad nobody would ever return .
he did agree to take $ _num_ off our total bill .
but on this night , it was just `` ok '' , nothing special .
much less sauce and cheese on the pie .
wo n't be going back unfortunately .
_num_ .
_num_ .
if a pizza is black on the bottom it should not be served .
all in all , it was n't a great meal .
i remember it being much better a long , long time ago .
unfortunately i ordered pasta .
my husband got pizza , and i tried a bite .
customer service was meh .
it made for a really awkward dinner .
i probably wo n't be back though .
if i 'm going out for pizza , i go to venezia 's pizzeria .
we had a disgusting chicken parmigiana hero .
the next visit we decided to stick to the plain cheese pizza .
it is awful !
we did n't even finish our slices .
the tasteless garlic knots were brought out still frozen in the middle .
so terrible .
the pizza was garbage .
two tables sitting at 6:30 and a _num_ minute wait for the pizza .
well , it looks like i am back to square one .
i purchased a groupon for this place and finally got around to using it .
no big deal ... .
it just meant we had plenty of time to second guess our ordering decisions .
the waitress brought the bill & i gave here my groupon .
a $ _num_ dollar groupon discount turned into a $ _num_ discount .
do n't put it out there if you have no honor .
good was not bad i 've had better but it 's not disgusting .
when i went to pay with my groupon they would n't accept it .
very rude and almost seemed as if he did n't speak english .
the place was dead on a friday .
_num_ tables being used .
this is the second time we have had such terrible service from this place .
we should still get our dumb $ _num_ off .
but no .
so , i will not be going back.
this time was n't so good .
tasted horrible .
very disappointed that the original owners are n't there anymore .
i would n't recommend a sicilian pie , they have no clue .
the chicken parm hero is soggy .
_num_ years .
it 's inexcusable for a restaurant to serve what i was served this evening .
i have been here two times and that 's gon na be it .
did i mention the sandwich was completely overpriced as well ?
this is sad excuse for a restaurant .
clean your crap and listen to people when they order food .
the food was okay but customer service could be more respectful !
she said they would honor the groupon .
go to pick everything up , and no chicken wings or garlic knots .
to which he looked at me like i were stupid .
lousy service with incompetent employees .
i ca n't speak to the dine-in experience since we took it home .
but there was definitely no confusion on what style pizza to expect .
the pizza on the other hand was a bit disappointing .
cheese did n't really have much flavor and the dough was n't very memorable .
very heavy on the cheese and very little sauce .
this was the most horrible food i have ever had .
now it had really hit the level of terrible dining .
no the thanks they can keep their low quality high priced food .
the salon is n't very pretty , but that does n't really matter .
my friend 's mani and pedi was not as good as mine .
it is not even worth the _num_ $ s because it wo n't last .
i will not be going back here .
totally unacceptable !
they tried to up sell me on everything ... not happy .
horrible !
they could not even accommodate me within a reasonable time frame .
they quoted me _num_ minutes to wait and then they would service me .
needless to say we wo n't be returning .
worst service i 've ever had .
highly unprofessional , he did n't even address my presence or greet me .
worst customer service i have ever experienced , extremely rude and unprofessional staff .
he had already learned everything and needed to be more challenged .
dirty , over crowded and not qualified apparently to even watch children !
and , they charge for rice .
is it possible to have two horrible experiences in one weekend ?
i 'd been here before and my experience was n't bad .
this time around though , i felt like i wanted to kill myself .
we walked in , it was busy .
all the food looked fucking miserable .
_num_ minutes later , we get _num_ menus .
we ordered our food , and it was fucking useless .
what the shit is wrong here ?
on this hot spring day , we never got refills on our waters .
bottom line ... .
)
do not ever tell a customer he is a liar .
tonight makes me want to change my mind .
i walked in and then straight back out .
i love native new yorker , but this location has been consistently awful .
this location is trash central .
terribly .
an absolute embarrassment to the company .
if you like wings , go to another store and get the good ones .
this one does not .
but wow the service here is terrible .
this is the very worst native i have been to .
i have no idea why i go back .
horrible service .
service downhill , food is eh , we 're done going here .
all around a pretty horrible experience .
would n't recommend visiting here unless you want terrible service and terrible food .
big thumbs down to this place .
they only had one waitress running the entire floor .
service and food was very slow and when the order came it was wrong .
there was barely any sauce on the strippers .
i 'm really unimpressed .
it still does n't feel right .
after this meal , i doubt i 'll ever go back .
manager was n't much help , offer a free beer or dessert will ya ?
not a good way to get your guests back !
he was awesome and trained the other servers .
the new space is cold and awkward ... we 've switched to takeout .
they 're clearly struggling to find their way .
too many other choices out there .
not sure we 'll be back anytime soon .
sad that this family tradition has faded away .
this place has the worst wings .
the prices went up over _num_ bucks for a dozen wings .
plus the wings are horrible , as if they get them from kfc .
i wish they would go back and purchase quality wings .
horrible experience tonight !
according to our server , this happens every monday .
the kitchen just seems to fall apart she says .
this place is poorly managed !
went in to grab some lunch after my haircut .
i stood there over _num_ minutes waiting to be seated .
no one came over or said anything to me .
terrible service .
have n't been to native in awhile and decided to try them out again .
the wings were good but too much sauce in my opinion .
this is probably the worst food and service was horrible .
the drinks were watered down .
the server was horrible .
he was very annoyed to be there waiting on us .
do n't ever go there it 's horrible .
the dumb girl who answered the phone says `` no .
& then hung up on me .
why the hell did you answer the phone you idiot ?
it 's certainly not because of the staff .
rude .
absolutely hated the two years i went to school there .
one of the most disorganized establishments i 've ever had to deal with .
horrible college !
not just once , but several times .
this is crap .
seriously so annoyed .
i am extremely disappointed , and do not recommend this school .
they deserve 4/5 or 5/5 stars .
financial aid makes me want to gives this place a _num_ .
i also paid _num_ for the book and was not refunded a penny .
i also emailed the dean and was told that there decision is final .
there are better prices at almost any other smoke shop in the area .
wow the customer service is super lacking over here .
i walked in and asked for a quote on the rates .
you look around and there are no prices anywhere at all .
then gave me a quote of _num_ a month for a one bedroom .
i paid for _num_ week and checked out _num_ days early .
the remote they gave me came with no batteries .
the previous tenant was getting calls all hours of the night , every night .
the guy above me sounded like he was moving furniture until _num_ am .
lousy , dirty , filthy , b e d bugs !
he threw us out because he was caught with a bed bug problem .
_num_ bed bug can have _num_ 's of babies .
rude , unhealthy place to stay .
you are lousy .
charge quite a big for rooms and the rooms are run down and smell .
charge quite a big for rooms and the rooms are run down and smell .
big disappointment .
there was nothing for vegetarians .
the food was mediocre at best .
no good .
the ambience was better than most .
this is one of the worst service i ever had .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i know economy is bad , but the place is way too hot .
_num_ .
took forever to get my bill .
_num_ .
there 's no sign about paying extra if under $ _num_ .
weak sauce ... literally .
i ordered the pho veggies and was sadly disappointed .
the food is not good as i expected .
the original owner and his wife are no longer working or cooking there .
the food is not quite as good as before .
the pho soup was too peppery , which is very unusual .
spring rolls - basic - ca n't go wrong ?
ick .
but there really is an herb called fish mint .
apparently they do n't serve it with pho .
when she walked in , the waiting room was full of people .
she was told they did not want patients that would walk out on appointments .
not good for someone who is supposed to be helping patients .
they do not provide any kind of email reminder service , even upon request .
admittedly , i was not uber friendly either .
it clearly was not an appointment .
he was really just shooting the shit .
there was no apology for the wait time .
no real explanation .
there is no excuse for that .
none of them mentioned anything to the receptionist about being early .
very rude office staff what there is of it .
do n't go see this doctor .
seriously , find somebody else .
the reviews on this page are _num_ % accurate .
do not use these people to finance your vehicle .
i 'm pissed .
as others have said , stay far away from this place .
i agree stay far far away .
i had poor credit _num_ and needed to start over .
i was n't that impressed .
having been here before , i knew what to expect .
the only thing decent here is the prices .
the place feels run down , and really needs a serious overhaul .
what a big fat fail this place is .
unfortunately , i filled four washers and then realized that they did n't work .
two of the four dryers nearly dried my clothes in one cycle .
there was no heat in either one .
i 've been to this place twice and would never come back .
i would n't recommend this place to my worst enemy ... ... .
old broken soda machines & broken glass & empty vending machine .
machine # _num_ hot water does n't work !
this place is the absolute worst .
this place totally sucks im going somewhere else .
not user friendly and kind of a scam .
the service here , in the afternoons no less , is consistently slow .
how can you mess up a franchise ?
tater tots are n't too horrid either .
orders are consistently wrong , the wait times , all of it .
past _num_ years have been back , maybe once a month .
they were n't even made correctly so i left mine on the table .
wish i would have just got my money back .
the service here is always super slow .
not worth my time to deal with them to get the money back .
horrible customer service .
i ordered the brownie bliss milkshake literally not one piece of brownie .
there is sheer disappointment written on my face .
been sitting in the drive thru for _num_ minutes and not moved .
this is insane .
does n't stop us from getting our midnight shakes though !
i live close by .
!
wasted so much time and money at this location ... .
so we asked them to remake it .
just ridiculous !
bad business and bad services .
i hope they shut this place down !
teriyaki chicken was nothing special .
curry chicken just was n't good .
almost too big really .
maybe it was an off day , but i just was n't really impressed .
wo n't be coming back here again .
my chicken was so plain .
it was just teriyaki chicken .
hard to mess up .
just dont go for the food .
ordered the chicken bowl and the chicken was extremely dry .
same as any fast food chinese place .
would not recommend ever !
surely not i .
all in all , the nurses that i had were all rude and annoying .
then the nightmare was to start .
terrible er .
maybe the staff in other areas is decent but the er is just awful .
oh , and they do everything they can to avoid running tests .
hello , allergy !
i 've having terrible chest pains and trouble breathing .
they gave me a mask and told me to have a seat .
_num_ instead of _num_ .
this was for a second bill for the actual physician .
i should have just popped it back in myself instead of going to banner !
worst experience i could of imagined ... .
the lady was so rude and refused to let me speak to someone else .
worst hospital experience ever .
without giving into any medical details - the staff is rude and uninterested .
worst hospital ever !
if you love your family ... do n't take them here .
my husband died here when he should not have died at all !
horrible experience in _num_ .
none of the nurses could draw blood on my baby .
i wish i could remember his name .
i do n't even know where to start !
we were there for _num_ days and every day was worse then the last .
worst experience of my life here !
very disappointing experience .
bottom line : i would n't return to this location !
this place has me fucking furious .
she never came out to the waiting room .
no fucking reason to do what that nurse did .
i had an allergic reaction and could barely breathe or walk .
it was just really scary to go that long in a hospital without help .
my doctor and nurse made me feel like i was wasting their time .
ridiculously soft and uncomfortable toilet seat is falling off .
this is a hospital .
they just made a quick buck off united healthcare .
do n't go to this hospital unless you have a minor problem .
they gave me a better stomach medication than i already have .
sometimes things just never get done .
_num_ strikes and you 're out banner desert !
they do n't care are rude and do n't do anything for anybody .
check in was smooth and professional but the er nurse was less than professional .
she was very rude and quick to the point .
but that was n't the real issue with our visit .
this is the last thing anyone would expect form a medical professional .
they do n't care .
absolutely horrible service treatment !
so i refused the x-ray .
do n't you want your script !
rude .
rude .
rude .
no biggie .
i pointed out that she stopped me as i was walking out the door .
horrible hospital !
he would get better care at home !
the whole banner system is horrible !
they wait till you are dying to do something about your health problems .
when he arrived at banner desert he was treated as though he was trash .
hi kristen - i would like to help .
i 'm sorry if our responses seem generic or canned at times .
that was the purpose of the wheel chair .
th place sucks .
warning stay away .
this place sucks .
by then there were _num_ people in front of me .
so that made me wait even longer .
they literally did n't do anything .
just asked me what my pain was from 1-10 .
gave me some prescription for meds and away i went .
what a waste of time .
everyone in the waiting room was freaking out .
this is ridiculous .
i seriously hate this hospital .
they suck and they do n't even care about you .
i have not even set foot in the store and i never will .
then i realized i 'd forgotten if she said 1:30 or 11:30 .
i rescheduled for 1:30 on a saturday .
the bride and i were kind of put off .
then we emailed them , hoping to get someone who was n't the receptionist .
not even an apology or a manager stepping in .
i 'm getting married this october .
i drove from peoria to mesa to find my dress here .
a huge waste of my drive .
not worth the drive at all for those kinds of dresses .
horrible .
both left very unhappy with experience .
bad idea !
she is a size _num_ .
she found _num_ she liked , but it was too big .
it was a good _num_ inches too big !
if the dress is not perfect , do n't buy here !
fail !
fail !
fail !
you ca n't reach a person on the phone .
the staff said that there was not an appointment available for _num_ months .
she was absolutely horrible .
i had a horrible experience with this office .
terrible .
the concept of time means nothing to this group .
how about you stop booking folks in the p.m. instead ?
poor service culture here .
dash off to another firm .
they just want to see numbers not a quality visit .
first visit here , will not go back .
finally , i was seen by an assistant , instead of doctor .
she was so rushed in my session it was over before it began .
this dermatologist is the worst i have ever been too .
what an impersonal treatment !
the providers are fine , the staff is horrible .
simply they do not care .
stupid me , i should have moved years ago .
this is by far the worst mexican food i have ever had .
the bacon in my burrito was raw for starters .
there carne asada with more like dog food .
granted , i have been to no whataburger !
and both visits were terrible , in every way .
everyone has bad days .
it sounded good , i like lemon stuff , why not ?
as i part with my money , the window begins to close .
i wait , and i wait , and i wait some more .
oh , and of course the meal was absolutely terrible .
old , cold and full of mold .
ok , ok i thought to myself .
just kidding , out again .
nope , as long as last time .
and the food was even worse .
... continues to be the slowest drive through in maricopa county .
is there anyone in whataburger management that can get this restaurant back to speed ?
_num_ minutes to take the order of the two cars in front of me .
... asked to wait before taking my order .
_num_ minutes to deliver orders to the _num_ cars in front of me .
_num_ minutes wait to receive my order .
total _num_ minutes for `` fast '' food drive through .
i might as well go to a sit down restaurant .
also no coffee at _num_ am !
terrible customer service at this location .
will never return to this whataburger .
for the money , it does n't get much better .
the total cost was going to exceed $ _num_ !
this place lacks even mediocre customer service .
the service was terrible , not much of a food selection .
our waitress was the worst .
food was weak .
totally not worth the _num_ bones per person for buffet .
none were good .
my wife pointed out a dead cockroach as we were about to leave .
do not eat here .
i want my _num_ dollars , and _num_ hours back .
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
rude rude rude .
Negative
i give them a negative star & we will never go there again .
terrible experience !
thanks for the horrible experience , we 'll never be back .
please do n't waste your money here !
do n't waste your time or money .
the range hitting area was bare dirt .
that took _num_ plus hours to play nine holes !
as we were coming back , we saw groups playing hole _num_ .
absolutely and incredibly absurd !
avoid this course like the plague !
staff were mediocre at best .
the fairways were ok , same with the bunkers .
fairly slow but they did roll true .
if you like a challenging course , this is not it .
_num_ hour wait for a physical .
they only had _num_ doctor working .
worst medical experience i 've ever received .
unless you are physically bleeding , go to a hospital or a real doctor .
i went to this place with my husband and my _num_ yr old son .
once we sat down to eat .
i was soooo disgusted after this , i could n't eat my meal .
never again will i ever go back to this place .
this place was god awful .
my best advice , just do n't go here .
a little sketchy .
you drop off your clothes .
i would n't even iron them let alone wash them .
they are ruined .
once you leave you 're stuck .
i 've already paid and as usual have no receipt .
my `` beef '' is the food .
it 's like printing money .
bad choice on my part ?
or , it might just not be to my palette .
also there were hairs in the sandwiches from the guy who made them .
not pleasant .
i normally tip , but not this time .
never going back !
i 'm terribly disappointed after spending a long time starving for my food .
not much else .
extremely upsetting since cheba hut will now never have my business again .
they then informed me that they had n't even started making my order yet !
i was appalled as was the employee standing next to him .
been coming here for _num_ years , consistently .
never once had any sort of issues with employees being rude , until today .
sorry cheba hut , you wo n't be getting my cash anymore .
eh it 's nothing special .
but every time i ever get food from here there 's an issue .
do not use this facility .
the staff is rude and very busy chatting with each other .
made an appointment for _num_ am .
did not see a doctor for over _num_ hours .
waiting room is dirty and has no magazines or toys for kids .
not the way to do business .
my appointment was booked and all set .
my biggest issue is the rude short notice and no choice on my part .
i tried to reach customer service and was given a number .
she then gave me a number and told me to ask for steven .
tell me would you like to be called at the last minute .
_num_ stars for roasted meats .
obviously whoever could read it would know what it 's supposed to be like .
this used to be our go-to chinese restaurant in the east valley !
hello , we 're trying to send you a message idiot .
well what can i say about best hong kong ?
there service is probably deserves a _num_ % , it 's that bad .
do n't go here if you can help it .
the service is terrible .
only thing i like is their barbecue items .
this is by far the worst place i have ever been .
we ordered peking pork chops and it tasted like orange chicken , try figure .
me and my wife had a headache as well .
it was incredible how terrible the bowl was .
there was no rice taste whatsoever .
made me wait _num_ minutes for some pan fried noodles and fried rice .
if i could rate this place _num_ stars i would .
as terrible as the service was the food was one hundred times worse .
my girlfriend and i tried this place out for the first time .
i then felt bad and filled in a _num_ % tip .
the food was slightly warm and got cold the minute i started eating .
not eating in again , i 'll take my duck to go .
service is sooo bad !
do n't want to go there any more .
a server there said she does n't welcome asu 's students .
also , she seems like impatient when we order .
roasted duck is mediocre .
the duck skin is not very crisp , but the seasoning is fine .
this was the worst chinese food i 've ever had .
i ordered cashew chicken lunch special .
the only thing i touched was the crab puff .
terrible service .
this has happened consistently that i no longer trust eating the roast duck here .
massive disappointment .
apps were greasy and bland .
the texture of the meat was weird and the sauce had literally no flavor .
but one of the servers shout at us and asks to leave .
good for cantonese style bbq with whole ducks hanging and bbq pork on display .
Neutral
if i could i would give it negative stars .
we told him that one of the cabinets ( sink ) had water damage .
they said no problem bring them by .
very very disappointed with my whole experience with them .
would rather take all my stuff to the dump than back there .
it looked old and ... not renovated !
the fried chicken on the side was unexpectedly the only thing i found ok .
i went back _num_ months ago and was not happy .
big mistake .
no meat or vegetables at all .
just ramen and a lump of curry paste .
there was no greeting , no smile and no attempt to communicate .
my wife 's awful ramen came out a good _num_ minutes before my katsu .
just really surly , unfriendly service .
i 'd rather eat anything than this crap .
avoid this place .
needless to say it tasted horrible .
every ingredient in the bowl was old and of low quality including the ramen .
but everything just seems off .
usually wrong ingredients in items ... or the food just tasting off .
looked like just my kind of place .
i would not order sushi here .
the salmon was very not fresh .
the tuna was not fresh .
even the cucumber sushi was not great as it was mushy .
which is why this review is not a _num_ star .
never asked how the food was , never refilled our drinks .
i 'm not even sure we were charged the write price .
there was nobody at this place .
paid $ _num_ for an awful california roll and some edamame .
i ate one piece and could n't bring myself to eat another .
good thing i ordered edamame otherwise it would 've been a complete waste .
the food was alright , but the service was abysmal .
we live only _num_ mile away and love authentic japanese food .
what a disappointment !
the owner is n't as nice as other reviewers said .
overall , the food was better than i expected for a place in phoenix .
we waited _num_ minutes for someone to acknowledge us and take our order .
another _num_ minutes for the food .
the tofu came without rice , which took another _num_ minutes .
even when they make eye contact , they ignore you .
there were no apologies from the waiters for the wait .
they did not even smile .
the very worst part of the meal was paying .
i wish we could have given him all the tip .
menu not big enough for me .
yes .
overall , the food was mediocre .
the food prices are too high for the quality offered .
our service was terrible .
the servers would not look in our direction for _num_ minutes at a time .
it is not easy to get the waitress 's attention .
took _num_ minutes to get a menu .
another _num_ to get our drinks .
they give complimentary salad which includes iceberg lettuce ... and teriyaki sauce .
no thanks .
bulgogi : really was n't good at all .
it should be thin , and tender , and flavorful .
apparently that means zero spicy or just adding _num_ jalapeno slices into the soup .
they also brought the dishes out at different times which is bad form .
what the hell are those shrimp , and why are they on my table ?
it blows this place away on all levels .
really is n't a whole lot of good to say about this place .
been here multiple times ... busy or not busy , service is always slow .
tables are available but no one seems to want to clean them .
rude .
probably the last time i 'm coming here .
i 'm asian , so that make me a automatic expert on korean food .
the interior of this restaurant needs a renovation badly .
not worth eating out .
the `` kimchi pancake '' was tasty , but my bibimbap was quite bland .
overall , i was content with the experience , but certainly was n't impressed .
in reality , it took another hour and ten minutes to get our food .
i never stiff wait staff , having worked in food service myself .
however , they added a mandatory _num_ % gratuity to our bill .
but at that point , we were just ready to get out of there .
i mean , really ?
the lady told her they have no more potato .
but they are constantly busy , bringing out food to other tables .
but every cart is full of those side dish and the potatoes were there .
so why did they tell us there is no more potato ?
pissed me off .
just a bad day today .
too slow .
so bad .
the chicken grill is bad choice for us as well .
i taste nothing but salty overly done chicken meat .
first , i would like to say that the staff and waiters were nice .
was n't proud of that at all .
the place was decent , nothing fancy and nothing too dirty .
so overall my experience was a _num_ and a half of _num_ .
so here 's is why i gave the place a one star ... .
then , they changed owner and food quality is not as good anymore .
omg , it was the worst dinning experience we had for a long time .
first , bad service ; you seat yourself and wait .
the two waitresses were running like crazy .
the seafood pancake had only a couple of tiny shrimps in it .
that was a big surprise and a big disappointment also .
for the same price , you can get way better food and service elsewhere .
no booths , uncomfortable tables and chairs .
well , chinese take-out is at least cheap .
very bad service .
: ( went out , and went back to throw up .
: ( i truly felt like i was going to die .
rushed me to hospital .
i could n't talk , walk , or function .
absolute worst feeling in the world .
my feeling is that soup was bad .
i 'm going to talk to the manager , i want a full refund .
update : sean the owner helped to get me a full refund .
he also gave me a gift card for future use .
plus the food has always been a hit or miss .
the only constant thing i have enjoyed is the kimchi pancakes .
$ _num_ spicy octopus was like chewy rubber and totally inedible .
there are better korean restaurants around .
looking back directly at three other servers as they just stand around talking .
ca n't be all random .
even main dish is lacking ingredients and no taste .
service is so bad .
crazy place never ever had before .
sever is stupid , only one sever .
also food is tasting so bad .
wo n't come here again .
the kalbi was cooked to a good texture , but it sadly lacked flavour .
it tasted like pure spiciness , rather than having other tastes .
once again , this dish lacked flavour also .
the least worst dish , in my opinion , was the soon tofu .
i did n't want to base my review off one experience .
i know , weird .
$ _num_ for spicy pork ?
both of our dishes tasted less appetizing than usual .
it was nowhere near $ _num_ of tasty .
service is where i lost it .
water refills _num_ minutes plus .
rude !
disappointed because i really likes going there !
do not call cactus garage doors to fix your garage door !
if i could give them no stars , i would .
two weeks later , no phone call , so i called them .
worst experience ever !
they 've been here _num_ times and it is not fixed .
he lacked in social skills as well .
the female who answers the phone for cactus garage doors was just as unprofessional .
unfortunately our home warranty company chose these folks to do the job .
maybe they 'll ( home warranty co. ) come to their senses !
absolutely crap .
instead i look at my security gate to see a card sitting there .
cactus garage door was very unprofessional when it came to fixing my garage .
i would never recommend them to fix anyone 's garage .
in my case they never showed .
do not use this company .
very rude and did not do what they said they would .
poor customer service !
the tech came back out stating he screwed up .
the ones i used to go to in louisiana were good .
they had etouffee and mardi gras cheesecake that were great .
this one is awful .
the chicken was old and not fresh .
there were bugs crawling everywhere made us loose out appetite .
my friend and i had a craving for fried chicken on a saturday night .
like previous reviews stated the restaurant is very messy .
there was not a clean table in the restaurant .
i ate my chicken , even though i ordered spicy they gave me mild .
the chicken was decent but i felt dirty after sitting there for _num_ minutes .
restaurant could use a deep cleaning as its quite aged .
but i wo n't go inside due to the poor cleanliness and bugs .
but tonight was terrible .
then a lady came onto the speaker and was so rude .
i will not be returning to this location .
usually find myself trying to get in and out rather quickly .
you might even be asked for money in the parking lot .
service is basically poor and trying to communicate is difficult and a bit tricky .
normally have to repeat myself a few times to get the order correct .
ca n't resist getting several jalapenos to give the meal some additional kick .
tried the catfish on my last visit and was surprised how small it looked .
horrible service .
if i could give them zero stars , i would .
completely screwed up my order giving me regular chicken instead of chicken tenders .
do n't ever walk our of here without checking your order .
tried for an hour to call the store and no one would answer .
wrote a complaint on their corporate website and got no response .
service here is horrible .
_num_ hrs to go and no spicy breast !
he was just as amazed as i was a few minutes earlier .
shit was so bad i was afraid to feed it to my dog .
poor quality and awful management .
ordered _num_ piece and manager chicken and gave me _num_ breast .
horrible service , waited for _num_ minutes just for the fries .
this location is terrible .
if i could rate _num_ stars , i would .
the manager who took our order did n't even work at an acceptable pace .
i would n't recommend this location to anyone .
to add , once home , our order was incorrect .
with that said , this is the absolute worst location i 've ever seen .
i went there today to get a simple _num_ piece mild dinner .
one lady asked for the manager 's name and was totally ignored .
at this point myself , and a few other people got refunds and left .
they 've had long wait times for years and had recently been improving .
my problem is the employees .
the place is always dirty and the workers seem to hate being there .
now ca n't even get money back .
never ever again ... and to top it no one else was there .
picked up _num_ strips and _num_ fish strips and fries .
the fries were almost cold and not very tasty .
i think i 've ate there twice today my first and my last .
i ca n't express how disappointed i am with this business .
this customer experienced turned out to be a confused mess !
i was not happy .
i guess it just was n't my day or something .
i was incredibly disappointed .
after a long summer in flip flops i really needed this service done .
i do n't pay for a pedicure just i get nail polish put on .
not a good nail salon .
there is n't a cash register .
it 's just loose money .
the tools they use for pedicure is a bit odd .
magazine papers below your feet if you 're getting a special pedicure .
if you do n't get him , do n't expect anything special .
last weekend i had my bridal shower and got my mani done here .
she flat out told me no , that silver is better .
i said i would like pink instead , and she still said no .
as the paying customer , i should have the right to choose my colors .
i am angry and will not return to this place .
not impressed .
unfortunately service at this location is pretty pathetic .
the meat chunks were tough and not fit to eat .
the rice and beans tasted a few days old .
margarita was ok , not much alcohol though .
wo n't be back to this one at all .
decent place and people but a little run down .
the quality if beans are terrible .
if you like good coffee you do n't like starbucks .
i am very disappointed with my flower purchase here for mother 's day .
buying the upgraded bouquet did n't even last two days .
my general tso 's chicken was pretty nasty !
Negative
if i could give negative stars , i would .
very low tech .
so now , i do n't know if i should make another payment .
they are n't willing to work with you .
they do n't care about their customers .
honestly how dumb can you get ?
then the servers just happened to crash .
first thing i did was hang up .
a service fee to pay my freaking bill .
i also had the same experience as another reviewer on here , not good .
i was sent to the new chandler location , though .
the doctor had a bad bedside manner too , which i found weird .
three visits so unnecessary if everything had been done right the first time .
i am very disappointed with this .
this is ridiculous .
i 'm very disappointed with them .
the last band did not show up .
the front desk staff leaves a lot to be desired as well .
very professional considering i had made the appointment a month before .
it was $ _num_ .
this place was terrible .
this place had great food , but the service was horrible !
very poor service !
the cooks were n't paying attention to portion or size control .
it took _num_ minutes for our three entrees to be delivered .
our bolognese was mediocre at best .
it tasted like store bought tomato sauce , not hearty bolognese .
they brought me frozen creme brulee .
to make it even more painful , the deserts were $ _num_ each .
only good thing about the evening was the company .
no more than a few wine choices and a near empty wine wall .
we ordered _num_ appetizers and were really disappointed for $ _num_ each .
the waiter never poured the wine after the initial pour .
you wo n't get it here .
i was here last weekend and i was very disappointed .
the staff was n't very friendly .
and someone finally greeted me after i already looked around the whole store .
it looked like they had n't cleaned their cups in weeks .
i was so upset i had to get outta there .
it seems like the place is run by teenagers .
they 're not knowledgeable , not helpful and very unfriendly .
avoid them at all costs !
they have the most awkward customer service .
i hardly ever have been greeted properly .
only to be offered _num_ bucks off a new fish ?
so disappointing .
avoid , avoid , avoid .
unfortunately , i will no longer be a customer .
i then wished to cancel this order as i found one considerably cheaper .
( if the gentleman would have started it i would understand ) .
just out to make a quick buck in an expensive industry .
there is n't any customer service .
avoid at all costs .
extremely disappointed .
bad experience , bad customer service .
our old instructor mr brian was awesome .
the new teacher had no idea how to control him and just ignored him .
i had legitimate complaints and no one seemed to care .
the reason why this place get 's two stars is mr. brian .
if you do decide to go here , only go to mr. brian .
after that , quit .
the owner is really rude , worst costumer service .
yes is cheaper , but you deserve better .
so needless to say , this is no longer our vet .
maybe this is why he is not so busy .
he has no people skills and neither do a couple of his staff gals .
i told the owner hoping maybe i 'd get some sort of money back .
horrible business .
_num_ .
_num_ .
then tried to charge me more money !
_num_ .
the tux did not fit .
_num_ .
the owner was beyond rude !
incredibly unprofessional and talked bad about his previous customers .
he clearly does not appreciate your hard earned money .
trust me you are better off going anywhere else .
stay away .
i have been going here for years .
she said it could be between _num_ & _num_ dollars each kids .
i asked if she could narrow it down & she said no .
i do n't get this place .
as a parent of two small children , that is not all to reassuring .
so you might ask , why do we still go ?
this has gone to the point of absurd .
the bottom line , our end is taken care of .
they have been trained to not make appointments for people with past due accounts .
this is all according to our health care .
it 's come to the point that urgent care has become her primary place .
the staff that works there are incompetent as well .
worst experience of my life .
however , the ladies up front are terrible .
our must recent bad experience happened today .
we kept the same appointment time with another physician .
after _num_ minutes of nothing , i went to ask how much longer .
needless to say we left .
the front office staff has never even been especially personable , especially on weekends .
double ear infection , fever over _num_ and needed meds for her .
it 's terrible that they are n't there for their established patients .
the gilbert office was booked so we were referred to the chandler office .
two things that i would assume to be common since .
not planning to stay here again with so many other options .
but would like to have better lighting for business and for putting on makeup .
oh and the water is very nasty .
the central air seemed not very effective .
i was not liking that too much .
three of us stayed here for an event that was happening in mesa .
the staff at the desk was friendly and check in was very fast .
we get back _num_ hours later and it is even hotter .
which would seem more customer friendly and professional but whatever .
i woke up drenched in sweat and hearing this loud noise .
we were very disappointed when we drove up .
the hotel looked really , really old .
do not stay , horrible hotel experience .
i came back an hour later , completely unsatisfied and talked with a manager .
avoid at all cost !
manager danny rude .
there is no such law .
ghetto shit hole !
it was old and outdated , and hot !
i sent him away and told him we knew .
a few minutes later he showed back up and i gave him the info .
i also included my phone number and asked for the manager to call me .
i was n't gon na get shot !
i warn all of you do not go there .
this place is awful .
the room smelled stale and gross , and was poorly lit .
wrong !
the pool area was filthy dirty .
the bottom of the pool was also filthy .
went to work this morning hungry , exhausted , and extremely disappointed .
would never stay here again and would not recommend anyone else say here either .
waiting for a $ _num_ cab ride to another worst western motel .
this after arguing with management for _num_ hours .
the room was clean but had a strong musty odor .
i would n't stay here until they deal with their bed bug problem .
dirty , stinks horribly !
could n't wait to leave .
feels a bit run down and not cared for .
pillows small and lumpy .
breakfast mediocre .
this was the worst experience i have ever had at a hotel .
checked in to room _num_ and went to the room .
carry my stuff back down get new keys and they still do n't work .
let 's call the maintenance guy ... too late .
i stayed here friday , october _num_ , _num_ .
the motel is old point blank .
it just was n't worth what i spent .
the lighting is not the best either .
i have a severe allergy to mold and this was n't a good thing .
remove all the old interior walls and update the materials .
but still could use a little more tlc .
they did not have complimentary breakfast anywhere i could see .
i could not access any wifi .
should n't of done it .
we only stayed two nights .
my husband and i were so tired !
her attitude sucked and she 's lucky i did n't go off on her .
i sure do n't want to stay in a dirty room !
the hallway smelled like wet mold !
first of all , not sure why this is called a `` resort . ''
my room key did n't work .
they gave me another one that worked , though .
still , a pain in the butt .
oranges , apples , bananas .
also , it had only four small , really tiny pillows on the bed .
not sure why they did n't have regular sized pillows .
the next day ... there was hardly any food for breakfast .
somebody complained , and five minutes later , they brought stuff out .
overall , it just was n't a very good experience .
i tried to turn on the television and the remote control did n't work .
he said that there was nothing he could do .
i called the front desk again , only this time a girl answered .
there were bottle caps on the floor , as well as a used tissue .
they are horrible , except for one that has _num_ stars .
not a place i would stay again .
the mold and stains on everything .
in the morning we had breakfast that was not good almost inedible .
if they had an actual waitstaff it might not have been so bad .
iced tea ... no ice .
iced water ... no ice .
hot coffee served ( if you were lucky enough to get it ) cold .
no dressing on the salad .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
older guy running the bar did not care .
he is horrible with customer service .
i would stay far away from this hotel at all cost .
i ca n't believe this establishment allows this treatment .
Negative
if i could give negative _num_ stars i would .
this place is awful .
the food was cold , hard and late at the service .
apparently most people feel the same .
the thermostat is antique not even one of those old ac units .
we checked out as soon as we saw our room .
no water for _num_ hours .
then the a/c went out in our new room .
the place needs to be torn down and new buildings put up .
i saw it first had and have never witnessed such incompetence as this operation .
there is zero customer service .
even though i had a contract booked _num_ months in advance .
he said it again with the same nasty tone .
i got into my room , the wifi would n't connect .
i 'm like ... wtf ?
there is just no excuse for this .
obviously , this place does not wash their sheets .
and that is just foul !
not even a `` can i help you ?
anyway , we leave and wait to check in later .
do n't bother .
but plan to wait forever for your car .
i did not buy their tire .
i will not shop there again .
i do not recommend you go here .
the food was great , but the atmosphere was kind of annoying .
the food was ok nothing special .
their hollandaise sauce was sooo salty .
not impressed at all .
the only , and most important , problem was that the food kinda sucked .
tired .
the place seems tired .
poached eggs were severely undercooked , muffin was burned .
first , i find a bug in my water .
quite possibly the worst service in the entire town of mesa .
this place is very unimpressive .
been there twice and food was slow both times .
there was nothing special about my french toast .
it was n't horrible but it was n't good either .
not impressed at all , but i guess it will do .
_num_ scrambled eggs , bacon , english muffin and potatoes .
the eggs were disgusting , they taste watery .
the potatoes did not taste fresh , they tasted reheated .
unfortunately the dobson location of the good egg in tempe is horrible .
i cant stand servers or workers in restaurant with dirty clothes .
i did not like it at all .
i dont have crazy high expectation in food but this is disappointing .
sure do miss our old good egg .
too bad so sad to say good bye .
i 'm so bummed that first watch has ruined the good egg .
now the bacon is thin , cheap , blah bacon .
she said `` i dunno , whatever they have back there . ''
no thanks .
also , they no longer do the loyalty cards .
lame .
alas , it 's time to find a new place for pancakes .
i waited for _num_ minutes for someone to come to my table .
this has been one of our favorite breakfast places for years .
since the change we have not had _num_ good experience .
i wo n't eat and pay for cold food .
the coffee is worse than the free coffee at home depot !
pizza was okay , tasted a lot like peter piper .
just cheap pizza that is good enough to eat .
jimmy and joes pizza blows this away .
i have not encountered such poor customer service before , ever .
he was very defensive .
i only have _num_ start because i cant give zero .
when i did get the order it was completely wrong on all _num_ occasions .
just received cold pizza and under cooked bread sticks .
our office will not call or order from you again !
she put me on hold a total of _num_ times .
the delivery guy showed up , just pizza , no soda .
they messed up , and its just , sorry deal with it ?
it was completely inappropriate , and i will be following up with management soon .
when i called , they were rude .
_num_ hour and _num_ minutes for delivery when quoted _num_ minutes .
i walked in on a friday night and ordered a large pepperoni pizza .
after waiting _num_ minutes , i was given my pizza .
normally i would n't be mad , but the receipt clearly says pepperoni .
disappointed .
i just wish they were consistent at every location with quality .
holy grease balls !
the franchise manager never contacted me .
i do apologize for no one contacting you regarding this matter .
i guess your manager is just not interested .
it definitely depends on what you are looking for .
so disappointing .
i do n't see why all the positive reviews on this place .
do n't ever try to return anything to this store .
they sold me a used jazz piano book for the full $ _num_ price .
totally absurd .
shame on the music store for treating a regular customer in this manner .
if i could give this dentist no stars i would .
she has no idea how to listen to patients .
she is the worst dentist i 've ever seen .
worst experience ever .
procedure was _num_ % more than quoted .
on top of that , more procedures were added that were never discussed .
when asked why , was told there was no time .
walked out before the procedure and will not ever consider going back .
i said no thanks and walked out .
i 'm not talking bad about the pool , just stating what i experienced .
Neutral
if there were negative stars that 's what they would get .
thought it was a bit weird that the chicken was dark meat .
terrible .
my office all ordered from this awful place .
holy crap .
all the chicken and pork : overdone .
just decided to try this place tonight on a whim .
i ordered the drunken noodles and the golden tofu from the thai menu .
i will not be ordering from here again .
the person on the phone needs to learn how to communicate better .
needless to say i will never be ordering from here again .
but , frankly , i think they are just plain rude .
of all people , the service was more than lacking .
that 's very odd to me .
they did n't need to be typing away .
still no improvement , i see .
none of them seemed used to being handled .
i did n't have the heart to look at them all .
i 'm looking elsewhere .
ugh .
there is no other way to describe it .
these birds often see no human interaction for days .
but , that 's not the case at cage world .
worse : employees act like they do n't care .
when we walked in , no one greeted us .
we wandered around and went in the back area where all the cages were .
then we saw the back area where they have the boarded birds , etc .
ugh .
overly crowded is putting it mildly .
no animal should be crowded like that .
one baby had hopped up on top and later flew down to the floor .
while he walked around with us he was feeding french fries to the birds .
i feel so sorry for the birds in that store .
they usually will not ask you what you need .
this is not the only bird store in mesa .
i hated every second i lived there .
i went twice with my sin and paid _num_ more than i planned .
the name phoenix children 's has a trusted name , sure .
2nd visit _num_ week later to cast arm .
she said there is no difference in their billing , those are facility uses .
i do n't usually write this sort of review but i am so livid .
they did not get a drop of urine .
i will not recommend this urgent care to my friends and family .
their billing is by far the worst i have ever encountered .
it gets worse ... .
i 'm torn with this place .
this is where they get _num_ starts .
i am so torn with this place as another poster has said .
i could n't believe it .
and they were n't busy , like at all .
he is awful .
no kidding !
we got in quickly , waited awhile between nurses , doctor and x-rays .
overall , that part of my visit was a typical urgent care experience .
the one star is for taylor , he was helpful and polite .
i asked for a supervisor and spoke to manuel .
pathetic .
i am so disappointed .
horrible .
after checking in , we were seen by a nurse practitioner instead .
completely unnecessary !
they did not even asked for these symptoms .
no one bother to follow this as health care providers .
my daughter is fine but my bank account is not .
i am so utterly appalled by this facility .
when asked how many sandwiches they usually carry the lady told me only _num_ !
no wonder they always run out .
they are only good for making you a drink at a mediocre pace .
handle the stress ladies , its just a coffee shop .
too bad its the slowest starbucks i 've ever visited .
there is no sense of urgency when taking your order or preparing it .
just leaves me feeling frustrated .
usually starbucks will do something to make up for lack of an item .
it 's faster to drive a little bit further out to get better service .
you should n't have to wait _num_ minutes for a latte .
line out the door an _num_ people working .
step it up and hire some more people already !
this has been my experience the past _num_ times in here ... .
not the dishwasher i 'm talking about .
it took _num_ weeks and _num_ minutes on the phone to get my refund .
really they do n't install on the same day !
i wait another _num_ min and finally i get my item .
one of the worst places on earth they lied and cheated me .
then tim left me saying he had to leave .
so i had to wait for the other person to finish .
they have one of the worst customer services .
i had two tires replaced on my _num_ honda .
goes off and says let me tell the tech .
this shop in mesa is no different .
stay away from sears auto !
got there on time , dude said _num_ hour .
its a freaking oil change .
it takes _num_ minutes !
there is no sense of urgency there for customers .
i went to sears as my engine light came on .
there was only one guy at the counter nobody else came to help .
i just leave after that .
i was at discount tire earlier in the day better service and quicker .
worst service ever !
buy your books from amazon its cheaper and better return policy !
worst place ever .
i paid $ _num_ for it .
they took all the edge off and made it a flat surface .
unfortunately i wo n't be shopping here .
i 've been in _num_ times and left empty handed .
this is that goodwill .
terrible customer service !
probably never coming back .
heads up , $ _num_ off coupon here they will not honor .
games are over priced and half of them do n't work .
place was way understaffed .
there were no table waitresses .
the lanes that are currently open are for league players .
the wait period is roughly _num_ minutes . ''
this is now completely unfair to the people she initially turned away .
of course there is now another `` _num_ minute waiting period . ''
do not make it up as you go .
that to me shows poor customers services .
_num_ minutes away .
there was the first alarm , why was it packed so late ?
that would 've been wonderful information to have .
the management needs to start training better here .
word can spread pretty fast if a place has horrid customer service .
terrible customer service .
will not come back .
staff was of poor quality .
even manager was of no help .
they lost out on what is now an over three month rental .
the reason for the low rating is the actual cars .
never had a problem .
went there today and was treated like garbage .
no smile from the rep , just asked , what do you want ?
they are horrible !
rent a car from any other place .
they refuse to give me my deposit on the car back .
absolutely miserable and frustrating experience .
i called as soon as i left because the tire light came on .
super annoyed at this experience .
i will never rent a car from this place again .
rude horrible service .
called and spoke to someone whose name i dont remember .
$ _num_ for a plain metal key is obnoxious .
terrible service !
i will not be going back to this office ever .
especially after _num_ years and thousands of dollars of business they got from me .
not to mention the office is tiny and very dirty !
i did n't even want to sit down in the waiting room .
there was a mix up with my appointment date , mistake on their part .
the dr looked he was annoyed to treat me .
call back and wait an hour with no response .
this place sucks i am a person and will not be treated this way .
but then there is now way to change an appt .
not even an email address from their web page .
the worst you can imagine .
there is a reason they can get you in fairly quickly .
without going into details i would say keep looking better options are out there .
i will not being going back and would never refer anyone to this clinic .
he completely ignored the next patient to check in as well .
could n't even be bothered to look up .
i then waited an additional hour just to be called into an exam room .
by shortly i guess he meant an additional _num_ minutes .
my experience is not a novelty visit like some posts on here .
and frankly , miserable - all or most of the time .
i 'm lucky if i can walk my dog for _num_ minutes .
it was not a nice office , nor were they nice to me .
sugar attracts more flies than vinegar .
can i give them _num_ stars ?
i am not going to see the same doctor .
probably the most unprofessional call i 've ever experienced .
so i called back , _num_ minutes later with the dr .
she was a bit nicer .
all ra patients are suffering due to his quit .
the staff at this facility is just awful .
she could care less and told me they 'd get to me .
very rude , unprofessional staff makes this a place i 'd never return to .
i made an appointment that was about _num_ weeks out .
!
we can forward your medical records to them .
this is the worst office to go to .
the staff is unfriendly and unprofessional .
find another dr immediately .
i finally got pissed threw the menus on the counter walked out .
wrong .
rude !
he was as cranky as the _num_ year old .
i know i wo n't be back , and neither will my daughter .
nobody ever died from being nice .
the guy that seated us was n't personable at all .
food was really bland .
however , the service was awful .
the food was just blah , prices were definitely a rip off .
not crispy bacon means the bacon will bend !
for that reason alone , i will never go back there .
i 'm sure it was the style in _num_ or so .
but ambiance was not the low spot .
it was n't bad per se , but it was n't good either .
we left with the hungry feeling gone but certainly no feeling of satisfaction either .
visit # _num_ extremely poor service .
the waitress was rude and obviously poorly trained .
so did not get my soup or salad .
we ate our pies with no drink .
hard to finish without liquid .
just horrible service and not so great food at this village inn .
been coming here once a week for _num_ months .
chicken fried steak and eggs was my fave .
_num_ minutes for water and i could count the guests on one hand .
runny eggs and the steak was pure salt .
she left the receipt without a word .
too bad , losing my favorite morning spot .
very short review , village inn let down today .
this is probably the first time it has happened .
however , no longer will that be the case .
took a long time for anyone to come over to get our drinks .
being my birthday i was really craving crepes .
its something i only get on special occasions .
i was really excited to get them .
wait , wait , waiting .
bummer the service is so slow today .
i was in no hurry so i could wait .
my husband refused his sandwich and we left .
so disappointed .
the service is pretty slow .
i could have and should have gone to mimi 's cafe .
it 's kind of busy , but not that busy .
_num_ minutes still no service ... .
really sorry .
gross !
without a doubt , the single worst restaurant meal i have ever been served .
my review : _num_ ) eggs ordered as over medium were over hard .
literally cold , watery , and with no flavor .
to label this as huevos rancheros is an insult to hispanic culture .
no second chances here .
terrible service !
... out of _num_ ... only _num_ ordered food .
so if you are alone do n't go here .
service was terrible .
our server rachel , did n't know what she was doing and unfriendly .
took over _num_ minutes to get our food , restaurant was empty .
wait staff was inattentive , and had lack of knowledge of the menu .
food was bland .
good was not good , except for the pie .
no flavor and just weird texture .
based on my experience here , no wonder they are going out of business !
if i need more surgery i definitely will not go back .
it not like i wan na pocket a _num_ dollar nail art !
do not buy an animal here unless you want to risk them being sick !
they have less than _num_ % of life than any other type of lighting .
such a disappointment !
my son is _num_ .
he has horrible bedside manner !
i can not tell you enough about what a jerk he was !
i was thinking , why ca n't my waitress just take it ?
i was appalled but regardless i yelled back my order across the room .
this is not the way ordering should work .
i asked if it was peking chicken , and she said yes .
anyway , the smell was really nasty .
it was that bad .
but i needed my bill .
my waitress did n't do anything .
worst chinese food i ever had , bad service , and under portioned .
have been coming to golden canyon for at least _num_ years .
the food has always been exceptional but the service has been poor at best .
however , the service was terrible !
very poor staff training .
have been coming to golden canyon for at least _num_ years .
the food has always been exceptional but the service has been poor at best .
however , the service was terrible !
very poor staff training .
service was better than before but still mediocre at best .
chicken was way overlooked .
hubby 's lemon chicken had very little sauce also and was dry .
after all these years the place has gone downhill .
because of the language barrier they can seem a little rough around the edges .
i am rating strictly on my experience today with take out .
the food was excellent , the service was ridiculous .
i walked in to get my food which was sitting there .
did n't say hi , just named my food and the dollar amount .
seriously , how rude .
we have been going to golden canyon chinese for _num_ years .
hardly a veggie in their food .
we stopped in at golden canyon on saturday feb _num_ for a friends birthday .
we then waited another _num_ minutes to for her to take our order .
it seems the staff was busy counting cookies and not waiting on tables .
if i want rude service , i will go to a fast food place .
the employees are unfriendly and the place needs an update .
the bathrooms are a disaster and dirty .
maybe not , but sadly i wo n't ever go back now .
crab puffs were the only good part of meal .
bathroom was terrible .
wo n't be back .
was disappointed .
no one in dining area .
got our drinks quickly .
food was mediocre .
chicken marsala needed more sauce and mushrooms .
it was too late to order anything else .
not good food or service for the prices .
what a crap experience !
horrible horrible service !
i spoke too soon .
went back and they cheated me on a whole chicken sandwich .
i guess an ultimate sausage burrito does n't come with sausage .
pull your heads out of your pathetic exit holes and get your act together .
- something like that is very unpleasant , all the time .
she does n't like people to browse and look at stuff to get ideas .
she wants you to quickly buy what you will and then get out .
i want to go the distance , to another place next time .
i just have n't got much good to say about going here .
i walked out without being so much as greeted .
my lil man came in with a temp of _num_ when _num_ was normal .
i was so worried and started crying in his office .
horrible !
never bring your pet to this place .
they are not trustworthy or loving to pets at all .
this took less then _num_ minutes and she walked out .
anyway neither of us will be going back .
ridiculous !
anyway neither of us will be going back .
ridiculous !
they have no respect for you or your pet .
i called _num_ days ago , they had to ask the dr of course .
not even one once of good advice .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
this place is empty for a reason .
my advise find another black owned barbershop to go to .
first of all , every single barber is slow .
bad business , you should be taking care of customers .
or maybe we 're the idiots .
do not go here to get your haircut .
no name tag so i do n't know his name .
i suggest albertsons for all meat purchases .
i have been using this pharmacy practically my entire life .
she 's rude .
she lacks personality and a tiny customer service smile .
i dread picking up prescription from her .
i have three dogs and five cats and they are my children !
finally , they refused to provide me with my dog 's prescriptions to refill !
cheap breakfast that is mediocre .
the service is mediocre .
the bathroom is stinky , i had to hold my breathe .
just ordered _num_ pies for thanksgiving .
terrible !
pecan pie filling was so chewy it had to be thrown away !
upon entering the restaurant i had a bad feeling .
the windows carpet and booths could have all used a good cleaning .
it was immediately clear we had made a huge mistake .
no thinly sliced prime rib and no mushrooms .
the check was n't even brought to the table .
nobody knew how to run the cash register .
took me over _num_ minutes to get my change and be out of there .
pies were the worst i 've ever eaten .
crunchy and not ripe whatsoever .
hardly any flavor and the skins were tough and bitter .
we all got sick from it .
i will never return to this establishment .
this is the second ( and last ) time i 've come here .
the muffin came out quickly and was decent .
in fact i had to go to the register to get my check .
the steak was horribly fatty .
she acknowledged that it did not look fresh .
she squeezed out an apology .
consider yourself warned .
the service completely sucked !
i was extremely offended .
they did not call me to let me know .
and they could not accommodate my appointment with another masseuse .
so i left my scheduled appointment with no massage .
i signed online to schedule an appt .
is closed for renovations this week .
if not , you were probably transferred to a different therapist .
if you want deep tissue , book him .
i provided direct feedback through the massage envy survey six days ago .
i will never go to this massage envy again !
once i got there the masseuse was rude to me .
i do n't care just let me relax !
that is not how that process was originally explained to me .
my _num_ month old son was very sick .
he did n't even check his temperature .
i waited _num_ minutes to be seen which is ridiculous .
do n't waste your time !
cost might be low but they do not stand behind their products !
more like a big corporate machine that does n't care about their customers !
however , most of your employees are extremely rude .
recently i went in with my dog .
i will not be back .
what a mistake as i should of checked yelp before wasting my time .
also , we might have drinking water but , that is it .
desert trees are only what he has in his yard as he told me .
this employee either is taking too many meds or not enough .
i go every january and february to get my veggies not this coming year .
worse customer service !
)
poor service today .
i run up to the door and ... .
if you close before _num_ _num_ than change your hours to reflect that !
staff ignored me .
after _num_ minutes of waiting i just left the store .
chipped and missing concrete as you walk up .
yes , he had the bally 's red shirt , but no id .
they are not parent friendly !
not female friendly !
there are no female trainers at all .
_num_ months , nothing has changed .
i was disappointed that there were no weekend hours .
the play area was just a few balls and some toys and a tv .
they showed no interest in my concerns or having me as a member .
things get fixed fairly quickly .
_num_ .
an apathetic staff -- i think just two people knew my name .
_num_ .
but i get to pay the same , of course .
_num_ .
there is usually a wait , especially in winter .
bland , overpriced , and nothing special .
the last two visits we have made have both been for birthday dinners .
unfortunately it was n't .
i 'm hoping someone in our party had mashed potatoes .
poor birthday guy got the most pathetic and tired birthday song ever .
it may have tasted better if the experience was better .
disappointing especially since were were the first table today .
the service is so bad at this location that we will not return .
unfortunately there is nothing on their menu that i can not live without .
but this time the salad was not good .
very mushy .
soup was good but deep fried asparagus was stuck together in a block .
the food on the other hand was not so great .
the portions are smaller , and the chicken alfredo barely had chicken .
along with , the chicken alfredo was missing something .
but not great to me .
strike _num_ the brown ass breadsticks that tasted burnt .
those were the worse breadsticks i 've ever had from og .
maybe they would 've been better .
went to get the soup and salad today and it was a disaster .
finally a server walked by and noticed we had not been helped .
he did n't seem to care .
this was a crappy experience .
terrible !
we will not go back .
service wasnt all that great this time .
i would opt out in eating chicken and steak here .
man , my visit here was sad .
: ( rosemary chicken needed more sauce as well .
the tiramisu was gross .
even the breadsticks which could have been a plus were stale and cold .
terrible service .
seriously worst service i have ever had .
every time i go to this olive garden it seems something always goes wrong .
however , after my last visit i will not be back .
i will not be back !
the food does n't taste like normal food .
they do n't use salt in their pasta .
honestly the food was great but horrible service from this one waitress .
the service was questionable and it honestly ruined my my experience .
will not come back .
in the last few years i 've tried my best to like this place .
it tasted like a frozen dinner that i could buy at frys .
i bought _num_ meals for _num_ dollars and did not like either .
i will be choosing to spend my money elsewhere .
sorry olive garden .
worst dining experience .
so we ended up getting there a _num_ to wait .
she put us down , but when she did it was for _num_ people .
she seemed very confused by her job .
she never asked for our name or gave an estimated wait time .
after _num_ minutes of waiting she told us our table was being set up .
i said i guess , even though it was canceled .
_num_ minutes and no one comes with boxes .
extremely disappointed with service .
would not recommend .
service is always adequate but the server tonight ( matt ) was dreadful .
he handled himself very poorly and was very short with me and my wife .
it took _num_ minutes to receive refills on our drinks .
with the service we received i wish there were buttons worse than very unsatisfied .
we picked up some togo food tonight from olive garden .
it sounded like something went wrong with an order or employee or something .
i feel bad for the people working there .
i would hate to work with her .
foods still bomb though .
the waitress was nice , but seemed really stressed and in a hurry .
the problem was that they had flies in the restaurant .
that is a bad sign if there are bugs inside the place .
terrible waitress , she likes to ignore you .
if you sit around the bar area you wo n't always get good service .
my experience at the gilbert location was awesome compared to this one .
fist time i was there someone threatened to shoot up the place .
the service is nonexistent .
and whats with the crappy service ? ''
no bitch , you need to do your job !
they are n't bright !
they are rude !
it was ok , but definitely nothing to write home about .
but there was nothing that ever would draw me back here again .
this night , sarah served my first beer .
keep in mind , i am by myself at the end of the bar .
small hole in the wall bar that smells of urine and body odor .
this joint attracts shady characters because of their cheap prices .
not a place to go alone to have a drink .
she told the bartender and she did n't do nothing about it .
cheap drinks and full of native americans .
this place is not for me .
bartender ignored me for at least _num_ minutes and was pretty rude about it .
this place is horrible !
no one there deserves my money and $ _num_ tip .
i 'm not new to mediterranean food .
however , this was my first attempt at eating falafel .
here it 's horrible .
tasteless even with the sauce .
so i ca n't explain the falafel failure .
as far as atmosphere goes , it 's lacking a bit .
i ca n't recommend this place for a date or for families .
it 's just mediocre .
they have forgotten who keeps them in business , it is paying customers .
they have forgotten who keeps them in business , it is paying customers .
service is all over the place .
inconsistent .
why not treat all of your customers that way ?
inconsistent quality of food .
but then a month later my falafel sandwich was a dismal disappointment .
i complained to the waitress expecting a brand new falafel wrap to be made .
plus it was overly cooked ( crispy & burnt ) .
food was okay , shawarma was n't shaved it seemed like carne asada .
customer service _num_ out _num_ !
their selection was incredibly limited .
the food was not memorable .
she would n't even check to see if the frames are in stock .
completely lack of customer service .
other salespeople are just standing there .
i go to the back to wait for my husband to get done .
doc is not rude , just apathetic .
no apology for poor customer service .
there was no excuse .
i was in the office purchasing my glasses for _num_ hours !
& they wanted to charge me almost $ _num_ for _num_ pairs of glasses .
before insurance this would have been $ _num_ .
my rx is very week .
i was in there for _num_ minutes .
she is condescending , impatient , and apathetic at best .
it was not edible .
i have eaten chinese in hawaii , japan and california .
i really wanted to like this place , but i could n't .
sorry , golden gate ... .
golden gate is very disappointing .
the food was thoroughly unremarkable .
it was n't served with any type of dipping sauce .
the entrees looked like _num_ % frozen meats and sauces .
they were absolutely artificial and flavorless .
the place really needs to catch up about _num_ years .
in that , i was not disappointed .
i was , however , disappointed with the food , sadly .
but truly , the food was not good .
in fact , my egg foo young tasted a little spoiled .
i threw it away and ate the friend won tons they gave us .
even the spicy dishes tasted rather bland .
not like it used to be .
my dining companion had the garlic chicken and it was a little slimy .
too bad .
you 've been warned !
place is horrible ... service was terrible and everyone was downright rude .
same as it was _num_ years ago .
went for lunch after recently returning to the valley of the sun .
not much to write about my lunch .
portion was small .
boring .
the bathroom opens to the dining area , so that made it seem worse .
probably wont be back .
disappointing .
man this place was so dirty .
huge crumbs all over the floor , dirty plates .
never coming back , come here if you like dirty stuff .
possibly the worst chinese i 've ever had .
i ca n't believe this place had decent yelp reviews .
i feel like a stone cold sucker !
my friend and i were the only ones there .
the food was mediocre .
the rice was cold .
the only thing i managed to eat with no problem were the crab angels .
over all , just not a good experience .
would rather have spent so much money elsewhere !
when i got there , i waited for _num_ mins to place an order .
not worth $ _num_ after taxes .
no acknowledgement for _num_ min .
it 's not even busy .
_num_ minutes later .
it was pathetic .
i 'm pretty sure you should n't leave a massage feeling pissed off .
!
i told him , `` no , someone confirmed it was cancelled . ''
i feel so sorry for his employees !
if he treats customers like this , imagine how he treats staff .
completely absurd customer service !
will be filing a report with the bbb !
i call to make sure the time is available , then it 's not .
poor professionalism .
such poor customer service and this place is a joke .
this place is the worst !
if i could post no stars , i would !
the past few years the entire office has gone downhill right before our eyes .
my wait was _num_ hours .
not even kidding .
worse experience at a dr office ever .
would n't go back if they paid me .
would highly recommend avoiding at all costs .
rude staff , incompetent nurse practitioner .
do n't get anything waxed there .
she did n't listen to my request at all !
i guess i 'm better off wearing a hat .
as for the salon itself , everyone else was courteous and clean .
i 'd have to say that i 'm pretty disappointed in this one .
it looked very run down .
also , the selection of gel polish colors was dismal .
the filing job on my nails was so incredibly sloppy .
( this completely irritated me the entire time i had the nails on ! )
so i really needed a fill and color today .
i dont know why , but i just ca n't get into them ) .
i guess i just do n't fit into the mold .
i ordered a combo plate , trying a beef enchilada and a chicken taco .
both were average ... nothing to write home about .
why did each adult couple have _num_ kids with them ?
this is very bland , americanized mexican food .
this place looks very dirty .
i did eat there , though , and the food was pretty mediocre .
nothing had much flavor or spice .
i would not come here again .
i finally asked our waitress for some as she walked by .
i was mildly annoyed .
in my opinion this is n't always a good thing .
was this bad ?
he 's _num_ , he likes `` mildly seasoned '' .
the bill came to $ _num_ and some change .
all i can say is very bland !
their chicken fajita bowl had no flavor and their spanish rice was so so .
wo n't be returning .
the service _num_ out of _num_ times is not good .
she did n't seem to do anything right .
not sure how he is even a mgr .
i cant think of any reason that would be acceptable .
we got _num_ percent off .
but so me one please give me a reason why i should go back ?
thank fully i did not get sick .
sat there for _num_ minutes after we finished eating .
each diet pepsi ( which were flat ) cost $ _num_ .
no refills were offered .
my huevos was around $ _num_ .
but we wo n't be back .
thumbs down for this place .
i was craving mexican food .
chicken taco tasted like it came out of the can .
our selection for tonight was rosita 's .
the pricing for most of the menu very over priced .
the whole reason to dine out is to be served and taken care of .
bald dude with glasses clearly does not know how to offer this .
no one wants to hear your excuses and your flat out no .
it was mediocre at best .
unfortunately , the food and service were less than decent .
my boyfriend and i were extremely impressed with how terrible it was .
for $ _num_ .
for rice and beans ... ... seriously ?
my chicken tacos tasted like they came straight out of a can .
four tacos for $ _num_ .
no problem paying $ _num_ there for one .
dude just needed to listen better .
food came out extremely quick , soon enough i 'd realize why .
this little guy had an undercooked tortilla and not very much carnitas .
$ _num_ for a tortilla and meat .
mexican food ai n't fancy food .
she was sitting at a desk in the middle of their building .
i guess i should not have expected to be treated with respect or professionalism .
again , i was n't even offered the courtesy of a chair .
thank goodness i walked out and found the mark dealerships instead !
they would n't even honor their own prices posted in the car .
and at all costs stay away from dave the sales man .
worse attitude ever .
he completely ruined my car buying experience .
dave was unfriendly , did n't have the right information and pushy !
on the other hand ... dave the finance guy was a god sent .
this is the second time i 've gotten shit from these guys .
i 'm very disappointed in this place .
very poor service .
it got so bad that my key would n't even work anymore .
carl promised me certain things if i bought a car and did not deliver .
would not recommend this place to anyone .
i am contacting the better business bureau .
i wish they were a reputable dealership .
should maybe take in to consideration that she has a customer waiting .
this place is a complete disaster .
the lady who cut my hair clearly did not want to be working there .
she did a terrible job on my hair .
she was incredibly rude also , very arrogant .
what a complete waste of money .
one of the bottom _num_ restaurants in my entire life .
_num_ ) the place is filthy .
_num_ ) the girl at the counter was rude .
_num_ ) i ordered kung pao chicken .
it was neither kung pao or teriyaki .
horrible horrible establishment .
this was not the case but the least of this restaurant 's problems .
my eating partner just had an egg drop soup .
it was not over fried .
i did not eat it .
does that also mean not good ?
anyway , this is not a place where i will ever be seen again .
the food is just too sub-par .
frankly , i do n't know how they stay in business .
there is nothing here that you want .
ordered _num_ chicken dishes .
could not eat anything that i ordered .
ca n't believe they stay in business .
lame school .
waste of time and money .
i was wrong .
the pants were replaced on the spot .
you ca n't button your jacket properly without it !
i try to give businesses the benefit of the doubt .
we began looking at ties , still no greeting .
the people that work here only care about commission and not the customer .
save your time and money and try another location .
the representative who helped me kept bringing me more and more shirts .
_num_ stars given for the attitude when i came to do a return .
i had a $ _num_ shirt that did n't fit .
they are practically identical shirt in a slightly different fabric ) .
this annoyed me , considering how much money i spend there regularly .
they did n't seem to pick up at that .
you have lost someone in the business that would bring in more business .
no stars from me !
after _num_ minutes said she could finally take care of us .
here is where it gets bad .
right off the bat i could tell that she worked off of commission .
do you really need to be that desperate ?
only myself and one other customer were there .
i should have just stayed at home and ordered it online .
please be aware that this is not an at & t company store !
these associates are not even at & t trained .
yelp says it opens at 9am .
google says it opens at 10am .
so i went at _num_ am .
wasted my time there .
i wo n't waste my precious time going to look .
i walked into this store to buy chocolates for mother 's day .
at that point , i paid for my box of chocolates .
not the worst experience but for sure the worst quality .
i had to request the design for be removed because it was so sloppy .
maybe it 's just me , but gross .
at checkout i was told about their _num_ week return policy .
after _num_ or _num_ runs , i noticed it was already coming apart .
not the board , swim deck , boat , or anything .
the answer was still no .
no dice .
i went in looking for ski boots that would fit a very narrow foot .
i 'm really not sure how much he heard .
i do not know if they get commission or not .
honestly most people would not have noticed until it was too late .
too busy today .
these guys are moving slow and i 'm ready to go .
i would not eat food here but for live music its ok .
the sound quality here is just ok , it could be a lot better .
for the love of god , avoid at all costs .
horrible does n't even begin to cover the awful service of this place .
i walked in to get a mani/pedi with my friend .
my pedicure was $ _num_ .
( and acted like it was me being high maintenance ) .
_num_ times .
_num_ times !
ugh .
horrible customer service .
i do not recommend this company .
1st off , , , staff there is stellar .
left with nothing .
took hours to get him ready !
this place is horrible !
as i walked in the store , the counter guy was on the phone .
wrong !
the majority of it is _num_ 's & _num_ 's rock .
i was very disappointed .
however ; dee 's was n't worth my time .
the staff is much friendlier at barry 's too .
really !
bad business all around !
this is a place to stay away from .
barry is not .
i miss fiesta mall .
the fact that you ca n't use debit outside is a little annoying .
fix your debit machine on the pumps or at least require a zip code !
then you 're stuck with it whether you like it or not .
bubbles of joy is lame .
all she had was an extremely unfriendly and rude personality .
it was not busy at all .
no one at the counter which you can see from the drive thru .
so now , i do n't have time to drive back .
i waited one minute and nothing .
stopped here in a hurry and ... we deeply regretted it .
i went here hoping to find something affordable as i was low on money .
there was a lot of profit in that little burrito .
she then tries to sell me an additional test that will cost $ _num_ .
sorry , but not a fan .
in the end , the manager gave me $ _num_ off .
additionally , the staff were pushy and a little on the rude side .
overall i would not recommend this place .
worst customer service i have ever seen at any business .
they will do anything they can to avoid helping their waiting customers .
the workers were nice ; however , the wait really was n't worth it .
this place is so crowded .
went to the appointment and everyone upfront was extremely friendly .
she answered annoyed that once they were open i could n't do either .
they just replaced the lens with the same script .
i paid close to $ _num_ for a membership and i still get ignored .
so , now that it 's my last year , i have had it .
the hours clearly say they open at nine .
valentine 's day is not a national holiday .
this is the worst apartment i have ever lived in .
the area it 's in is practically dying and it 's very unsafe .
the staff is the worst part .
they treated me horribly .
when i talk to my neighbors everybody feels the same towards the management .
supposedly to save money they replaced bathroom doors with curtains .
they do a horrible job of picking up garbage .
they said we turned the ac down to low and it broke .
we are n't mechanics we do n't know how to handle an ac machine .
things i never thought would happen , happened .
i also had a lot of problems with the washer and dryers .
half the time they were broken and would take my money .
the other half of the time they did n't work very well .
now the my biggest problem , their service and manners .
if you need help over the phone it is even worse .
my advice would be to just not do it .
i 've called the leasing office several times and nothing has yet been resolved .
plan on taking extra money these machines constantly break down and take your money .
i 'm starting to regret i even considered calling this apt my home .
no cleanliness is applied here .
there was no care taken , no massage , nothing .
then she did my wife 's hand nails for almost _num_ hours .
worst manicure and pedicure experience i have ever had .
then , when she went to pain i was appalled .
no biggie .
i will not have them back !
you could cal and call and got no answer from the salesman .
after finally fixing gates so they operated properly , they wanted final payment .
this was an $ _num_ job !
i would highly recommend using a different company for your garage door needs .
they wo n't even respond to my emails .
very disappointing experience .
even for fast food i just ca n't stomach it .
so we wait .
_num_ minutes roll by .
then _num_ minutes later , we get our food .
then when we saw what we had received , oh we were disappointed .
did n't bother us as much as our burger .
jalapeno poppers ( _num_ ) had a bitter taste .
$ _num_ which someone would open a decent fast food on this corner .
and a friend of mine .
so they scammed me but whatever !
do not visit this location !
went to try those pretzel hotdogs , and the bun was all moldy .
horrible place .
first of all , sonic is n't really great in the first place .
?
so if you are craving sonic , just go to a different location .
this one however , is the worst location i have ever eaten at .
the food is extremely inconsistent .
i do n't feel like paying for a single tiny brownie thrown in there .
but i 'm not going to expect quality .
very poor service .
we probably wo n't be back .
so sad cause we like sonic .
this is the worst sonic i have been to .
this week was the last try - they had no ice .
if i could give less than _num_ star i would .
i only got a medium strawberry limeade .
dumped it all out and found lettuce in it .
i 'm never coming back here again .
one word for this place - nasty .
worst hamburgers in mesa period !
today - nasty .
that 's assuming waste my money at another sonic .
this location will never get my business again .
they offered to swap it out for a comparable item , and we agreed .
said item was $ _num_ more .
so annoyed .
by far the worst sonic i have ever been to .
the worst experience i have ever had anywhere .
pressed the order button waited _num_ minutes and no response .
no response again .
pressed the button no response for _num_ more minutes .
this is officially the last time i will ever come here .
received a cherry slush and cold , stale half filled fries .
what the actual hell .
tater tots are very cold and very old .
diet coke was flat .
my burger was n't fully cooked , 3/4 pink .
i most likely will not return here .
i think i 'm probably done with the chain at this point .
so , i was very excited to find this place .
we arrived around 9:30 a.m. to find empty shelves !
what bakery has empty shelves at 9:30 in the morning ?
but , no .
very bland .
i gave them _num_ stars because of the sweet woman behind the counter .
avoid this place at all costs .
i '' m sorry , i do n't know this entire store .
however , the depot used to have a fairly knowledgeable staff .
i also would like to say that it 's not just this store either .
sadly , this was the past .
thanks , never would have noticed it otherwise .
sadly , i knew nothing about concrete so i went with his advice .
not only was it the wrong stuff , it was a waste of money .
now do n't get me wrong .
over the past year , their propane exchange kiosk has only worked once .
how rude !
counted _num_ people in line for self check no registers open .
i found this rude ... and annoying !
oh , and he did n't even know the right prices .
i will not be back !
i paid _num_ dollars for this water container and it did n't function properly .
this is not a way to treat customers .
i wish i could give zero stars .
i honestly do n't know which is worse ... _num_ ) the water quality .
_num_ ) the cleanliness .
_num_ ) water bottles .
what a ripoff .
i got screwed $ _num_ .
pizza hut is terrible !
i tried their `` pizza mia '' in march , and it was horrible .
big mistake .
i 've never had such a bad pizza in my life .
how does that all come out so horrible ?
then just last weekend i ordered a different pizza because they were on sale .
big mistake !
a lady did , and she was horrible with the customer service .
she never once apologized that it took _num_ months to get back to me !
lame .
there are too many other pizza places out there .
i 'm not falling for pizza hut 's cheap prices anymore .
i ordered online and chose a future delivery time of _num_ pm .
the first time we ordered and had it delivered , everything was awesome .
omg , really ?
umm , no .
the last three orders from this pizza hut delivery have been incorrect .
2nd was pizza not well done as requested .
then 3rd was tonight , forgot an order of breadsticks , i ordered two .
i also did not receive the sauce with the breadsticks .
was disappointed for the 3rd time in a row .
there will not be a 4th .
ordered _num_ hand tossed pizzas and a few other things .
the crust was like a pizza stone .
the driver also could n't be bothered to even pull the items out .
horrible pizza as well as service .
my pizza is dry , over cooked , no sauce whatsoever and burned crust .
took _num_ minutes for delivery on an average thursday .
wo n't be ordering from here again .
the store does nothing to stop this .
bad choice .
our sushi appetizer was extremely ordinary , the yellowtail seemed dry and tasteless .
more expensive than most of the sushi places in mesa .
i would not go back , very poor value .
their food and service what we paid for was ridiculous .
if i could give this less then _num_ star i would .
the chef came out then promptly dumped the veggies and raw meat together .
food was ok , nothing special .
the dog sat on her lap while they ate .
however , we all get sick after eating here every time .
this place deserves zero stars .
they would n't honor the lunch prices or apologize for the mistake .
the lunch crowd was sparse ( two other tables other than us ) .
it was very disappointing .
i ordered a soft shell crab roll and it was also disappointing .
the eel sauce was bitter ( probably from burnt sugar ) and too salty .
i also ordered the chicken katsu and the chicken was dry and overcooked .
our bill came to $ _num_ including tip .
the drinks took forever , and then my order was incorrect .
when i told her , she near argued with me .
sorry but we will not be back .
i knew it was bad the first time i tried it .
are you looking for the cure for your sushi cravings ?
do you wish that you could be permanently rid of your roll addiction ?
worst place ever if you 're pregnant .
refuses to make sushi for pregnant women .
at this point , we both lost our appetite .
also there is not enough room around the tables .
then businesses wonder why they are going under .
apparently it 's not that common here on the west coast .
unfortunately , the custard itself was just not the same .
it tasted like plain ol ' chocolate ice cream .
this is no where near the same as the gilbert location .
the sauce was not listed in the ingredients on the menu .
it was not just hot , but tasted bad .
i visited the location on gilbert and southern tonight .
the sundae was completely melted and my fried were overcooked .
the place smelled and was dirty .
the food was over priced and tasted bland .
the concrete was okay , nothing special .
this is place will close down before to long .
at over $ _num_ a container it was very disappointing .
we will not be coming here in the future .
we were very disappointed when it came .
terrible service and the custard was very runny .
the only places i see doing that are gas stations in the ghetto .
so disappointing .
but the service needs to be a focus in this place .
it was completely overpriced and worst frozen custard i 've ever had .
the manager was not understanding or sympathetic about the problem at all .
bad management kinda killed the whole experience for my spouse and i .
just overall horrible experience and will never go back !
went in at lunch time and it was completely empty .
everything was way overpriced and not a very good selection .
i wo n't go back .
instead it was hot , sticky and overall a really unpleasant experience .
it 's a brioche bun that 's kind of hard .
fries tasted like they were frozen , definitely nothing special .
the iced tea tasted very old and nasty .
also , the `` what ? ''
its not like i just spent over _num_ bucks at your establishment or anything .
i 'll drive a little farther to have better a shooting experience .
that was it , i was done .
no carrying in shooting range , please !
range is cramped and there is no room to move .
i wo n't be back .
worst attitude from this guy than i would ever expect from an employee .
mind you we told him we have zero experience with guns .
as which gun he would advise for a new shooter .
so at this point i did n't even want to be there .
employees like to act as if they know everything and the customer knows nothing !
i had purchased an online coupon quite a long time ago .
very disappointed in this business today .
ok i 'm sorry , really ?
this review concerns a visit i made to the store approximately _num_ weeks ago .
i wo n't be back .
wanted to try this place out so i went there the other day .
horrible customer service !
the ground beef had no flavor whatsoever -- no seasoning at all .
i was so disappointed though !
chips and salsa are complimentary .
i was disappointed .
we will not be coming back .
pale and tasteless , the burrito was very disappointing .
my wife chose a bean , egg , and cheese , breakfast burrito .
what could go wrong with that , right ?
no , i think out of the can may have a bit more taste .
even their guacamole was bland .
i walked in , ordered some food to go .
worst customer service i have ever received .
the employees did n't stop talking to assist us .
this is the worst starbucks i 've ever been to .
everytime i go their they get my order wrong and they are slow .
i waited _num_ minutes for my drink .
disgusting !
my latte tasted horrible and was definitely a waste of $ _num_ .
i keep forgetting to not come back to this starbucks .
i will not be coming back here .
horrible experience at this starbucks , all around .
duh , the more expensive one , the protein bistro .
_num_ and still showed an available award .
then several hours later the balance was _num_ and no remaining rewards .
there just always seems to be something unpleasant everytime i go to this location .
it 's a shame because this is on my way to work .
that 's not what i wanted .
i 'm sure they wo n't mind me taking a look .
if not , i 'll head back to la which i highly recommend .
what a waste of time .
you are a horrible company !
manager told me he was going to cancel membership , failed to do so .
he does n't even have the balls to call me .
even machines that work could use maintenance .
come to find out they never canceled the membership .
i really wish i did n't have to give them one star .
worst management ever if this is the face of your establishment !
but if you are even remotely considering going to this gym .
do yourself a favor and do n't waste your time here .
equipment is old dirty .
if you try to cancel it is a big run around .
then he let me know that i was n't really that committed .
to gold 's , no .
nor to any other gym the first time i walk in it .
parking sucks .
rude !
he then seemed annoyed but gave me a tour when i insisted .
( insulting another gym ) .
i got so irritated i left before my workout was complete .
quite possibly the worst gold 's gym ever .
the layout of the place is terrible , too .
in the end it was just cheaper to pay them .
seriously , if i could give this gym a zero , i would .
this gym only cares about its numbers .
these places are not exceptional at all .
how about the $ _num_ minimum to get in ?
way overpriced , extreme unhealthy food choices ?
or sitting through 20-30 mins of ads ?
the sound was n't impressive .
people can walk by you and you do n't even have to move .
i did n't get any snacks so ca n't comment on the concession stand .
the staff that was there that day was horrible .
they do n't move and are super uncomfortable .
they only have one day a week for the student pricing .
their 3d movies seem to be outrageously priced .
very rude .
almost all of the stalls had something gross in them .
hardly anyone there at all on a saturday night at 8pm .
i just had the worst movie night in my life .
all the customers at the movie theater were high and jerks .
probably the last time we visit an amc theater .
it 's a shame because i have fond memories of amc .
i walked up and simply asked , excuse me , what 's your name ?
ok ... jim ... then asked why ?
because , i frankly do n't !
afternoon after _num_ pm is outrageous .
my complaint is that they were not telling people in line .
very poor customer service .
took _num_ minutes to get a ticket and popcorn .
no more than _num_ people came i or out .
wo n't be going back .
no discounts for students & popcorn was stale !
they actually charge more than harkins !
probably the worst seats i 've ever sat in .
my back is still killing me .
smaller theater , late showing .
the soda tasted like plastic and the popcorn did n't have any flavor .
the movie volume was very low for some reason .
ticket and concession service slow .
very sad place to go to now and it 's so overpriced .
seats are so uncomfortable and everything is so over priced .
we had n't been there in some time and we wo n't be back .
not at those prices .
there was nobody there on a friday night .
the workers were friendly but the theater was run down .
we wo n't be going back .
they are not friendly to bigger people .
the prime theater is ok if you do n't mind the extra price .
i can no longer come to my favorite theater now .
i rarely ever use another theater , until now .
i ca n't even leave it down .
no line , no rush to purchase tickets .
sad that i would have to do that .
no apologies or offers to correct their mistake .
such bad customer service at the framing desk .
simply put , they were a customer service disaster .
horrible customer service at this location .
dear michaels : i 'm tired of leaving empty handed !
unfortunately i have to agree with the majority of reviews for this particular location .
she was acting so inappropriate it was insane !
terrible terrible place !
andrew is lucky for these ladies because he by myself , turns customers away .
boring .
this might be the worst food i have ever eaten .
to put it nicely , the salad just plain sucked .
tonight was the final straw so to speak , we will not return .
so we had to wait another couple minutes for our drinks ( water . )
i said no , and she said it would be out soon .
w walked in and the atmosphere seemed decent too .
i really want this place to be good , but it just was not .
i was disappointed .
my husband got the wood grilled blackened halibut , and it was tiny .
it was alright , not good not awful , and overpriced for the size .
the shrimp skewer was overcooked .
they were dry and had very little flavor .
by the time it arrived everyone else was done their meal .
my daughter had the chicken tenders and did n't like them either .
the breading was very heavy and over done .
in all , skip it .
red lobster would probably have been better and cheaper too .
very disappointed and we wo n't be back !
to be honest , i wish i would have read the reviews online .
no waiting on a saturday night should be a clue .
we ignored them , but probably should have listened .
she started off with a bad attitude that was quickly going to get worse .
seating was very quick ; they are n't crowded at lunch .
`` you ca n't have a coleslaw because it comes with a vegetable . ''
after a _num_ minute wait the salad & bread were served .
then within _num_ minutes my main dish was brought out .
there is no coleslaw .
ca n't a girl get a coleslaw around here ?
the reply was '' oh , yes , another vegetable . ''
it took another _num_ minutes to get my coleslaw .
they comped the trout but still not sure i would go back .
would not recommend this place to anyone seeking good seafood .
my husband 's steak and prawns were weak .
the steak was not sirloin quality and the shrimp smelled and tasted badly .
my snow crab legs were good , but the side veggies were not .
overall our only positives were the side salads .
our server was pleasant but very slow .
no , it 's a very clean and shiny break in the plastic .
completely ruined .
inspect your gear thoroughly before leaving the shop .
the pastry was stale and hard and lacked flavor .
on our previous visit i did n't get dirty looks , only the attitude .
very dirty and sticky everywhere but the employees were nice and fast .
too bad not one was at the restaurant !
nothing was wilted or sour .
the fruit was in good shape , too .
they offer baked sweet potatoes as well as baked potatoes .
i was right , i should have just turned around and leave the place .
their selection of soups was very poor , maybe _num_ total .
rolls or bread was pitiful .
nothing wrong with a little veggie feast every now and again .
can i not have a whole bread stick ?
the people in this store are incredibly rude .
this walgreens literally deserves zero stars .
first off in the pharmacy department there is zero customer service !
oh well then just do n't bother coming here .
officially switching over to another pharmacy .
sad thing is i 've been coming here for years and nothing has changed .
the customer service is so poor .
nope you 're made to feel like an inconvenience .
they did bring out pizza to satisfy a little bit of our hunger .
we were placed near the bar , and it was very loud .
our waitress was unfriendly and all business .
no personality at all .
the macaroni rosa was only slightly warm and lacked flavor .
i 've had pink sauces before and this was no where close to them .
it 's a noodle with ricotta cheese in it .
i took one bite and was done .
i thought , what the hell , i give it another shot .
yet another disappointment .
totally terrible service .
i recommend getting the chicken marsala though .
our bill : $ _num_ - for one dish and garlic bread !
it 's ridiculous !
second , the service was terrible .
_num_ minutes after we were seated , we finally had the chance to order .
third , the way the restaurant is laid out , it 's very loud .
now , this is not the restaurants fault , but these people were obnoxious .
and finally , the food is terrible .
i probably will not be back to this location ... ever again .
worst service ever .
they ended up charging my card almost _num_ months later !
what a waste of time and money .
their use of the word feast borders on deceptive advertising .
what a rip-off for $ _num_ !
our response instead will be to never visit one of their restaurants again .
this company should be out of business so something better could fill the space .
if we could rate zero stars we 'd have done so .
while the food was decent the service was horrible .
i 'm not sure i 'd ever go back .
dont waste your time , or money .
this place is mediocre at best .
i should n't have to ask for bread with oil and vinegar .
i should n't have to ask for refills .
the food is only ok .
very disappointing .
it seems so unsanitary .
i do n't need every drink and appetizer described to me .
i had the bruschetta and it was such a huge disappointment .
seriously gross .
again - gross .
it was positively dripping in pesto cream sauce .
really , really unpleasant .
overall a huge disappointment .
i will not go back there again .
the food is greasy and sits like a lump in your stomach .
downside , they use processed white wheat when they make the food .
talk about overpriced and not very good .
and we also sat there for a good long time with empty soda glasses .
i would never go back to this place .
chopped antipasto salad and it 's not chopped very well .
sorry ; wish it was more exciting .
cars get broken into all the time at the st paul buca .
we recently ate at buca in st paul near the airport .
ha food was good service horrible .
now i remember why i do n't come here .
do not get the veal marsala , way too sweet .
i went back here finally after _num_ years of staying away .
if that was the case , i would have .
portions are good , but good portions of crap is still crap .
not a very good take out experience .
would not suggest take out from buca .
one of the worst dining experiences i 've ever had .
i wo n't be back .
spaghetti sauce was watery and spaghetti was not al dente .
chicken parm was bland .
bread was stale .
love they take you to your seat through the kitchen .
the waiter brought our drinks and some house bread .
i have to say that the house bread was pretty lousy .
we had the chicken parmesan , which was good .
i would not recommend this restaurant to my family and friends .
spend your money elsewhere on a better italian food .
_num_ ) food quality is awful .
just downright nasty .
_num_ ) the decor of the store is horrendous .
worse than the food .
_num_ ) ick .
ridiculous !
_num_ ) .
dont spend your money in this chain .
very bland .
no exaggeration .
do n't waste your time here .
really disappointing .
just another chain with folks who really do n't want to come to work .
seriously do n't bother .
restaurant felt dirty and definitely lack luster .
weird sewer smell and dusty everywhere .
food was ok at best and service was pretty bad .
unfortunate because it used to be pretty good .
will not be back .
literally zero flavor !
Positive
all the pastas were overcooked and overpriced .
overall impression is overpriced , over cooked , under flavored .
there is no way i will be back !
family style dining not really my thing .
service was okay , overall disappointing .
the service was horrible and the food worse .
it took over _num_ minutes just for the staff to ask about drinks .
the baked ziti was overcooked and lacked flavor .
it tasted like nothing .
severely disappointed in this place .
the worst part of it was when we asked the waiter for the manager .
they do n't deserve the money i gave them in the first place .
that 's how bad the manager and the service was .
then are entrees came in which was much smaller than i thought .
this place used to be good _num_ yrs ago but no more .
food is so bland that couldnt finish eating it .
service was not good either .
my husband and i were very disappointed !
i would not bring my children to a place like this .
the $ _num_ broccoli was practically raw ... too crunchy and not very good .
the fettuccine alfredo was the worst .
noodles over cooked and flavorless .
the prosciutto chicken was delicious , but the portion was small for $ _num_ .
service was marginal as well .
all in all ... i could n't wait to get out of there .
we spent over $ _num_ for an all over bad experience .
i will never visit a buca again .
server was friendly but the place was overly priced .
_num_ plus tax .
sorry but will not be returning .
been there _num_ times in the last _num_ months and wont go there again !
terrible service , ok food , and pathetic presentation .
i 'll never forget how gross it was and i 'll never go again .
ok food , poor service and by poor , mean slow .
also , the night we went , the place ran out of ice ?
brutal .
just came here for mothers day pickup for catering .
they asked me if i could wait _num_ minutes while they fixed the order .
i am going to cook burgers .
forget these clowns on a holiday .
it is a sure fire disaster .
the food was poor quality with a lack of options for variety .
gross !
this place is dirty and the food was horrible .
then came the ravioli which was watery with some canned tomatoes on top .
they probably would n't pass a health department inspection .
what a disaster .
the waiter brought out dinner plates which i passed out .
the pasta and chicken dishes were bland and tasteless .
the only good part of the meal was the salad and garlic bread .
for this experience we paid $ _num_ plus $ _num_ tip .
not digging that .
gross .
it is processed crap .
plus the alfredo sauce was laughable .
however , if you ever need to go order , pass it up .
tonight , we opted for take out as we had a sick child .
it was in a small catering tin and was probably 1/3 full of food .
very , very disappointed .
there just seemed to be a lack of communication all around .
i would absolutely , _num_ % not recommend this restaurant for private parties .
incredibly horrible service .
very disappointed .
they appreciate the customers they get , as should every restaurant .
it was awful .
their desserts are just stupid large .
friendly wait staff .
the chicken parm is inconsistent from visit to visit .
if the occasion called for it , i 'd come back .
but the service side of the scale is nearly empty .
it was finally time to leave , but buca would n't hear of it .
horrible `` food '' !
do not eat here ... go to the supermarket and buy better frozen cheaper .
took one bite and knew instantly it was frozen .
immediately left after short conversation with the manager who was surprisingly nice .
the server told us the balance on the gift card was zero .
it 's not very clean or organized .
would like to see them make it a little more user friendly .
most petsmart 's are the same unfortunately .
rude employees here .
oh ok ... so that makes it ok then i guess .
she came back stating the turtle was indeed turning himself over .
apparently she was upset that we cared too much for a turtle .
shame shame shame .
took our _num_ 1/2 yr old lab here for doggie day care .
this particular petsmart need to do a better job at training their employees .
hopefully someone from petsmart corporate reads this review and fixes this problem .
im sure they are losing customers just because of this one person .
she is almost _num_ yr old .
so that visit was so-so .
now _num_ months later i made sure i scheduled with someone else .
wo n't be back - they need to charge way less for inexperienced groomers .
so disappointed .
there should be for groomers as well .
they tried to up sell me like a dam car dealership .
do not recommend .
banfield costumer service is terrible .
no care or compassion at all .
i 'm completely disgusted with the poor customer service we received .
never dealing with petsmart again .
they 've really gone downhill in recent years .
no more .
the _num_ was only $ _num_ more .
by the way , i bought over $ _num_ worth of filter replacement products .
was petsmart taken over by new ownership ?
did petsmart forget they have competition ?
i suggest going to a competitor or buying online for your pet supplies .
petsmart no longer deserves to have customers with their new attitude .
so , that 's why i ca n't rate this place very well .
really ?
mine was way over cooked and the sides were all lackluster .
apparently they have vegetables but i would n't call them healthy .
i asked instead if i could have fresh green beans cooked by themselves .
my waitress said no .
totally ridiculous .
i will not be back .
the restaurants are always crowded and very loud .
they are always fall of the bone tender .
aside from that , we are unimpressed with everything else .
also , their wait is never bad .
ps : if you hate kids , do not come here .
last night for dinner my texas t-bone was under cooked and tough .
returned and was brought another t-bone under cooked and tough .
half rack of ribs were old and dry , sirloin overcooked .
server great , noise , food sucked , wo n't be back .
wish i had my $ _num_ back .
oh , get rid of the cinnamon butter .
i was not impressed with this place although i should have been .
the big problem were the ribs for me .
they were dry , and i mean bone dry which is no good .
not the worst but i have definitely seen better .
the meal was good , but the service was lousy .
not impressed .
although , the group selected afterwards were seated promptly .
i ordered the _num_ oz ribeye and honestly , i could have selected better .
the vegetable serving was completely overcooked .
this is my 3rd bad experience at this location .
they refused to give us another coupon for the remaining amount .
idiots cant cook a steak to save their lives .
idiots !
i was here on monday night for my moms birthday dinner .
it looked like it might have been dropped .
this is my 3rd bad experience at this location .
they refused to give us another coupon for the remaining amount .
not vegan friendly .
a big no no on restaurant nightmares .
_num_ .
_num_ .
they would not seat my girlfriend until i arrived .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
salad had too much dressing on it .
my prime rib was just ok .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
if you have a party larger than _num_ , do not go here .
worst customer service by a manager !
does n't value paying customers !
ps reading their facebook comments , others experienced the same as we did .
poor management !
horrible food .
tonight was one of those nights .
ate it all , then came the entree .
all i asked for was sour cream and butter on the potato .
again , it was me having a little food with my salt .
no one got their steaks cooked correctly .
she sent gets back .
what she got back looked like it might have been thrown in the microwave .
it was n't gone long enough to have been grilled longer .
this restaurant must have stock in blood pressure meds .
sorry , texas roadhouse .
you 'd already lost most of my family and friends .
cancelled and went somewhere else that could accommodate the customers needs .
no free food , no nothing .
horrible customer service .
the hostess asked how many people we reply _num_ adults _num_ children .
i was told that there was nothing they could do .
needless to say we went somewhere else .
customer service should be everything to the texas roadhouse but unfortunately it 's not .
i came here on a wednesday night with a friend .
the appetizers took _num_ minutes to get to us .
if it was super busy i would have understand .
after about _num_ minutes we started looking around trying to locate him .
he was standing at the bar watching a baseball game .
when they arrived , the rib 's were good , chicken was cooked nicely .
green beans were my side and they were stone cold .
i was beyond annoyed and just all around fed up .
i will not be coming back to texas roadhouse .
i drove across town to eat here after reading the mostly positive reviews .
if i 'd know , i would have just had water .
the bartender immediately brought me a basket of their rolls with cinnamon butter .
the green beans i simply did n't like .
they were also too salty to eat .
it was just salty corn in salty oily liquid .
of my entire meal , only my steak and sauted mushrooms were edible .
it 's too long a drive from my home to go back again .
i would not recommend the texas roadhouse to friends .
customer service is lacking .
the waitress took our empty basket and did n't come back with more .
when she brought them , they were cold again .
the service last night was very disappointing .
one should n't have to put up with a snooty hostess and bad service .
had the prime rib with sauteed mushrooms and steamed vegetables .
the sauted mushrooms were burnt and so was the 2nd batch .
i ate _num_ piece of carrot and the broccoli was literally inedible .
that would require me to come back to eat at your restaurant .
i ended up cleaning with a wet napkin .
the mashed potatoes were cold also .
the butter corn was luke warm .
not good .
it did n't work out that way however .
they never get the cook on my wife 's steak right .
our waiter had the personality of a cardboard box .
save yourself the frustration and hassle .
skip the dancing and country atmosphere and get your food cooked to order elsewhere .
it 's after _num_ , dang .
shame on you and your poor customer service .
but never , ever , ever give them your credit card for a membership .
next month rolls around and was charged another expired card fee .
no call no credit !
leaving this month to poor service .
horrible service , horrible spray tan both times i went .
customer service from courtney and amanda are horrible .
i could hear courtney laughing and they covered the phone .
they ca n't refund money at the local stores only corporate can do that .
as for the food , it was mediocre at best .
however , the meal as a whole was not even close to great .
in other words most of the food was cold .
any way dont waste your time here there is better across the street .
i wish i could get that meal back .
it was too packed , too dirty , and too greasy .
we got there and the place did n't even smell right .
it looked like an old run down hometown buffet .
there were tons of empty trays and theyre food looked very questionable .
they are stealing your money !
how are placing like this allowed to be open ?
will never return .
_num_ gals went there for a birthday party .
i wished someone would have searched this site for comments .
as others have said , it was gross from the minute we walked in .
almost every chair was ripped and torn .
the cold dishes was about _num_ '' off the ice .
hot foods were warm .
i wonder why the health dept has n't made a visit .
the whole place needs to be redone and deep cleaned from top to bottom !
every previous time was fantastic but this was just sad .
this store 's manager needs to get there staff in check asap .
then they gave us coupons to come back and sit for free next time .
does n't make sense in my book !
totally agree with the other reviewers about einstein 's being overpriced .
i so want to like this place .
thank god , it was n't busy because the service was so slow .
bagels were stale and blah as usual .
i hate coming here and i only come here to satisfy my kids .
this store also does n't deliver the bagels to your table .
pick one of those places and buy yourself some bagels .
just do n't come here , they do n't deserve you .
the service will be horrible .
when you get home , your order will be wrong .
you have been warned .
customer service is nonexistent here .
employees are not friendly at all .
second visit w/ my family of _num_ .
not a difficult order and not a busy time .
there were _num_ kinds there today , if that .
the customer service sucks even more than the selection .
she mentioned that she even complained to a regional manager .
if you like einstein 's bagels , do not go to this store .
the employees are rude , inconsiderate and could care less what you think .
if i could give this einstein bagel _num_ stars i would .
they could do no wrong in my eyes .
now i am terrified that more stores exist out there like this one .
the bathrooms were dirty , it was dead inside and i know why now .
if you want to have a bagel do n't go here .
it looked like they were all forced to be there and hated their lives .
go to your local grocery store and buy your own dozen .
avoid !
if possible , i would have rated no stars .
nasty bathrooms .
it feels as if we just walked into someone 's house without being invited .
a third party booked this room for me for _num_ nights .
my husband and i stayed at this motel for the last three nights .
the room we were then given , had a horrible smell !
i will never stay in a super _num_ motel again !
this was the most disappointing trip we have ever had !
if you appreciate the value of your money do not stay here !
are you kidding me ?
spend a little more money and stay somewhere else .
this place is gross , and smelly .
originally booked a room for _num_ nights here because they were pet friendly .
this place is disgusting to say the least !
i was worried about leaving my dog alone in the room let alone myself .
the bathroom clearly had not been cleaned .
nasty .
gross .
however , the beds were comfy .
he listened , looked at all photos .
no stars should be given !
it 's disgusting !
we had to leave _num_ hours after checking in !
i 'm not a fan of buffets .
so , why did i go here ?
wrong !
mmmmmm , chicken strips .
wrong again .
not good .
went with the lowest expectations and was n't disappointed .
not a fan of buffets or of fried foods or fatty foods .
the clam chowder was ok .
no alcohol here .
the hot fudge dispenser at the desert bar was empty .
this place does n't have much to choose from .
waitresses take too long to clean up dirty tables .
beverage area was always dirty .
the steamed fish was dry and smelled bad ; like the fish was old .
and no beef selection .
it just was not a good dining experience .
this location has too many tables and not enough buffet .
i counted _num_ counters including the drink station .
freakin ' hibachi grill has way more selection .
no chicken enchiladas here .
they had a tub of chicken tortilla soup but absolutely no soup bowls .
not good .
they are n't next to the right food .
hubby said the pizza was n't good .
my chocolate cake was very stale .
we got some food sat down and ate .
we were not thrilled .
the food was dry and cold .
so we went back and looked there but was nothing that we wanted .
more food was out and it was better .
we both ended up getting very sick from eating there .
i would not recommend going there .
very disappointed we all felt very ill after leaving .
disappointed .
as we got closer , we discovered it was cheesy mac and cheese .
my husband took one bite and it was bloody .
sorry to the people who saw me get sick outside the restaurant .
seriously gross food .
the food smells bad and looks even worse .
even my boys who all love food barely ate .
so disappointing for how much we paid !
they were out , was going to take about a half hour .
threw was no white meat fried or baked chicken .
it 's like they did n't know how to manage with a full house .
the turkey was not worth the wait .
the middle section by the soda machines had _num_ dirty tables .
not the best but wanted breakfast and had a coupon for the family .
unfortunately , they may never be able to return .
i was appalled at the language and behavior that was allowed in the arena .
-the maze is gigantic .
very gross !
no one wants to be touching another persons chewing gum while playing .
this facility does cost more than other competitors in the area .
check prices before you go and see what other facilities are offering .
not cool !
the laser tag itself was pretty decent but everything else wasnt great .
the arcade is small and the food is terrible .
which is not what was said .
i will not be going back .
they are not the only game in town anymore .
honestly , do n't waste your money and go to laser quest .
my _num_ minutes turned into closer to _num_ .
i finished the soup and salad , yet the server was not around .
the empty plates and drink cups sat there for nearly _num_ minutes .
the one redeeming factor was that it was n't karaoke night .
that usually is a horrible experience .
this is the second applebee 's that i tried in the last year .
they were bad and hard .
and my chicken was burnt and dry and overcooked .
sadly , we were quite disappointed .
quite empty , which we thought was good as we figured service would rock !
not so .
all of ours were cold .
finally , all of us except my husband left .
very poor service .
waitress seemed out of it and did n't care at all .
it was n't even a crowded night .
came here twice , service sucked both times ... do n't recommend this location .
needless to say , we will not be back for a while .
nothing there that would keep us coming back like before .
the waitress was bad and took _num_ minutes between refills .
applebee 's is a good place to eat , but skip this location .
i 'll drive another _num_ miles out of the way to avoid this one .
ate at the bar on a sunday after work .
no discount .
the manager just did n't seem to care about anything .
i wo n't rush back .
service was mediocre .
i was not happy .
she gave me my limeade free of charge .
i wo n't be going back to this location again .
i waited _num_ minutes before going inside and finding out my order was ready .
thinking back i do remember having a problem at this location about _num_ yrs .
i guess they have n't improved much in those years .
waited _num_ mins for drinks .
he did this literally _num_ times .
tonight was definitely not their night .
i just told the kids , they are having a bad night lets go .
bathrooms are a mess .
service was terrible and slow .
the stereo was way too loud for a family type atmosphere .
service very slow !
they waited at least _num_ to get their orders and drinks taken .
another _num_ minutes to get their drinks !
terrible service .
terrible meal .
our sandwiches were very dry like they used stale bread .
the place was almost empty .
dont eat here i would give them _num_ if i could !
place is disgusting .
staff at bar falling over and being obnoxious while in uniform .
drinks were terrible .
none of the food looked very fresh and it was pretty greasy .
sadly , the worst part was the condition of the restaurant .
do not recommend this restaurant .
had to wait well over _num_ minutes for food and then it was cold .
it 's gone downhill since then .
i had the teriyaki chicken , which was pretty good and very flavorful .
he yelled at the customer and was extremely disrespectful .
cream cheese sushi = not cool .
the worst !
did not get what we ordered .
i do not recommend to anyone .
food is bland and just nothing to get excited about .
the bread seemed old and tasted stale .
finally their fries were a disappointment .
my husband and i went there for our first time today .
what a mistake .
the inside trash was overflowing .
too late .
the food though , is not so fantastic .
both tasted deep fried , which is totally weird .
service was horrible !
my order was n't complete , i had to ask for my toast .
it was n't great , but it was n't horrible .
for the cost , i felt cheated .
honestly , i will not go here again .
i order bacon & eggs , wife got the _num_ $ omelet .
my biggest beef the music was ridiculously loud !
that was the only good thing about this place .
they were dry , over done and cold .
the batter was over beaten so they were tough and chewy .
i ordered the bagel breakfast , which sounded great , but beware !
first , no fresh fish menu .
so i ordered uni , hamachi , smoked sake ( i know .
pretty fishy , but that is to be expected .
the cooked dishes were forgettable , but not terrible .
i 've never been so disappointed in a $ _num_ check .
ok ; here is my input .
still an `` average '' place for sushi and japanese food .
the prices are slightly on the high side , but not outrageous .
every watch that chef on iron chef ?
the first time i had the ramen and it was n't very good .
i 'm no sushi expert , but i was n't terribly impressed .
it was a huge disappointment .
_num_ nigiri sushi orders ( _num_ pieces each ) _num_ rolls .
at the time it was the highest average rating for sushi in mesa .
we ordered the tuna , yellowtail , tempura , and salmon sushi rolls .
let 's just say the yellowtail almost made both of us sick .
however , all where average to poor .
me and probably my companion will never go back again .
one of the servers barely spoke any english .
the uni was actually pretty good but really was not impressed with the tempura .
the hamachi was served with skin on it which i really do not like .
this is not good sushi , do not waste your time or money .
none of us ordered sushi .
my wife was surprised to find the ramen noodles to be spicy .
no one was complementary about their meal .
came here due to the good reviews but i was disappointed .
the sushi did not taste very good .
not very professional .
there was not one thing that would make me want to return .
i usually go by yelp recommendations for new places to eat .
it was only about a few tables busy .
poor guy was so tired of waiting .
she quickly said sorry but not very sincerely .
will not go back .
welcoming atmosphere but did n't enjoy the sushi here that much !
i 'd rather go to tempura sushi bar instead .
i have eat here many times before , the sushi is very low priced .
i will never go their again !
this place sucks will not suggest to anyone !
food was good but waiting over an hour was ridiculous .
only _num_ tables .
wo n't be going back .
everything else i 've eaten recently is stuff i 've had before .
the menu looked like it had several great options .
the vegas roll was drenched in soy sauce .
i was very disappointed .
her noodles were n't bad but my curry was pretty bland .
nothing special .
terrible , horrible , awful !
save your nails and do not make a visit here .
went in for a simple manicure and they damaged my nails beyond repair .
within _num_ days two of my nails snapped and broke into the nail bed .
do not take your nails to nail _num_ be !
my apartment was clean and left in rent able condition when i left .
the staff seems friendly , but are very slow to help with concerns .
which was not discussed at my lease signing .
they turned off my water without notice .
do n't move in !
it does n't make me feel the pampering that i deserve .
no one said hello or offered to help us .
i do n't like tomatoes .
the replacement burrito tastes slightly better than the first but not by much .
ugh f me and my burrito cravings .
my burrito was ok.
neither one was anything special .
the salsa bar was a mess .
tables were a mess .
i wo n't be going back .
needless to say , we asked for our money back and left .
the food is fresh and edible , but very forgettable .
a veggie burrito for example is _num_ calories .
i will not be returning .
it was just okay , but not great .
the person in the bath room was a hispanic baja fresh worker .
he then left and we went in '' it was disgusting .
never eating there again after this ... gross !
she then said , she would have to figure it out .
wrote all of this with no call , she must still be on hold .
they may be conveniently located but there is nothing else convenient about chase .
i just assumed that there must be more to the story .
in all my years , i 'd not experienced it .
i like trader joe 's , just not a big fan of this location .
could this place be anymore crowded ?
even then there is no order to checking out .
bad check out experiences every time i come here .
but today was exceptionally bad .
bad business !
bad business !
bad business !
their excuse was that first estimate was only good for _num_ hours .
i 'm out another office visit fee only for them to change the estimate .
anyone else ripped off by them ?
do not give them any of your money !
next time i will take my new dog elsewhere .
very disappointing one person does n't know what the other one is doing !
very unorganized establishment .
ill never take my dog to this location again !
this place is ridiculous .
i waited for _num_ minutes before walking out .
we sat in the bar ( i like to avoid screaming children ) .
it took over _num_ minutes for our salads to arrive !
the server never checked on us and i had to go find him .
the tomatoes were so hard and pink they were borderline inedible .
they were topped with one basil leaf and half of a mini mozzarella ball .
it sucked .
if you go , have the bread and leave !
not good when the wife is looking for drinks .
when we arrived , the place was mostly empty .
very disappointing , bland food , burnt pizza crust .
will not go again , the end of a family tradition .
just blah in my opinion ... .
tonight we dined on pasta and ass .
i just do n't have much faith in italian chains in general .
i went here the other night and it was a fairly not awesome experience .
the food was completely bland .
my pasta came burnt ( crispy noodles ! )
skip this place for sure !
this was n't a horrible dining experience .
probably closer to a _num_ star .
but it certainly was n't fantastic .
it just was n't great .
restaurant was almost empty you would think the service would be better .
never saw the manager to check on us .
walked in at _num_ on a friday night .
i signed up for yelp just to share this ridiculous experience .
party of _num_ .
had to wait _num_ minutes anyway .
looks good from the outside , but inside ... service ... not good !
we all stated , `` gross '' at the same time .
nothing at all .
do n't want you to see what you are actually getting i guess .
the pesto bean bruschetta lacked flavor ( where was the pesto ?
and should have been served warm .
the stuffed mushrooms were just boring .
hubby got the trio and did n't even bring the spaghetti home .
he said it was terrible .
was told there was a _num_ minute wait .
when i complained , she said they had a reservation .
then she said there were _num_ more parties before us .
i was pissed .
there was no apology .
and no one over the age of _num_ to complain too .
too bad they had no flavor .
it was such a shame .
f -- - me , i still have $ _num_ to spend .
the sale is scheduled to close mid _num_ .
not sure if any of the phoenix locations are company owned or not .
well tonight was not a good experience .
in fact , it sucked .
my wife usually gets cold so we thought that would be a great .
after taking our drink orders she just walked away .
once again , she offered no specials or recommendations .
we looked around and other patrons had bread , yet we did not .
what a disappointment !
their standards have fallen considerably .
first of all the place looks somewhat dingy .
our silverware was dirty as was the wall next to our booth .
it was totally bland .
we could n't get out of there fast enough .
when we left the place was virtually empty .
went here tonight for my sister 's birthday per her request .
drinks were never refilled .
no water was ever refilled .
our waiter said she could choose one so she chose the chocolate cake .
it took _num_ minutes for the dessert to come out .
service is poor and food quality is just okay .
went here to eat tonight for dinner .
the olive oil without our bread was the first red flag .
more than _num_ minutes later possibly more our bread came .
our drinks arrived _num_ minutes after that .
the people sitting at the actual bar were getting better service !
we ordered a couple of appetizers and they were horrible .
now , this crap is garbage .
my wife had some rigatoni stuff and it was terrible .
i asked the server what the hell is going on .
they do n't even wear ties anymore and they wear jeans !
this one is garbage and their food sucks .
if you do n't believe me , then go there yourself .
the room was about 1/3 full and we were all being crammed together .
Positive
i also wish i could give this dump a negative _num_ stars .
first clue , very slow service .
apps were n't bad .
meatballs in a way hot sauce and something that looked worse than it tasted .
entrees were at best terrible .
my side of spaghetti was cold .
not just not hot or warm , cold .
my wife ordered some shrimp pasta dish , not alfredo .
she told me shrimp was tough and had me try it .
it was like eating wet cardboard .
there was a total of _num_ tables with other diners .
once seated our server stopped by very quickly to get drink orders and apps .
we even joked that it was because someone ordered lasagna .
the parmesan crusted chicken salad .
now , you might be thinking , `` damn , little harsh bro ! ''
that is just inexcusable .
piss poor .
not a chance .
after our order was taken everything was terrible .
tables throughout were left dirty and disgusting .
let me stress i will never be back .
this was rude and ridiculous .
i am done with macaroni grill , as long as everyone in our party .
thanks for nothing and for charging us .
they 're doing nothing but losing money .
the fact that they have an opera trained singer on staff .
we were seated immediately , and the waitress was friendly .
she seemed very confused about what was on draft when we inquired .
it was a sea of black pepper and a few sprinkles of olive oil .
my food was ok with pasta that was a little too rubbery in texture .
there are probably lots of better italian restaurants in the area that are better .
cold food and indifferent service .
not a fan of panda express .
portion size very little at this panda .
i really do n't have time to teach english while placing my order .
they seem to run out of the popular items a lot .
panda express , i wish i could quit you !
craving chinese , so we went back to this location today .
same thing happened the last time i was here .
do not eat at this location .
this has been the third time i have been here with the same issues .
go away this is all we have .
i went there for dinner and the service and food was terrible .
the sauce was watered down and was more rice than the chicken .
too many options in this area .
let me take a bite ... ... is that ?
waiter : `` well thats our sauce .
me : `` no .
it isnt just tomato .
too bad .
excuse me ?
no one asked you your opinion about my dogs training collar .
i used to refer this clinic , but no longer will .
i was n't planning on letting them trash the place .
the dr snapped at me asking why we even had dogs .
but the customer service is awful .
i will not be going back .
waste of time , but fine .
is this some sort of sick joke ?
horrible place !
if they did care they would n't be so rough and hurt them !
she was so rude !
also the guy at the front desk is somewhat rude .
the price i 'm paying is n't that great either .
the only good thing is the location is close to me .
if i would have to do it again i would go to another location .
my experience here has been horrible .
no big deal .
i have adopted a few dogs before .
i was a little irritated at this point .
she yelled at my daughter to get away from the dog .
she responded with , `` i do n't care what she is doing .
that 's not the issue .
my husband and i usually stop at this chilis when we do go .
he walked away relatively quickly but he too was very friendly .
took ten minutes to be greeted by wait staff .
dined on a tuesday night at 5:30 restaurant was dead .
would n't be surprised if this one closed soon .
avoid this location at all costs .
just back from the worst lunch experience i have ever had .
plenty of available tables but none the less , was asked to sit there .
when the drinks arrived , we ordered from the menu .
odd , i thought this was grilled shrimp .
so , i bit into another one and yep , cold .
( its _num_ degrees outside today . )
no thank you .
i left a _num_ tip and we left .
the phone call did not go well .
( grilled chipotle shrimp salad ? )
again ... never going to this place again .
if jessica was our actual server then the rating would have been better .
not great , but not bad .
so i sent an email .
another week passed and a second email has gone ignored .
my next step is to contact chili 's corporate offices .
that is the _num_ stars for tonight .
not anymore .
my boyfriend & i are regulars at all chilis locations .
every time we go to this location , the service is horrible .
they take _num_ mins to greet us after were sat , if that .
anyway , the food is always delish , compliments to the chef .
usually , we have no problems , but tonight it was exceptionally bad .
there was none .
david ( bartender ) and his partner were extremely rude .
gross !
overall , completely terrible .
it was a tuesday night , practically empty .
all around a disappointing visit .
but today our service was beyond horrible .
never again !
do not eat here .
very poor service .
our waiter was n't attentive at all .
the original baby back ribs were very dry & hardly any meat on them .
ordered dinner for _num_ adults and _num_ child .
cup of soup was barely warm ... .
this is not a well run location .
_num_ star .
only because i ca n't give it _num_ stars .
sat for _num_ minutes , nobody greeted us .
and our service was slow .
very disappointed in chilis .
we paid $ _num_ for a cake with shit berries .
this entire meal was so not worth it .
i ordered catering twice this week at this location .
yesterday , i ordered catering again ( same exact order as before ) .
when i arrived , the food was not ready and nothing was bagged up .
this location was messy , unorganized and unapologetic .
and the food sucked !
i could n't get a good meal to save my life that day .
i have been to other locations twice before and each experience was okay .
we went and the service was slow and our food was wrong .
i wo n't go back .
this restaurant closed down about a year ( or more ) ago .
i stood around for awhile .
so i ended up buying a more expensive model .
when i got to the register apparently it was not working .
does n't office max deal in computers ?
anyway , it took about _num_ min to make my purchase .
the store was clean but the staff was way less then stellar .
they rang me up took the card and gave me the discount no problem .
this store is not organized well .
she said they probably were and kept ringing me up .
she said oh yeah , what do you want me to check .
complete waste of time .
i just know i 'm not shopping there again .
took over an hour to get printed , sat there waiting patiently .
manager on the phone could only say i 'm sorry that it happened .
was there the night of may _num_ .
staff were less than helpful , in fact they were n't helpful at all .
poor customer service was an understatement for this store .
the store was a ghost town but yet no representative even acknowledged my existence .
the barista was so rude , like , unbelievably rude .
again , with a very rude tone .
i 've never been treated this way at a starbucks .
i pity every customer that has to suffer their poor attitudes .
she did n't even apologized .
worst coffee and service ever .
i 'm running out of starbucks to go to .
not that impressed .
wo n't be back .
they wanted to charge me additional because my vehicle was `` over sized '' .
this business just lost my business .
not even getting started on the bad job they did with cleaning my car .
third strike and they 're out .
not _num_ minutes later i saw my car in line to be washed .
why would i bring it here to be done if it was clean already ?
ugh .
so frustrating .
hey , it 's not his fault .
please avoid this place .
mean employees that were literally yelling at drivers .
very disappointed in wash results .
i 've tried _num_ of their locations and had bad service at each .
worst car wash i 've ever had !
i did n't notice til today that the milk was still there !
paid top dollar for shampoo full interior and wax .
will never use them again , this was second time .
i do n't know how they have stayed in business this long .
never had such horrible service anywhere .
needless to say , we will not be returning to this car wash .
gave this place another shot today and i regret it .
i was charged $ _num_ for the oil change .
that 's not what i asked for .
the `` manager '' was not professional and i will not be going back .
did n't touch the inside of the windshield until i pointed it out .
left the broken piece just sitting there .
rude ass people !
like who the fuck cares i came here to wash my car .
it 's not closed you just put two cones on the entrance .
i would give them no star if i could 've !
i told him i had just received a monthly pass , a splash pass .
this is the worst car wash i 've ever been to !
do not go to this car wash , full circle !
this car wash includes the interior and exterior to be cleaned .
he said his manager , tony , was n't in today .
he never gave me my money back either !
never offered me a car wash in the future .
disappointed !
they tried hard sale upgrades from the jump .
and they backed off .
he gave me some tips cuz he knows cars and owns a dealership .
do n't u wipe the interior ?
oil change guys , not so much !
car is clean outside however the interior not so great .
did a terrible job , left cleaning gear in the truck .
first visit did not clean bugs off vehicle and did damage to roof .
lost the chance at a good new customer with four cars .
needless to say i will not return and i would not recommend this business .
worst so called wash ever !
outside not bad , but the inside looks like they did nothing .
no call that it was finished .
they did a terrible job !
i 've had $ _num_ car washes that were cleaned better .
they ripped us off .
if you 're thinking of getting a car wash here , do n't .
you had the car for _num_ hours .
not even worth my time or money .
do not recommend .
disappointed .
poor service and poor wash job .
they do a better job and they dont talk back .
i would not recommend this credit union to any one .
my husband and i have had nothing but problems and rude customer service .
i was really disappointed by the whole meal , from start to finish .
will not be back .
every time i go to this place it gets worse and worse .
i ordered oven roasted herb chicken .
not as big as you 'd think , especially for the price .
it 's very dark , too dark for my taste .
unfortunately , we felt ignored by the staff .
this was not our first visit but it was our last .
$ _num_ for a small piece of dry meat and a baked potato ?
overall disappointing .
it took our server _num_ minutes to tell us .
i ordered the ribeye special .
and it was crap .
with no wine .
i stopped at mcdonalds on the way back to my hotel .
this place sucks .
this place sucks ... service is the worst ever !
i do n't know what has happened but this place has gone downhill .
the service that was once so amazing , sucked .
thing is , the servers make the salads themselves so she clearly just forgot .
my chicken sandwich , which is normally delicious , had very little flavor .
it had no flavor , when in the past , it 's been delicious .
ridiculous .
this restaurant that was once so great is now crap .
i will not be going back .
poor service .
this location his location is not up to the charleston 's standards .
should n't he be worried ?
draft beers were n't even cold .
ugh .
not impressed one bit .
they seem to be accommodating to the handicapped though .
not so anymore .
$ _num_ prime rib that you could hardly cut with a knife .
too bad .
did n't want to complain when every one else was real happy .
we had dinner here last night and were disappointed .
he did not return with a cloth or anything .
no wait at all at charleston 's , and with good reason .
the food is very overpriced especially when you consider portion size .
texas roadhouse beats the pants off of this place hands down .
she finally got her grilled cheese sandwich another _num_ minutes later .
worst experience ever !
did not even eat left ruining our night .
eat at your risk , dirty kitchen and dining room .
find another place to get your wings .
the sauces could not be split on all the orders which is a bummer .
it was n't horrible but it was strange .
i ca n't quite place what the smell is with them .
some of the wings were crispy and some were not so crispy .
very disappointed !
i called up like i usually do and put my order in .
they got _num_ pizzas wrong .
we went back to complain and got attitude from them and no apologies .
it requires patience .
hot and ready pizza ?
not at this location .
calling ahead does n't help either .
my brother lives here and this place is a shit hole .
he has problems with the maintenance men here all the time .
does the term `` market rate '' appear anywhere in your lease ?
hell no !
oh , wait ... .
unless it 's late at night .
do n't walk , run from these apartments .
i lived there for one month and hardly made a mark in the place .
my apartment was not clean when i moved in !
i am a healthcare traveler and my company put me up in these apartments .
the place is a shit hole .
run down , everything is out dated .
save your money because these places are not worth it .
nobody picks up after there animals so watch where you step .
but anything that came from the office was garbage !
we left the apartment two months early because we got into a house .
we gave them the keys yesterday , excited that the fees would stop .
save yourself money and trouble , do n't use this company !
plus _num_ dogs !
it 's horrible !
this place is nothing more then a hotel _num_ !
would not recommend them to anyone .
perhaps if these people grow up , they 'll , um , grow up .
people in this part of town also can not read or count money .
people there are polite , and the customers have a brain .
so i ordered the tacos at $ _num_ each .
i ordered _num_ de pastor and _num_ of lengua .
i really did n't like the tacos .
i do n't know how this restaurant earned _num_ stars .
when we first walked in , it felt like we were in a sauna .
the food was not fresh as they advertised on their front glass window .
there was hair in my food and the employees were rude .
first time .
burnt meat on _num_ tacos and a burrito .
bad red sauce and the tortillas were dried and burnt .
my experience was very different .
the service was nothing exceptional .
ordered the cheeseburger and the chili cheese fries with onions .
but my breakfasts made at home kill over what we got .
for breakfast so how could we go wrong ?
the staff was as friendly as could be .
it was a sunday , people were chatting .
hot dog , was a standard hot dog on a fresh bun .
i could see the fat being squeezed out of it .
well , my wife had a hair in her shake sooo that is disgusting .
they gave us _num_ bucks back for the shake and apologized .
bacon cheeseburger , fries and coke .
it was the standard burger you eat in your neighbors yard at a bbq .
not even close , but their prices are close .
are the winners in taste , value and price .
_num_ guys is awesome but a royal rip off .
fries were lukewarm .
but a little below average .
burgers top bun was very hard .
wo n't come back .
my largest complaint is that i was charged $ _num_ for a milkshake here .
service was bad .
went back out and ate what we had ordered and it was alright .
did seem giant too me .
nothing special going on here .
will not be going back ever .
floors , tables , etc are dirty and gross .
burger was nothing special .
fries were ok but not hot enough .
just ate at this restaurant and i was extremely disappointed .
i read reviews that were good , and i should not have believed them !
i asked the waitress if the chili was homemade and she said no .
she told me i should have gone with the bacon cheeseburger .
fries were n't the fresh cut kind and the chocolate shake was bland .
gross .
not worth it .
would not recommend .
bad service and burgers are not that good .
$ _num_ no way !
way to much money for that !
most likely i will not be returning !
i never heard from gary and he never showed up that day .
very disappointed in the customer service i received .
at least talk trash about customers not in front of other customers .
it seems like common sense to me .
not a pleasant experience this saturday morning .
if there is a option , i would give them zero star .
this monday i found my car is dripping oil .
they said it cost over _num_ bucks to fix the pan .
no thank you .
i can not believe that .
no wait or cars ahead of me and they still took forever .
over _num_ mins for an oil change and an air filter change .
horrible .
first off , i know my way around a car .
i was told they would get me right in and look at it .
i 'm sorry , but wtf .
there 's no service .
maybe a return visit on a tuesday in july .
toppings are only done in 1/2 .
frustrating !
the pizza is not even worth eating , imo .
the beer and wine is cheap .
i have n't been here in _num_ + years ever since my last experience .
food was edible ... not good , not the worst .
i think most people are being very generous to say it 's ok .
very bad pizza .
to me , the only positive thing of the place is the organ music .
and then they cheated on the toppings too .
overall , the place has the ambience of a german beer hall during oktoberfest .
but the food is terrible .
i am thinking people are writing reviews for the atmosphere and not the food .
the food is not good .
it was n't bad but could have used more sauce .
why not just collect the full amount when you place an order .
it could be a little awkward .
ca n't believe we drive _num_ miles for this place .
i did n't know you could screw that up .
we came , we tried , we wo n't be doing it again !
i just returned from a meet up at the organ stop pizza .
the pizza was mediocre at best .
the room was crowded .
i really did n't enjoy it as much as i thought i would .
his entire arm was covered in american flag tattoos .
wait staff at the front counter were awful !
not kid friendly in menu choices @ drink counter .
only accepts cash or checks , does not take debit / credit cards .
pizza is below average & over priced .
the organ is the obvious highlight .
the pizza was n't bad .
cash only , pricey , leave it for the tourist !
let me just say this was not my thing .
crazy setup , you wait in a line and order your pizza .
( wow , possibly worst description ever .
i read other reviews , ignoring the food , but come on now .
it 's _num_ % about the food and the food sucked .
peter piper pizza has better food than this place .
there was no redeeming quality in anything we ordered .
not true .
it 's obvious the owners are strictly in business for the money .
i wo n't be back .
when i watch them play , i 'm totally in awe .
pizza is not so great , service is just ok , and cash only ?
plus the way you order is a mess .
the pizza was some weird and mixture of blah .
buying drinks by the pitcher is fine but it 's soda ... seriously ?
unfortunately , it 's not always enough .
the food is overpriced and very sub-par .
but again ... not worth it .
starving .
drove over to mesa and walked in to be instantly turned away .
so rude .
not allowed to wait in the building at all .
made no sense .
ugh .
queens pizza and the waitstaff was awesome .
wait in another line to order your drinks .
we went at _num_ on a week night and the place was packed .
this was our date night , and that 's really weird .
and from there , could n't see the organ at all .
tonight was our second and likely final visit to organ stop .
sad to have a musician get a power trip .
it was n't worth the noise and the people .
not going back , i think .
like a bad joke that sucks in _num_ year olds ) .
this management company is horrible .
wondering when the common areas in dobson place will be maintained .
dead plants are not being replaced .
on several occasions i have had to deal with this company , unfortunately .
no vote , just a letter that they have decided to not allow it .
if you are considering using this company , i would recommend using someone else .
i was in the area so i tried out royal cleaners .
went here for the first time because they had the _num_ mens shirt special .
will never take my dry cleaning back to this cleaner .
bad business if you want a customer to come back .
big mistake .
needed _num_ buttons on a shirt .
they told me that they might not have the same ones .
but they put _num_ different color buttons on the shirt .
there is no sense of customer service at all .
not expect bed bugs but i know nothing about the bug .
the clean up service outside is horrible !
the maintenance was nice but lazy .
the management is not up to par there 's always a lack of communication .
i 'm so disappointed i 've never been to an apartment like this !
this place is horrible !
biggest mistake ive ever made .
what is advertised on the web site is not what you get .
nothing in our apartment is updated .
photos i posted are only a small handful of everything i took pics of .
terrible customer service .
they were talking poorly of customers .
i do not recommend this store .
there is tolerable people there .
during these years i have not seen much improvement on customer service .
wo n't be going back .
seems like you would be more supportive of paying customers .
zero stars .
i was pissed .
now not one good item !
_num_ items should get you at least $ _num_ !
the store was n't even packed either !
i really would n't even give this place one star !
not anymore i am not sure who owns it now but what a shame !
they do n't even deserve _num_ star !
either way i 'm not returning !
i am so disappointed in the way they handled my accident .
the vet said it was likely from the cleaning fluids .
maybe she was having a bad day , but i was very unimpressed .
we left our _num_ dogs here june _num_ .
no problems .
again , june _num_ left our dogs there for _num_ days while on vacation .
we wait _num_ minutes after our appointment time to be brought back .
that did n't sit well with us .
i have never been so unhappy with a vet in all my life .
they would not let us hold her or help at all .
very disrespectful and rude .
i would never take this dog or any animal back to this office .
i would n't send my worst enemy there .
i then scheduled the appointment to save $ _num_ .
had i been that late they would have cancelled my appointment .
explained it for about _num_ seconds to my daughter .
i guess i 'm too old to understand and was out like a shot .
the front desk staff are very disorganized .
this is really too bad as the doctors and back office staff are good .
terrible terrible terrible .
if i could leave no stars , i would !
very rude , show no interest , and make you feel stupid !
i was in tears because of how disrespectful and awful this experience was .
i hate this place !
this company has to have the worst customer service in the world .
i left a terrible review .
the worst place i 've ever encountered in my life .
they had me come back in and had me fooled they made things right .
i refuse to give these people time of day again .
wish i could give less than _num_ star .
just pain terrible .
all they had to do was call me they have my number .
worst health care facility i have ever been to .
my new doctor told me that was probably caused by using the wrong lens .
caution to all food city shoppers at southern and mesa dr !
i 've always purchased ground beef from this location and never had problems .
i personally do n't recommend them due to my experience with them .
what a nightmare .
i have no heat until wednesday .
owner is not willing to do anything about it .
the job obviously still is n't complete _num_ months after the job was done .
i 'm very disappointed .
so now i know why my house has n't been rented in _num_ months .
that is _num_ months of mortgage payments down the drain .
bad experience .
i would give this _num_ stars if i could .
just fair warning if you plan to work with these guys .
however , not so much .
i would avoid this place at all costs .
i would warn you to avoid this shop and go to performance muffler instead .
i spoke too soon .
their shop was empty so i figured it would get done quickly .
he said it was a _num_ dollar job .
avoid at all costs .
imo , denise at todd 's needs a class in customer service .
her sense of urgency is very poor .
high price , takes two or more trips and would not recommend .
looking at other review sites , this is not the company i want .
they advertise a lot , but that does not mean much to me .
whatever your bag is , they can make it .
the 1st time i ate here .
my friends chicken strips tasted like sausage .
the strips were replaced with chicken tasting chicken .
they gave me guacamole in a small paper cup .
my friend noticed that i got the wrong size .
next time i will spend more money .
for better service at giant burger that is in the same mall .
worst service ever !
worse whataburger yet !
i will never ever return to this whataburger !
it was unacceptable .
the food is n't too bad for bar food .
that 's where it goes down hill .
the wait staff there favors the larger groups .
no apology and it took over a week to fix the error .
i have been sitting in this establishment for _num_ minutes .
and not to mention the _num_ fee with no description next to it .
he 's like there 's no fee .
lame fee people .
was a neighborhood stop for me but not no more .
two thumbs down .
wish i could give no stars .
ok , i stopped in with _num_ friends last night .
she was n't real friendly but that was n't a big deal .
anyway , she give me back $ _num_ in change .
needless to say , this is outrageous pricing and we will not be returning .
the food is so-so , nothing special , though fairly priced .
the rotation is too long to work it 's way back around .
made me feel sick to my stomach .
it 's definitely not for the younger scene .
if you 're looking to play darts , do n't waste your time .
the darts do n't stick and are broken .
pathetic .
they just take up room .
i 'm not being rude , or exaggerating my review in any way .
possibly the worst pizza and wings i have ever had !
this still does n't excuse them for selling crap .
the pizza was super thin with virtually no sauce or crust .
even the ingredients were terrible .
low quality bread cheese n pepperoni .
this place should be ashamed to serve the crap they do .
Negative
go to oregano 's instead .
so gross .
so , so gross .
do n't waste you 're time or your money .
awful wings , filthy tables .
pizza tastes like frozen ... burgers are nothing special .
overpriced mediocre food ... .
not great , but not bad .
friendly , but painfully slow .
i felt abandoned many times .
what should have been a _num_ hour visit , easily turned into _num_ .
in a word : depressing .
otherwise , we might as well have been sitting in an elementary school cafeteria .
absolutely awful food , terrible service , and a gross dirty restaurant .
have been there to eat _num_ times .
it is also dirty and the service can be very slow .
too many other good choices around town .
this is so not acceptable .
terrible all around .
boy was i wrong .
needless to say i will never return to this location .
management needs to understand this is not how you treat customers .
this place is gross !
i am shocked and disgusted !
first noticeable thing was the smell .
wings came out and could not believe how small they were .
service was slow .
the fish and chips actually took _num_ or _num_ minutes .
fries were a little soggy but fish good .
not helpful or smiley .
this is the worst you can do to a customer .
are you too lazy to walk them to a table ?
- place was disgusting .
no ambience , not hip at all .
- rude waiters , specially the guys that work here .
no smile , not friendly .
- our chicken strips came out burnt .
not worth it .
it was not the bartenders shift .
he was there sitting as a patron with friends .
we understand rules , but they should apply to everyone .
horrible just horrible .
first off , the wings we ordered were all too salty .
it really tasted like it was thrown in a bucket of salt !
i was so disappointed .
and then just transferred our call .
disgusting !
you can smell cigarette smoke while waiting to be seated .
everytime ive come to this native , it sucks .
the servers are never attentive , food is mediocre .
once had delicious juicy wings , now the worst wings i 've ever had .
tonight was an extreme disappointment !
they were tasteless , even with the flavors i choose .
i was not impressed at all and do not plan on returning .
only gave two stars because of his customer service .
the food was n't as flavorful as i remember it to be .
this location is pretty crappy .
it was n't until recently we were n't able to go as often .
oh my gosh going back seemed like the worst experience we have ever had .
looking at these reviews i can already see others having the same problem .
not impressed at all .
the food is not that food to wait that long .
this location was very dirty ( i.e .
the table was sticky , the floor had trash all over the place ) .
fries are cheap to make , what 's the issue ?
wo n't be back again , definitely picking a different location .
slow service mixed with the worst cheese possible on a pizza .
the table chairs are narrow and uncomfortable .
we walked in , were handed menus and told to seat ourselves .
the menu consists of extremely overpriced bar food that is just mediocre at best .
service was just o.k .
this establishment lacks the customer service i require as a result of sub-par management .
the food is too salty and greasy .
i would n't recommend this place .
last week was our first visit to native .
from there it went downhill very fast .
how rude and how ridiculous .
this has to be the worst native .
worst service .
they take forever to get your drinks and even longer to take your order .
had a pick up order , was told _num_ mins .
worst native i 've ever seen .
never going back .
avoid them at all costs !
i was just treated terribly by the owner of mesa frozen yogurt today !
i paid for it , left the place and threw it away !
the amount wasted would have been comparable to maybe _num_ samples .
she could care less that i was n't going to eat it .
drove out of our way to visit this establishment .
arrived to find chairs up on tables and doors locked .
not to mention the coffee was burnt !
not looking good !
me : um !
girl : why u want me to make it again ?
i am so disappointed .
it drives me crazy when things like this happen often .
this starbucks is somewhat busy but , at mid morning the rush is over .
do n't care for the service here .
not very friendly .
this is the worst starbucks place for internet .
it 's very , very slow .
i 've been here twice , and never again .
all the other starbucks i 've been to never had this issue .
someone is trying to save a few dollars each month i guess .
customer service was terrible .
worst starbucks i 've ever been to .
additionally , it did not have any coffee in it .
it was clear this barista was having nothing to do with that .
this place is terrible .
... no dice .
my next phone , i will buy online .
absolute worst service over phone .
trying another store instead .
never very helpful .
i contacted them after i walked out the store after speaking to a rep .
overall , i really question verizon in regard to quality and warranty .
think really hard and long before dealing with anything that says verizon .
horrible customer service .
extremely rude , unfriendly bunch they have over there .
unfortunately that was not what happened at the store .
what could be worse then the wait at the dmv ?
changing my phone plan was nothing less then torture .
they 've lied to me every time i 've been here .
what terrible customer service .
it was too long and made with cloth .
when i arrived , i was greeted with `` just a moment '' .
my daughter was a little bit busy getting married .
in addition she was rude .
we probably wo n't be back anytime soon .
boy was i wrong .
i was greeted kindly by the two ladies at night .
went here on a sunday night and the place was a bit crowded .
i could n't even finish it because it was greasy and salty .
i would n't order pizza or garlic bread again over there .
i would not come back here again if i ha a choice .
the pizza was not as good as other stores for sure !
i 've never had a bad experience at this location until now .
they are simply sub-par and lack any real good burger flavor .
unfortunately , the food is nothing to write home about .
it 's kind of sad , really .
the above being said , quality relative to price ... bad .
the same thing i always get and i was very disappointed .
there were some burnt areas and boy could i taste it .
it completely ruined the burger .
nothing could cover up that horrific taste .
they ca n't get an order right to save their lives .
they try , i 'll give em that .
terrible .
just wish the service would have been what we were used to there .
we had the grilled chicken sandwich , pizza , and a burger .
took _num_ minutes to get more fries .
waitress constantly ignored our table .
poor service .
would n't recommend this place during peak times if you want decent service .
someone had to go and tell her that she had forgotten .
not cool when you have three little kids .
my husband and i visited here for lunch today .
she came to take our drink order , _num_ diet , _num_ ice tea .
our drinks were filled and then our order was taken .
she told us the kitchen fell behind with the mad rush of lunch guests .
really , i felt like crying .
i 'm sure about _num_ minutes went by before we got our food .
not this time .
it will be a long time before we visit this establishment again .
i do n't get why everyone praises this place .
food was ok , service was ok .
i was there at _num_ pm and felt sick about _num_ mins after leaving .
and now , they are terrible !
opt for the rib tips instead .
i 'm not a fan of the smaller plates they serve the food on .
unfortunately , i 'm done with this place and do not plan on returning .
me and my family went here today and it was horrible !
burger and fries were cold .
there was nothing that was yumm about it .
we waited 5-10 minutes to be sat in a almost empty restaurant .
we did n't receive our food for _num_ minutes .
a regular burger should n't take that long .
this is the worse customer service i have ever received in a long time .
but there was no reason for this horrible customer service .
this used to be our favorite family restaurant , not any more .
a server called in sick .
they 'll say they are sorry and bring more in _num_ minutes .
other than the time it 's not so bad when you expect it .
he 'll say they are better than this and ask for another chance .
unfortunately there 's only so many of those to be had .
this place is disgusting .
took one bite and i could n't continue eating .
the changes are , sadly , not good .
when we received those , they were cold , as well .
if that is he case , there is something seriously wrong with the equipment .
they never ate at red robin .
there were _num_ of us .
my bill was over $ _num_ .
service horrible .
food even worse .
uncooked vegetables in the soup .
nothing was bottomless .
it was my worst experience in a restaurant .
they comped me for _num_ meals .
are n't they special .
horrible .
the food was slow and dry .
i wish i would have taken a picture .
my recommendation , get your free burger once a year but avoid other wise .
horrible experience !
i will not be back .
first off , we wanted _num_ different fries , one regular and one parmesan .
for some reason this red robin is n't good .
our group of _num_ waited for food and never received some of our food .
was very disappointing as this was not our usual experience .
no wait to be seated .
i was craving red robin so we stopped here for lunch .
at which point we left & drove through in n out .
not really a fan of this location , maybe not the business at all .
$ _num_ for a stack of onion rings ?
there were about _num_ rings on there not worth it !
my burger was almost $ _num_ .
wish i could give zero stars .
after eating a few bites i noticed the chicken was not cooked at all .
thanks for not charging me for that salad , really appreciate it ?
my small _num_ salad became _num_ !
i always buy my daughter gift cards for red robin .
this place is cheap for sure especially if you have no insurance .
for my initial exam it took over _num_ hours !
the only pro is the price .
i was still polite as she handed me back my id .
it 's more expensive and id be better off going somewhere else .
the staff is friendly , yes , but communication & efficiency lacks .
they 're so slow .
absolutely ridiculous .
was n't even able to get into my scheduled appointment .
the ladies at the desk were straight up rude .
we said no thank you and never went back there again .
awful place , do n't take your pet there .
and its really zero stars , just not available !
there was no need to operate on him !
i am giving this location a _num_ star , not because of the staff .
all they do for $ _num_ dollars is cut the nails .
there is trash everywhere and everything is rundown .
still no reaction .
he proceeded to ring up my _num_ items .
Neutral
if i could give this store negative stars , i would .
i have _num_ items , _num_ exactly the same .
really , _num_ items is too many for you ?
so as usual , poor customer service in this store .
i walked .
or they just do n't give a shit .
it 's always busy , with never enough cashiers .
terrible .
terrible .
terrible .
take my word for it , you will be sorry .
cheap prices but it is never an easy in & out at this place .
i 'm so sick of this place i just can not go back .
i wish the staff here cared more .
worst services i have ever experienced !
total assholes , worst customer services i ever experienced !
i hate this walmart with everything in me !
it 's horrible .
the service is horrific !
do not get your vehicle worked on in any way at this location !
ruined my whole day !
this place is awful .
i was appalled by the lack of customer service here .
1st tip , do n't ever go here on the weekends .
then walmart was about the customer .
the people they have working there are more trash and rude than decent .
not good customer service at all .
it 's just plain awful .
i hate getting stuck in this line .
this is the closest pharmacy to me but it might not be worth it .
the worst experience of my life .
a two hour affair , which did n't make us all too happy .
for walmart , they have so many items which is a pro and con .
how many good things can be said about walmart , really ?
i went to a photo kiosk and requested about _num_ photos .
i do not blame the associates for this problem , i blame the company .
this was a ridiculous experience and i will not be returning .
do n't feel safe at this walmart .
people are beyond rude .
this is nowhere close to industry standards it is very cheap and tacky .
the customer base here is very poor and very diverse .
it always smells like sewage when you first walk into the entrance near mcdonalds !
the pharmacy is slow !
and the staff is rude !
my doctor put in five request for one prescription never got filled .
this is crap .
at this point i am so frustrated !
without us there is no pay check for you !
i have n't even put my order in .
ugh , i feel so bad .
for the worse .
it 's so gross .
bad customer service .
people there are just horrible !
nasty !
i ca n't believe people consider this a great authentic local spot .
ca n't even get a bean and cheese burrito done properly .
nasty place ... wo n't go back !
not going to happen since i live _num_ miles away .
she stated my order was not oily since they only heat their food .
we will not be back .
same quality as subway , just a higher price tag .
will not visit again .
sandwich was mediocre .
the bread reminded me of elementary school lunch .
this place just lost a few customers .
the customer service was awful !
i did n't even taste the cheese .
the food is n't terrible .
but it also is n't as good as jimmy johns .
this one guy behind the kitchen window never smiles .
ordered a tuna sub and one bite .
it was so dry .
the pickle was old looking , but i did n't try it .
instead he was busy trying to open the cash register .
so i said , i guess i 'll just grab my refund and go .
never going back .
poor all the way around .
the subs are great , the service is just horrible .
i do however , really care if i have to live with roaches .
this place was my living nightmare .
it makes me frustrated to even think about it .
the management was unprofessional and uncaring , and blamed him for bringing them .
these guys are liars , and blamed my husband for their mistake .
disgusting .
i wanted so badly to like you ... .
i can tell you which neighbors are having relationship problems .
why must i know these things ?
the sound is n't even my biggest issue .
since living here , we have never once received a correct bill .
rent was wrong .
tax was wrong .
worst renting experience of my life .
despite contacting management , nothing changed .
i have never had an issue with neighbors , residence in my lifetime .
but i suppose i should mention the bowling alley .
`` just throwing it out there , '' he said .
just kidding - you know i love ya , dude .
crappy video game selection .
horrible food .
this was my first time to this particular alley .
the building is plain , late _num_ 's decor .
there are tables and chairs randomly placed through out the building .
whole chunks missing out of several spots in the tile .
the handicapped stall has a baby changing station that does not fold up .
_num_ small sodas ran me over $ _num_ .
lane _num_ occasionally goes completely dark while people are bowling .
i would never , ever come to this bowling alley again by choice .
they should have closed this one instead .
chicken was tasty .
pretzels were horrible !
there are a couple of distinct reasons to why i give a lower rating .
there were not too many people that night .
they raised all of their prices august 1st .
under staffed terrible service .
if you want a beer your forget it .
turned out to be the absolute worst bowling experience ever .
even the manager , was constantly giving us the stink face .
i will never return to this awful location .
snack bar is over priced and below average .
with friends , but i go elsewhere for a just plain bowling fun .
there was clear disappointment on his face .
so sad , i used to have such a good time at these lanes .
expect to pay tons of money and get shirt service .
i 've had many problems with the service at this location .
they also usually take a long time to get my order out to me .
they do n't wear gloves .
disgusting .
no cheese was said by her twice and by me twice .
huge cheese all over my sandwich .
had half of a sandwich with just egg and bottom biscuit .
thanks bk in _num_ e southern ave , mesa .
i ca n't imagine how horrible they would be if they were busy .
so i stop , but only if i have time .
this is your typical burger king .
it was overcooked , and too salty .
i almost dread going everytime because the staff is always horrible .
ive tried going to different locations but the staff is rude at each one .
they are never helpful .
i have no problems with the staff here .
my problem is with items i need never being in stock .
so annoying and such a waste of my time .
however , the way a business deals with a situation is the key .
they did none of the above .
ultimately , one bad experience can cost a business _num_ - _num_ lost customers .
they did n't and i am talking to my attorney .
clearly i would like to tan : ) .
bottom line ... .
the rule is ridiculous and there customer service skills are lacking .
too many other amazing competitors in my neighbor .
terrible .
i switched to beach house tanning on gilbert .
this review has nothing to do with the employees .
everytime i went , the girls that worked there were great .
monday rolls around and no refund .
she still has n't had any communication with me at all .
it 's disorganized , messy , and frankly ... behind on the times .
horrible experience with this target .
this store has burned me for the last time .
now the item is sold out and i have been screwed .
rude and condescending front end manger .
i told them there were no signs and i was buying them for family .
i ended up purchasing one and giving it to my mom .
was not able to find shoes .
there were no shoes we could purchase .
highly disappointed .
i never go to target because of the prices not being the best value .
i probably would n't stay here again .
worst hotel experience ever .
she did however miss a significant portion .
but he never told me anything when i left .
do not come here bad service and liars !
repaired a tire that should not have been repaired .
lost the nut that holds my spare .
hate them !
when i opened an account here , this fee did n't exist .
do not use this institution for any of your home financing needs .
big mistake !
even to their own customers they have given all parties involved a horrible experience .
the buyers in this transaction are extremely strong and very low risk .
her name is tammy roberts -- make sure never to use her .
so everyday this house does n't close , he is losing money .
their prices are extremely inflated !
i have no clue how this place is still in business .
do not go here if you have questions !
so i went on with my question .
i could n't believe how horrible of a store it was .
i will never walk into that store again .
i would n't necessarily recommend this location too much after sunset .
they said they only have deals monday through wednesday .
as today is saturday they claimed not to have any deals .
i could never get off hold whenever i called to place an order .
i hung up after _num_ minutes .
terrible .
literally the worst customer service !
everytime i try to order food they ca n't seem do anything right .
very rude !
this store is not professional and very rude !
they could careless as long as they get your money .
was within _num_ min of promised time so that was ok .
what i got was pizza swimming in sauce !
terrible delivery service .
you 're better off doing carry out .
he was a little more helpful , helped me get my label printed .
and on top of all of this , they failed to bring any chopsticks .
i really think i should apply to work there in their kitchen .
and i was trained by real chinese chefs .
if you are reading this : you need me in your kitchen .
anyways , enough about me disappointing experience .
i lived in the far east for years , half my family is chinese .
the chinese say my cooking is better than the restaurants .
the worst `` chinese food '' i ever ate .
there was a sign help wanted in the window , i know why .
he refused .
worst office ever .
rude staff .
definitely the worse place i have ever been to .
very unprofessional and rude people .
not only that but he looked unprofessional .
this is not a place i would never go back to !
waited _num_ minutes after entering the room .
very long wait times .
if i could leave _num_ stars i would .
place was dirty , very unorganized .
front desk tells me they could not find me in the system .
then told me they did find me in the system but rescheduled my appointment .
i then tell them it is not a male doctor it 's a female .
very unorganized and lack of communication amongst the staff .
united blood services scheduling services are the worst i have ever experienced .
facility supervisor said they had no control on the scheduling .
most employees we tried to contact did n't even bother to return our calls .
in the past two years however , something has changed .
the food was all right , but the service was slow and unfriendly .
i do n't know if owners changed or what but it went downhill fast .
the service got awful and the quality of the food got bad too .
i was staying at the la quinta down the street .
poor , poor customer service .
unfortunately , the sprint employee was wrong .
disappointing .
agent says `` wow you have been a customer for _num_ years '' .
seriously such a crappy place .
they all sit around and do nothing .
no wonder they all just were sitting around not making any sales .
he told me it would cost me _num_ to fix the phone .
so i bought the junk which ended up being _num_ total .
now suddenly i have to pay _num_ more to get my phone back !
i complained but they made me pay the bullshit charge .
this place makes me sick !
the worst customer service i have ever come in contact with .
do not believe these other reviews , i am sure they are students there .
horrible service and bad attitudes is all i got from this place .
went here today to try and fix a broken tooth .
i do n't see how i can give that a review .
the person i kept getting could n't even answer my question !
remember , these are young students , they have no experience .
do n't make my mistake , please stay away from this place .
they wo n't treat me .
i needed an exam because my tooth had a small black spot .
they would n't look at it .
a few weeks later a piece of my tooth breaks off .
wasted my time and money for a 3rd time .
they think they are doing me a favor , no they are fucking me .
incompetent idiots .
they do n't even take blood pressure correctly .
not laying in a dentist chair with your feet up .
i guess i 'm going to mexico for a root canal now .
it 's ridiculous that they did this to me over and over .
honestly this is just a terrible doctor and even worse human being .
horrible doctor !
the worst dr. experience ( s ) i have ever had .
unethical , unprofessional , and just plain rude .
it was $ _num_ .
this is highly unethical , and i think might even be illegal .
finally , they called me back and left a voicemail .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
would not recommend .
i would highly recommend him .
my doctor is n't my complaint , however .
my complaint is getting an appointment .
_num_ minutes on hold to inquire about making a new patient appointment .
_num_ minutes on hold to make the appointment .
_num_ minutes on hold to cancel .
if i could give zero stars i would .
there is no reason for such excessive hold times .
staff on the phone was very short and unpleasant .
this place is completely frustrating .
sadly , that is not enough reason for me to continue going here .
it never fails .
not good .
i asked to see another doctor and was told i could n't .
he called twice to make an appointment and never received a return call .
they clearly do n't care .
do n't go to this office .
that 's not the worst part .
i was prescribed the wrong medication .
i would strongly advice to stay away !
still no response .
is n't that why you opened your doors ?
horrible experience .
i went in to get checked out for an ear infection .
no biggie .
the receptionist said that she would send it over right away .
i waited _num_ more minutes and still no prescription !
boy was i wrong !
an hour later and still no word from their office .
i will not be going back !
i left another voicemail for her .
this is not a family medical facility .
more like an urgent care facility at best .
less than impressed on my first visit .
took _num_ minute to call me to the desk to take my co pay .
do not count on them to do what they say they will do .
many of the front office staff are not customer service trained .
now it is time to put my money where my mouth is .
they where very cheap , but they did a horrible job on my nails .
i will never use this walgreens pharmacy again .
said it was much better and would last longer .
they also give really bad nail jobs .
central location , awful execution of ice cream creations .
i used to shop there frequently .
the prices were competitive and the employees were helpful .
the employees are rude and unfriendly .
there are a lot of books though , will give you that .
insulting .
save your books and sell at a garage sale , seriously !
i would actually give this place zero stars .
i did not realize it and neither did the employee until later that night .
the library actually tried to press charges on me for this .
rude !
excuse me ?
she said i was gone for hours .
i will not be back .
i 'm not sure why people give this bookstore a good rating !
you can buy used books for less almost anywhere else .
you can go to any other used bookstore and get a better deal .
it 's way past its prime .
feels more like a walmart .
it 's like she had never done it in her life .
sorry , woman .
i wish to never come across her customer service .
so i got the email that it was ready for pick up .
a little understanding and customer service would be nice .
and why is there just employees standing around not helping this ridiculously long line .
i called and they told me that they could n't find it .
seriously the worst experience ever .
undercooked fries and 1/3 of my burger missing `` from cooking '' !
i have only been here _num_ time and that will be it for me .
Negative
i gave _num_ star because there is no room for a negative .
i guess my _num_ star will go for the onion rings .
however , i 'm disappointed with the management at this particular location .
we left a call back number , etc .
the manager was very rude and said `` you wee supposed to call '' .
manager was very rude and annoyed that we even wanted to attempt the challenge .
good food but poor management .
chicken sandwich is a joke .
size of a kids burger and horrible value .
thumbs down this time .
brandon will never eat there again .
i got a fried chicken sand and it was awful !
it tasted like it was fried in old oil .
then there was no honey mustard which i have always loved !
i sampled my kids fries and they were cold and limp .
it wo n't be a huge loss , either .
horrible service .
do n't waste your time here .
hungry commission driven focused on the sale not the customer .
business must be slow .
they wasted my time and i wasted my money on them .
ridiculous and i got attitude on top of it all .
and they were exceptionally rude especially the girl at the counter !
this place was horrible .
she was very unfriendly and spent maybe two minutes with my dog .
we went to pick it up , they could not find the order .
so am not shopping there again !
i really only shop in tools , though that too will soon be changing .
i instead ended up in the electronics .
i would stay away from this location .
i arranged for a rental car sunday for monday morning .
enterprise was supposed to pick me up around 8am .
i had plans for this morning and now i wo n't make my appointments .
big inconvenience and they 've now lost my business .
i needed a car rental for business frequently but they are not reliable .
and i 'm the only person here .
there was _num_ person here when i got here .
now they tell me the car they have for me is out of gas .
this is ridiculous .
but they did n't keep my spice bottle from san diego .
everything left in car should be in lost and found .
every time i come to this location everything is so poorly organized .
was craving some wings so thought we 'd catch the game here and indulge .
the worst part is that both times they acted like it was our fault .
i would n't send my worst enemy to this body shop !
the staff was friendly and i was given a prompt and thorough estimate .
that 's pretty lousy service .
arizona , late april , _num_ degrees .
no star at all !
i could not believe how inconsiderate this staff was when checking out .
i 'm _num_ years old and they acted like we ripped our room apart .
i told them in not so nice words that was n't going to happen .
if the price is $ _num_ , then tell me that .
the total was $ _num_ after all the taxes and fees .
for what you get , i felt that we were overcharged .
this is not acceptable to me .
sounds like a flat out lie if i ever heard one .
no worries ... you will not get my business again .
that left a bad taste in my mouth .
they are you equivalent competitor are n't they ?
the servers , however , are very friendly and helpful .
this has changed however , after visiting this location .
what i did n't expect was a bad burger .
at this location however , it was terrible .
seriously , it was bad .
the bacon one of course was a dollar more .
wrong !
never , never , never come into this _num_ & diner !
Neutral
if i could , this place really needed negative stars !
nice _num_ 's atmosphere albeit noisy .
had breakfast of eggs , ham and `` home fries . ''
potatoes were frozen from a bag , not fresh .
service was mediocre .
the mashed potatoes were good , i ate those .
everytime we 've gone our orders are messed up in one way or another .
disappointed , but not a deal breaker .
as i 'm eating i 'm watching the waitresses and hostess make toast .
i 'm so disgusted by this place .
went before a ball game for a late breakfast .
the food is horrible .
the staff including the manager are very rude and the entire establishment was filthy .
my food was wrong twice until i simply gave up and went without .
horrible service , extremely slow and unfriendly .
waited _num_ min for drinks and another _num_ for our food .
i did not want to touch any of the condiments .
too bad .
no stars !
do n't the owners care ?
just got back from _num_ & diner on southern and where do i begin ?
let 's start with the horrible flies !
the atmosphere is n't bad , the food could be better .
our food was cold and they use frozen patties for burgers .
i did n't eat my fries , did n't like the flavor .
only ate one of my sliders could n't eat the second one .
customer service was good , they did n't charge me for my meal .
still will not be back .
- had a smell of a grease trap when i walked in !
the server was told , and nothing done !
will not be back !
they end up splitting us into _num_ different tables ( not a problem ) .
making us feel uncomfortable .
we should have taken it as a sign and walked out .
everything after that was awful .
by the time we got our food , it was cold .
shame on you .
not worth the aggravation or time !
this is in regards to fedex store on _num_ s. power rd .
mesa , az _num_ .
i went to this employee and was never even acknowledged .
this was not a good experience .
i will not be using fed ex or recommending you in the future .
customer service is not your first or even second priority .
save yourself the trouble go somewhere else .
she continued to clean and not acknowledge my presence .
this place needs a real renovation to deserve those room charges .
there were no real pillows in our room .
did i mention i was suppose to leave by 5am ?
i sent an e-mail to management .
it 's been ignored so far .
the suite was very small .
they canceled the shuttle with nothing more than an `` oh well . ''
there was a dirty picture drawn on the mirror in the bathroom .
food let 's just say ... not coming back to this one .
terrible , terrible , terrible customer service .
funny that about _num_ people walked out right after i did .
ill be taking my business elsewhere .
i think she was just being lazy .
lazy !
if i had known , i would have simply made them myself .
hundreds of dollars was wasted .
i spend several hours with the hotel staff and told me stuff .
only after that did they refund the money .
i understand the mistake , it happens .
i do n't known , if i would stay here again .
no one said anything to us .
so , imagine my surprise when the bill came to $ _num_ .
we will not adjust your bill . ''
no conditioner or lotion ?
probably not .
painfully slow internet !
why have free wifi unless it can actually stream something .
worst internet ever !
get paper proof that you 've paid if you stay here .
do not trust what the front desk personnel tell you .
horrible customer service !
my husband purchased _num_ suits .
no problem , i thought .
wrong !
i would never recommend this store .
selection was good but customer service was horrible .
this second associate answered three phone calls before beginning to ring me out .
meanwhile , i 'm still standing at checkout just waiting to pay .
it took twenty minutes to pay for my five items and leave .
after standing around for about _num_ minutes different associate finally walked up .
just do n't go here .
the people are rude and miserable and have no intention of actually helping you .
i wish i could give this location _num_ stars .
first she acts like we do n't know anything .
the worst part , they barely gave him any of his money back .
awful manager would not even give him the time of day .
they only gave him $ _num_ .
when they talked to the manager he was completely rude with awful service .
the staff was friendly , food ok for az .
salsa is ok , just not as good as most restaurants .
i waited over _num_ min to even get a menu .
i ate the salsa and chips and was getting sick .
i could not find my waitress .
still sick the next day stomach will not settle down .
this is the third time i have had bad service .
i will not go back again .
once i get sick from something i ate will not return .
btw it was not that crowded to were the service was bad .
no chairs = boo .
there was a time that this was n't too bad of a corporate restaurant .
however , it would seem things have took a turn for the worst .
we finally got up and walked out in frustration and disappointment .
after several months of staying away , we returned to give it another shot .
