the rivets are hard to clean ,  but that s standard for riveted cookware . 
it s a good tool and one i ll use often . 
the only reason i gave this product num_num stars on amazon is because of the price .

it is a lovely scarlet red and quite heavy . 
lets me plug in a keyboard or mouse  or both  . 
i can see what other reviewer meant about hand fatigue but i still dig it . 
the grounds are higher up the sides of the basket and more evenly distributed in the filter . 
i added a second phone to the num_extend and it connected great . 
and i use the speakerphone aspect of the jambox with my cell phone . 
i did discard the first waffle i made and the num_extend one was just fine . 
thank god i got this !  i never had a tub with an overflow drain before . 
our house is elevated and we have a big deck around it . 
however ,  once i decided to actually read the instructions viola !  everything worked perfectly and easily . 
scrub gently with veggie brush and it cleans easy . 
lots of different options and lots of different dishes . 
the zojirushi is quiet during operation and is just a well built appliance . 
i tried several different jars and lids .  .  . no luck . 
my old waffle iron broke ,  so i got this one to replace it . 
you can repeat this process num_num or num_num times if you want to be thorough . 
the boiling causes the fat to emulsify with the liquid in an irreversible chemical event . 
they are way better than the motorola set and are so comfortable !  . 
always a great item to have when you are traveling and people want to see your screen . 
i took everyones advice and cut bags extra long and this has given us a number of reuses . 
it was suggested that i use an electric knife as they have longer blades and of course are faster . 
nice set  ,  cleans with ease and color is classy . 
we brew on this machine an average num_num times a day . 
this charger lets me charge my iphone num_num and new ipad mini retina with no problems . 
i cooked a small beef roast with onions and carrots and it was great . 
it plays all games . the gps could be betterthe call quality seems to be deteriorating a little . 
it is simple to insert ,  very easy to clean ,  and my treats come out perfectly . 
the best one i have tried in this maker ,  though ,  islavazza crema e gusto ground coffee ,  italian espresso . 
i love these i have used them with oranges and pepper rings . 
using it with music from phone  pandora  it auto switches and fades volumes as you would hope . 
i am new to baking and needed a bundt pan . 
highly recommended if you don t want multiple chargers laying around . 
takes up a bit of space ,  but i can live with that . 
i like the ease and convenience of the roomba vacuum . 
it saves space and money since i don t need two chargers in the car . 
my concerns were assuaged by how really well this knife works . 
the qwerty touchscreen is really good and i have almost mastered it . 
i m going to keep this review short and simple . 
unless it touches the cheek bone it doesn t work well at all  hence the name jawbone  . 
i ve not had any problems with how it works . 
i ve had a couple of different plugs and they all worked . 
would iron man buy this pan ?  who cares .  .  . iron man doesn t cook for himself . 
this one is definitely cheaper made than the old one . 
holds things in both directions ,  doubling the capacity . 
i was so happy with this product i now eat popcorn ever second of every day . 
the armature is also easily removed for simple cleaning . all in all ,  an excellent buy . 
saving lots of money by smoking our own meat or even just buying a precooked ham or turkey breast . 
you won t use any other ,  once you get it in your hands . 
i have tried the wired fm transmitters and i must say that this one is awesome to be wireless . 
you need to be more thorough about cleaning it because the spoiled milk will smell . 
therefore ,  it is necessary to mount it on the edge of the counter to let the handle rotate completely . 
i was fortunate to find this new one on amazon . com . 
item comes in a nice case and works perfectly . 
after an initial splash ,  no water should flow . 
holding down the main button on the num_extend will activate voice dialer . 
overall this case has been great for the price . 
there is no coffee maker that can make as good a cup as the braun num_extend
next we gave a meatloaf recipe a try . 
i have num_num other globals and this one is as good as the rest . 
like not even a teaspoon it makes much more palatable popcorn with no need for butter . 
thanks goodness pyrex still makes glass measuring cups . 
good value and is easy to spot when dropped on the floor . 
one of the earpiece is longer than the other but what i have done is just clipped it off . 
i purchased two ,  one for me and then my daughter . 
we might use our old salt and ice freezer for a planter or something . 
the sound quality is excellent for both making calls and listening to music on your phone . 
the three bowls included really make this machine convenient . 
a bit of advice :  lookup how to change it on youtube . 
acquiring this charger from the oem shop saved me a lot of money and aggravation . 
then the company got a hold of me and refunded my money because i wasn t totally satisfied . 
do i really need to type more words amazon ?  !  . 
good to know they aren t messing up a good thing . 
i m not using this to make coffee per se . 
there was a sticker on the bottom that was not easily removed . 
i will enjoy this pan fo years to come . 
the water gets very hot and will eventually reach close to a boil . 
this granpappy is just about right for the limited deep frying that we do . 
it s incredibly easy to clean as well ! definitely recommended . 
the inner case of the defender is hard plastic ,  with the outer case being soft rubber . 
the charging port is located on the inner side of the left arm behind swinging mini door . 
it is nice and snug ,  not soft and flimsy like another one i rated . 
i bought a few of these because i have so many mini usb chargers and cables . 
we also plan to purchase some of the attachments for it . 
bought the same case in black just to have a different color ,  switch it up . 
i needed num_num batteries for my evo num_extend phones . 
did a lot of research before settling on this pressure canner . 
i have multiple devices that need to be charged while i work on the road . 
ot constant while squeegeeing or mopping with it . 
it also might not fit well with some automotive plug locations . 
the jambra supreme is a little pricier than some of these headsets ,  but less than the plantronics products . 
also goes well with the iphone black or white . 
they take the lid off measure the popcorn and dump it in . 
this is a classic bread knife that works very very well . 
the phone has been banged around and keeps on working . 
slimmer than all my phones ,  charges all and any phone without glitches . 
hi ,  i got this for myself :   my mom used to make these when i was a kid . 
i bought this in hopes i could use it to organize my headband collection and it works for me . 
proctor silex num_extend num_num liter electric kettle is an amazing product . 
it is super strong ,  perfect for phone screen replacement . 
this is almost everything we expected from reading the reviews . 
all they need to do is reverse which way it hinges and it would work much better . 
but this is one product that quite literally makes life easier for me on a daily basis . 
but .  .  . the sharpness of the blades creates a potential safety hazard . 
i d prefer it warn you once and just stop working than to continue to beep until it powers off . 
lodge quality is excellent and this should last for decades . 
it s surprising how much dust this item can catch in my house . 
sorry i don t rate products with num_num stars unless they are perfect . 
if you re like me and can t stand a tangled cord ,  this thing is perfect for you . 
very slim ,  not rubbery so lint won t stick to it while in your pocket or purse ,  and cheap . 
this was the easiest ice cream i ve ever made . 
i like it because you can get it in any color you like . 
i ve been thinking about it again and decided i had to have one ,  and decided on the waring model . 
excellent kitchen shears ,  feel nice in the hand ,  just the right weight . 
have never used anything else so have no comparison . 
it makes delicious coffee ,  and only has a couple parts to clean . 
the first thing i cooked in it was polenta .  .  .  . usually a gooey ,  sticky mess to clean up . 
i ve heard they re only slightly different from this model num_extend but the differences are positive . 
not really much more you can say ,  it holds its place on the counter and doesn t scratch easily . 
pathetic . these headphones are usb ,  which i paid no attention to ,  none whatsoever . 
easy to clean and well worth the price ,  which i thought long and hard about spending money on . 
feels somewhat flimsy but gets the job done . 
it works fine but my palm phone is broken so i can t use it . 
i like that is is a product made on this side of the continent . 
also ,  apparently looking at a friggin clock is too difficult so we have to buy a timer . 
no quality issues .  .  . they are real and work as they should . 
cleaning is a snap and results of cooking are standout . 
however that hasn t been a hindrance as the switch is still accessible and can be moved without much problem . 
all the openings and ports are cut perfectly . looks great on iphone and protects it . 
good for light everyday tasks ,  has an fm radio reciever built in ,  requires headphones as an antennae . 
this is the perfect starter set for home cooks . 
i can say one thing it is a good product . 
what caught my eye was the specified use for dorm rooms . 
it s the crank that gives out then the pot is retired for use in the garage . 
it can be taken apart to clean  as a tinkerer ,  i like this  . 
the colors are even more beautiful in person than the pictures . 
i used it as my main music player because the user interface is better than the stock music player . 
this charger is well constructed and the charge lasts for a long time . 
the dimensions num_num x num_num x num_extend are etched on the underside of the container . 
the people who commented on the lids not working were half right . 
i love collecting fiesta dinnerware and have been thoroughly pleased with each piece purchased through amazon . 
it can be plugged into a wall or into your computer !  . 
the last num_num i got from verizon for $ so this one was a good price . 
getting the cone separated from the pin that inserts to the motor is very difficult . 
the recipe booklet shipped with this is a great source of foods to create using this cooker . 
it sucks up har ,  dirt ,  and all of the shavings leftover from cleaning out guinea pig cages . 
we all love the cases and are very happy with them . 
i find these fun to use for eggs and pancakes . 
great cord and is compatible with my iphone num_extend
why complain about it ?  it is silly to blame ceramics for being ceramics . 
the veggies ,  cut them into bite size pieces . 
and while we unabashedly admit that we make heavy use of our kitchen items ,  we do not abuse them . 
so i purchased this inexpensive cable to charge my phone during the day . 
this isn t like the big dumb looking iphone . 
it is a little on the heavy side ,  but it s worth the trouble . 
i have a large collection of fiesta ware and love adding new pieces . 
after researching for  that  perfect screen protector for weeks ,  i found this screen protector . 
not to mention ,  i don t know how i would have pulverized those home made croutons . 
the new item is from a new batch and fits perfect . 
you can lift the vacuum by the canister handle . 
i like them because you can see to clean them and they come in functional sizes . 
this is my husbands favorite case !  it came in perfect time . 
i didn t really expect to see any increase in battery life and i was right . 
i have used these trivets for hot food ,  cold drinks ,  and for potted plants . 
this is my third speck iphone case ,  and they have all been great . 
get one you will love it and you might even want to buy a spare for this price . 
the handles on my press are on tight and have never just come off . 
i do wish that the lights were a little brighter ,  or possibly multicolored . 
i dont know what more there is to say ?  works as expected . 
you will get many more cycles if each cycle is only a partial cycle ,  and not a complete discharge . 
i can only imagine that some of the problems experienced by other reviewers is due to improper use . 
this is product is a outstanding buy and it a good price for my phone . 
these knifes are very heavy duty and if kept in the block when not used ,  should last a lifetime . 
it fits my iphone num_num well and also fits my daughters iphone num_extend
slicing meats and homemade breads was a big pain . 
this works great to make popcorn without oils or salts . 
the cuisinart die cast can opener features a tall design capable of opening even the tallest cans . 
there are a couple jabra apps in the marketplace ,  but nothing that serves these purposes . 
we use it almost weekly for manicotti ,  enchiladas ,  cornbread ,  etc . 
simplicity is a designvalue and this device shows that . 
it provides minimal protection ,  but just enough imo to handle a short drop . 
it says right on the side :   marble board  . 
good quality product ,  but i would prefer glass instead of plastic . 
this is the best grill that i have every owned . 
i have really enjoyed using this product everyday . 
the juice flows out very fast in a steady stream . 
all the button openings are in the correct place ,  the camera also . 
the stainless steel finish is easy to clean and looks great . 
product arrived on schedule and in good condition . 
 ewwwwww !   so i decided to splurge on one that would never have this problem . 
it s really a nice effect ,  and something i hadn t considered or expected when i bought this pan . 
keep it oiled and it will last a lifetime . 
fortunately ,  it doesn t seem to need a tight fit at the top to work . 
i recomend this product ,  but you cannot use it outdoors . 
my grandson is num_num and he loves this lunchbox . 
the light changes color accurately to indicate readiness . 
other than this ,  they both seem to be durable and rugged . 
only the glass lids and the aluminum at the edges could be damaged from washing in the dishwasher . 
this mounts very well on all areas of both sized vehicles . 
they hold up so well to the daily wear and tear of life . 
i keep up on all my reading and more .  .  .  . awesome phone . 
i expect a very slight escape of steam where they join . 
great sound quality and i don t get tangled up . 
i purchased this book without taking the course . 
and ,  since it s using all that fuzzy logic stuff it has no idea when it s going to finish . 
it s beautifully designed and holds it heat . i am so pleased with it . 
this spatula set gives you three useful tools at a reasonable price . 
having several in a package as back up is very conveniant . 
this setting is only intended for bare tiled or wood floors . 
storing it is also easier with the more compact size . 
did not have to make coffee as often . 
their design is attractive and basic ,  and you know the benefits of pyrex . 
as long as the eggs are liquid ,  they are not too hot to melt the plastic . 
just soak a bit in hot water and vinegar or spray with dawn degreaser foam . 
there isn t much to say about round cutters . 
especially the cheap grinders are certainly no bargain . 
easy to use and i love the fact that they are disposable . 
yes ,  it is not meant to do large areas of rugs . 
i wish cuisinart would invent one for their prep plus processors . 
it cleans nicely without a lot of work . 
i ve had my farberware stainless steel nonstick skillet for a year and four months . 
this headset was very easy to setup and pair ,  both with my computer and my cell phone . 
the design of this grater makes it very stable and handy . 
we have whole house beige carpet and a long hair german shepherd . 
if it gets dirty i just toss it into the dishwasher . 
we use kernal hagenbauker s popcorn for a very tasty snack !     .  .  .    . 
;o the main intention obviously is baking bread ,  and it really does do a great job . 
i experimented filling it with water and picking it up by the handle on the top when locked . 
this plantronics voyager pro hd works great ,  very clear ,  i m happy i spent the extra money . 
all buttons and cutouts seem to be in the right place . 
just put a jump ring and add a keychain or cell phone charm attachment . 
the dark color makes the cake dook great . 
we ordered this because we have two small children that have destroyed our carpet  lol  . 
this item has every size you could possibly want and then some all in a nice ,  neat ,  compact unit . 
i use this constantly for brewing kombucha and it s never given me any problems . 
granted ,  i m a road warrior and my earbooms probably go through more abuse than a casual user . 
well made in the usa and using it is so much more satisfying than a pizza wheel . 
so much that i bought one for her phone and some friends and relatives asked where we got them . 
i take num_num elevator rides a day and people always look so the screen serves my purpose . 
bought this for my wife  per her request  and we both love it . 
much easier than trying to clean the solidified grease out of the plastic doohickey . this was a very pleasant suprise . 
the protector also enables you to keep your screen clean . 
i clean it within a few minutes of using it and it cleans up beautifully . 
i purchased this timer to track my dji phantom flight times . 
lol i see him sleeping in there every night . 
it is inexpensive ,  easy to get on ,  fits perfectly ,  and doesn t pick up dust like silicone . 
i think that this whisk will last forever . 
not only in vegetable prep but also dough making and baby food ,  among many other things . 
my wife thinks they are too heavy for her ,  but i like them . 
it was very well designed and works well with my iphone num_extend
the replacement set arrived today and was packed correctly this time and in perfect condition . 
i haven t been able to bend one yet . 
i suppose most people don t notice this ,  but this definitely makes a difference in charging time . 
i do like the cloth that they included with the packet of protectors . 
i had ordered this coffee maker through kohl s when they were having a sale . 
it is the perfect edition to the home espresso machine . 
a bit large for its practicality on the dining room table . 
we are very pleased ,  no regrets about not buying the one that cost $ more . 
i installed a second booster next  not on top of  to the first one . 
i lost a similar one and was looking to replace it . 
this egg cooker seems to be of the same quality and cooks perfect eggs . 
got this for my num_num year old wife for christmas and she is completely enamored with it . 
i took a picture ,  thinking i could post it here . 
i used my label maker and made nice labels for each one ,  they even fit bay leaves nicely . 
the case fits easily and securely into holster for easy access . 
never had an issue with any of them . 
it holds the products well and they seem secure . 
the oxo spins lettuce ,  cabbage ,  spinach quickly and easily . 
i have tiles in all of my rooms so i assume it might take a bit longer on carpeting . 
i love that it is very easy to clean . 
got tired of guesstimating and getting the stuff from the spoon to the sheet . 
it is a good value for the money . 
this vehicle dock is meant to work with the atrix num_extend phone ,  also from motorola . 
having now tested the duration of the extended battery its absolutely a longer life than the standard . 
i can t say my iphone num_num would look the same way though . 
the glove is a little stiff ,  and does not come on and off easily . 
the red was true to color as you see it in the photo and fits perfectly . 
our kitchen table is about num_extend to num_num feet away from the back of the sofa . 
this puppy is great ! big enough for any job ! and heavy !  real stainless steal !  . 
this is for cooking in a fire ,  above ,  or with coals . 
easier than going to the corner beverage emporium to buy one for $
easy to hold onto  good if you have kids !   . 
so this charger will help ,  but will not take your phone from num_num to % charge . recommended . 
no really that much grip on the back so it s sorta smooth but that s fine for me . 
the glass lids are very nice ,  and while the skillets are small ,  they re nice . 
bought two of these jars to add to my candy bar collection of apothecary jars and containers . 
the other paring knives clean wax out of candles now . 
i have purchased much more expensive kitchen utensils and have been very disappointed . 
i thought that a low speed setting for the mixer would be most appropriate . 
recommend this case for protection ,  for sleekness and looks . 
your guy will love his case ,  especially if he grew up in the era of cassettes . 
love the forwarding and stopping of the music . 
by far the best value for cases for this horrible phone . 
this device nearly made it to the five star category despite that shortcoming . 
very easy to clean ,  just get yourself a bottle brush . 
with the unit being very lightweight this isn t a concern . 
in the new pot doesn t hold a candle to a num_extend pot . 
this mandoline is so easy to set up ,  use ,  break down and clean that i keep it right handy . 
corn of the cob is one of his favorites and this device allows him to cook quickly between classes !  . 
i had some worry about using it on the ceramic cook top ,  but it works wonderful . 
this pan is well constructed and is made in the us . 
looks sharp ,  cost effective ,  saves your screen from scratches ,  good solution for screen protection . 
i mean ,  come on !  it s ok for me to pace all over the office ,  but not everyone else . 
i was skeptical at first ordering this product . 
they stay nice using even the sharpest knife . 
fortunately it is a new num_extend lte phone and we have an unlimited data plan . 
i have to touch the base to see if it s warm to know it s working . 
samsung galaxy note ii .  .  .  .  . first of all it did not want to go into my phone with out a fight . 
it lasts longer than my old one and it charges quicker than my old one too . 
it s nice to have something different to look at once in a while . 
if you are looking for a great bluetooth thisnis it . 
 yes ,  i said dishwasher .   though the earlier one could be washed in the dishwasher ,  it was too big . 
i ve been looking for just the right cordial glasses and these fit the bill . 
but when it arrived ,  it included everything along with usb . 
they are nice and seem to do the trick . 
i like it . design is functional and product puts together well . 
the num_extend is a bit intimidating as it s so heavy duty . 
also the electronics are much less likely to get wet ,  which is  we believe  why our old one died . 
i can get these with two day shipping for less than i can buy them in my local stores . 
shun also makes more expensive chef knives; but the classic line are perfect for my home cooking uses . 
i have owned all kinds of knives ,  expensive ones and cheap ones . 
the one draw back is the salad plate . 
would recommend and would by again if needed . 
touch screen is fairly responsive but could use some additional customization for num_extend
this knife looks great and performs even better . 
but i can see them when i am reading a book in ibooks  white background  . 
i have two myself that i use frequently . 
this works great ,  and is easy to assemble and disassemble for easy storage . 
these are great for entertaining and an easy meal . 
this larger screen makes typing on the virtual keyboard much more accurate and easier to use than smaller screens . 
it goes great with its lid and the lid fits nicely . 
i bought a new kitchen cart with small drawers . 
that being said ,  this is a great product . 
keep a watchful eye on your pot and it will do you a good job . 
easy to use ,  even if you have no clue about knife sharpening . 
i would suggest heating up both sides well before adding the batter . 
i just hope that honeywell reads these reviews and picks up on this flaw to improve in future models . 
we just got swamp with rain and i check nice and dry . 
they were inexpensive ,  but why replace them ?  this worked like a charm . 
also ,  it can be a bit hard to remove the case from your phone . 
without a doubt these are some of the finest little scissors around . 
they were very quick to ship me a product with high quality . 
if you think you will be using induction cooking ,  then calphalon will not work for you . 
best sneakers i ve ever worn ,  i m damn serious !  !  !  . 
it works but only for about num_num cups or less . 
used one at a cooking class and loved it . 
much better than a keurig of which i have owned a few . 
the large feet keep the rack from tipping over ,  especially if there are toddlers around . 
it is a great product at a great price and i would definitely recommend it !  . 
like apple ,  you can only purchase your apps from the included application on the phone . 
these suction cups are great depending on what your purpose of use is . 
so i called lodge and asked who was right . 
i thought this might be a sticking point but it is not an issue for me . 
this has worked it s magic ,  been using for grinding my fruit for jam . 
these are very pretty ,  delightfully heavy and substantial old fashioned glasses . 
this is the second purchase of this cover for my appliances and they are great . 
i think he s afraid of getting his gorgeous fluffy tail caught . 
i can t say enough great things about this bose headset . 
i think its about the same size ,  maybe a teeny bit bigger but not by much at all . 
and yes ,  it does get hot .  . coffeemakers do keep coffee pots hot . 
as usual ,  my samsung cell phone charger that i purchased through amazon was just what i ordered . 
if you hope to serve more than num_num people you will need something a lot larger than this . 
when it is plugged in and drawing power the disc turns blue . 
have one for butter and one for margarine . 
it stores well and is compact enough to leave out on the counter top . 
with the easy adjustment instructions you can make the grounds even finer than the dial indicates . 
after my first couple of months use i found that i got a stream rather than a spray . 
i first thought $ for a spoon ?  ?  !  !  but ordered it anyway because it looked good and sturdy . 
such a simple concept that i didn t think it was going to work !  works beautifully . 
my wife likes to bake ,  and she read in a magazine about cookie dough scoops . 
mounted in shower ,  used it to replace one that was really old and a different make . 
not to mention that you get added iron by just cooking in them . 
i get perfect size each and every time . 
this tumbler is very nice for keeping your drink hot . 
using the tray expands the types of foods you can dehydrate without making a big ,  hard to clean ,  mess . 
i tried it without anything but the popcorn as well as with a table spoon of oil . 
i recently purchased the hamilton beach num_num health smart and i love it . 
we used ceramic spoon rests but every one of them ultimately snapped at the handle s curve . 
it looks like it cost much more than it did . 
i can mix and proof dough ,  or use the stick blender to make a creamy soup . 
that type of mug will certainly keep drinks hot for hours . 
i used this pan for my son s birthday party . 
nevertheless ,  the fish eye and macro lens are great . 
feel safer now if it were to drop . 
i ve melted more than one of these plastic basters . 
i am not a wine connoisseur ,  and i like to enjoy a glass occasionally . 
doesn t have the  good vibes  of cast iron ,  and probably not the health benefits ,  either !  . 
my advice ,  plan on buying some separate cords . 
it is a nice case ,  fits well and it is easy to insert and remove my ipod touch . 
the breadman has started acting up and replacement parts are no longer available . 
i would recommend it for num_num foodies or num_num dieters . 
once a person has done this once they will never num_extend
this was very easy to install ,  is made sturdy and is exactly how it is described . 
i had to give my wife mine and purchase another one . 
these covered saucepans are very handy for different purposes . 
this arrived quickly and i had it assembled and full of items within num_num minutes . 
just remember the num_extend and num_extend use two different digitizers . 
he likes it ,  but thinks it is too big for one mug of coffee . 
i wish it was sold by amazon with measuring cups and spoons as i already have both . 
it feels like a nice solid device in the hand . 
i haven t had any issues with fraying threads or anything yet . 
my children grew up using it ,  and then it disappeared one day . 
it was an iphone problem not a problem with the headphones . 
i have gone through several different digital thermometers ,  all just didn t perform well . 
i do not like when amazon ships merchandise out in the original manufacturers  boxes . 
the unknown mvno cost $ for the device i believe ,  and it only receives num_extend
this lil device has cut back my oil consumption in cooking yet providing a lovely taste to my dishes . 
had to restart that phone because it couldn t get a gps signal for num_extend
the canister ,  the ring ,  the bowl ,  the scraper ,  the lid ,  and the turn handle . 
veggies need to be chopped into relatively small pieces and you have to feed them in num_extend
at this price and no shipping cost ,  grab yourself a few packs . 
this is a very nice little tea strainer . 
i like the idea of having a pen and tablet stylus in one product . 
before i place the order i was worried that it might not fit but it does . 
i use about num_num to num_num oz of milk for a num_num oz latte . 
i gave num_num stars instead of num_num because the actual hook on the suction cup could be bigger . 
i have a sturdier set that i like better ,  but then they are quality and were $
i own an assortment of peelers ,  and have tried several others at friends  homes . 
they clump up and foul the filter . pulse the motor until you have the correct consistency . 
the cuisinart ice cream maker lacks in capacity ,  so the obvious solution was to have a second freezer bowl . 
it does brew good enough coffee compares to starbucks  for us . 
good quality ceramic and it actually does what it says ,  . 
accepts larger spice containers and even olive oil bottles and vinegars . 
the battery lights are handy ,  since you have a good idea of how much charge is left . 
i hope that over time they don t get loose . 
htc hero is a very new product that i use for my personal use from sprint . 
the dough does not fall through the holes . 
with this i know i am using olive oil only with no other additives in it . 
if you don t do so ,  it can cause problems . 
on a num_num minute commute ,  i can go from % charge to % with bluetooth enabled . 
i bought this mixer before the num_extend ones were available about num_num years ago . 
it fits well ,  it s sturdy ,  and everything lines up; the metal buttons make it easy to use . 
i also enjoyed the additional mini features on the itorch . 
it does have a flashlight on it ,  but it is not very bright . 
we bought it on amazon ,  on sale for about $ with free shipping from   .  .  .   . 
i bought a large jug of kernels from a warehouse store and it seems like its bottomless . 
the num_extend produces consistantly even grounds with num_num adjustable settings for fineness . 
it strains fairly fine particles ,  is easy to clean and seems durable . 
have to be a bit careful with it ,  and maybe avoid slicing really hard butter . 
i ve wanted a good chef s knife for a while . 
the only kind of bagel that won t work in this slicer is the very fresh . 
they are then ground down to shape afterward . 
i have been very happy with these clips !  . 
i ve never seen a grinder with more flare then this one ,  plus it makes a great cup of coffee . 
i bought this for my husband whose over zealousness when wringing out a lime broke the plastic one . 
they seem to be great considering all the apps he continuously runs . 
i had this case on my blackberry for years . 
in fact ,  the eureka is so well designed that it seems to roll easier than the hoovers . 
now they re saving up for one ,  as they would like their own . 
the leather isn t real obviously but it s an attractive ,  simple case . 
it was a royal pain in the butt to use and clean . 
i love it !  i ve made all kinds of things in it and it does a great job . 
i had it paired with mylg num_extend num_extend phone ,  blue  verizon wireless within seconds . 
there are two tanks with one being portable so you can lift it out and fill it . 
takes about num_num hours . i have not used the battery yet . 
it should go with every bottle of wine that you take to a friend s house for dinner . 
i made a bunch of waffles and freezed most of them . 
the num_extend network is definitely getting faster ,  although possibly because they implemented a num_extend per billing cycle  soft cap  . 
being steel with no plastic coating i can set a hot pot on it which is good . 
good product i got it for my husband but he hasn t had any complaints about it . 
even more powerful than my old dyson !  i could hardly believe it when i turned it on . 
it s a perfect replacement and looks exactly like the original . 
wanted a conical burr grinder but could not justify the cost . 
it also seems to hold its edge well . of course ,  it works perfectly with cheese . 
the wallet part fits num_num cards ,  it can fit more because i ve jammed in the occasional num_extend card . 
if you want them ,  buy professional set at their official website . 
if some of the adjustments were more secure ,  it would have been perfect . 
it is reinforced where it needs to be and everything is accessible ,  even on verizon iphone num_extend
i have to cut veggies in hunks to put in chopper . 
in case you re wondering ,  it does not stand up to the teeth of a three month old puppy . 
this is the best butter cutter i have used . 
little black plug fits easily into earphone hole on num_extend and in num_extend hole with a stronger push . 
perhaps in the location of the speaker that pick up your voice . 
num_extend because the trigger that opens the spout is hard to open . 
i have used it and i love it !  it s very light and very deep . 
i lost one on a plane a few weeks ,  so this time i ordered two . 
the only problem i have is the switch stops working . 
very high quality product ,  excellent design for tea brewing ,  leakproof seal . 
it unlocked my pantech num_extend just like that . 
it is easy to clean and fits perfect in the coffee pot i just purchased . 
i have an iphone num_extend ipad num_extend and my children also have ipads . 
i needed a good burr grinder to use after i received an espresso machine for xmas . 
glides super easy ,  and is a breeze to clean . 
but from what i hear in other reviews ,  a lot of people have been dropping and breaking glass pots . 
spend a little bit money and get one that will last and are a pleasure to use . 
the scent of coffee made this way fills your house . 
this works great !  the top stays on with limited tossing around . 
give these guys a chance to help you . 
this makes the sensation even more desirable ,  also it s variety of customs roms available . 
okay ,  i don t proclaim to be a chef or even enjoy cooking all that much as a hobby . 
this residue can be seen in the light after washing and drying . 
turn a light on when you pour the water . 
i was pleasantly surprised how well both functioned . 
warm feet really do make a huge difference . 
it s a great addition to my collection of other rubbermaid spatula s . 
have always had good luck with theirappliances and cookware . 
you really are getting all the juice you can out of your produce . 
i am totally in love with this cooker . 
i may buy a couple more for my daughters to use too . 
i have noticed with some cans very fine flakes of sealant in the contents right along the edges . 
this worked perfectly and you can t even tell its there because of the overhang . 
now it takes me num_num seconds to prepare and num_num minutes to cook perfect poached eggs . 
i have not complaints it does the job perfectly and i have had no problems with it . 
i replaced the battery with this and it worked perfectly . 
looking for some extras so i ll have these for the rest of my life to use  :   . 
this keeper is a nice large garlic keeper . 
the person i was talking to heard me clearly and precisely ,  no background noise or clutter whatsoever . 
this one produces fine particles only .  .  .  . but i am happy with it and do highly recommend it . 
to my surprise the unit began to talk to me and tried to guide me through the setup . 
chicken wings and legs need to be secured with the elastic ties or butcher string . 
this is a very useful method to understand what s happening with the sharpener and with your knife blades . 
i had never purchased a product manufactured by lg but was pleasantly surprised . 
i made some cream of wheat in it for breakfast . 
i noticed the difference in the flavor of my coffee right away with this . 
out of all of my iron ware this one was so disgusting i washed it with soap . 
the knives were so lousy that we could barely cook . 
i m not sure why it s described as heavy duty . 
foods i don t like to package on top of one another in the package . 
the num_num quart artisan model is perfect for me . 
everyone seems to be missing the same points . 
dell s bluetooth module has always been problematical ,  so i will assume it is the computer and not the jabra . 
my vacuum cleaner now works like it s brand spanking new !  . 
it s the easiest coffee maker i ve ever had ,  and still use it nearly every day . 
great price ,  and i would recommend to anyone . 
that includes the charger hole ,  headphone port and hdmi port . 
it was a bit difficult to cut through the apple . 
i really needed an extra battery because i use my phone for work a great deal of the time . 
the silicon layer is not really for protection ,  its just so the second layer doesn t ruin the phone . 
it is thick and hefty but not heavy . 
it s pretty large ,  so would be good for washing greens as well as draining pasta . 
i was looking for the ultimate machine that would get num_num stars; there isn t such a machine . 
i do recommend a plantronics unit over this simply due to the features on it . 
otterbox is the absolute best case for cell phones . 
for cleanup you can just throw it in the dishwasher and it s good to go . 
ive only used it a few times and its worked fine . 
i can t know how it s going to hold up at this point ,  but it appears very sturdy . 
not more but if you have num_num extra batteries like me this charger really you will like it . 
the skewers help you make perfect sates ,  kebabs or large vegetables . 
great price ,  product fit the phone well ,  came on time . 
i often eat cereal and ice cream out on the patio and hold the bowls in my hand . 
mine did not come on package displayed on picture but after all it works so who cares !  !  . 
i also reset the phone to no avail . 
i ve had lots of compliments on this case . 
i bought this about a month ago and it works great . 
the other reviewers who described the noise as annoying are quite correct however . 
i had always used thin cut steak and marinated it for a day or two and then dehydrated . 
one other negative to is is the plastic housing .  .  . it shouldn t be dropped . 
the phone is crystal clear and sounds great . 
i don t need the extra room for more food ,  and you can t easily store leftovers while camping . 
 how many times ,  it s too early to tell .  i burned the popcorn the first time ,  but knew this was likely . 
it is so nice to smoothly slide it out where it s off the floor and closer to the counter . 
this item does need extra cleaning care because it does dirty quickly . 
so far ,  this one has done great on everything from hard crust breads to turkeys and hams . 
cut off a piece of saran wrap about the size of the wax square . 
no mess to create food deposits and stain plus no clean up of the mess . 
i still cut meat on my regular board . 
i can t get it loud enough to hear when used with the iphone . 
i use the larger container for cotton swabs and it holds a large amount . 
if you want to keep the pan looking pretty ,  hand wash it . 
i purchased this to use in a thunderbolt while i waited about num_num months for my upgrade . 
i am using this to keep my garmin nuvi num_num powered up while driving . 
i can get two full charges on an iphone num_extend
this tray was just what i was looking for . 
this is the first thing i reach for when i need to mix ,  puree ,  whip ,  or chop something . 
i will update the review again after some battery use . 
i love the ngp ,  the tactile feel of the whole case is great . 
as soon as i notified amazon of the return ,  they shipped a replacement back out to me . 
but ,  it looks great on my iphone num_extend  :   . 
if you guide the cutter with your free hand it does most of the peel . 
she is happy that is all that matters . 
but ,  use a larger diameter pot ,  and it will eliminate it . 
it s sharper ,  holds an edge longer and just plain grates better than any grater ever made . 
jars; noodles ,  instant potatoes ,  flour ,  sugar ,  etc .  ,  in half gallon jars . 
i highly recommend buying them ,  and hand washing once used . 
i always have to manually connect the dish hopper to make it work properly . 
engraved markings to use with the right food group . 
i received a good quality product num_extend an num_extend time around . 
i got thease for my mom so she s not stuck useing the big one all the time . 
just use the top two and the large hole with three fingers and it works great . 
hope my chef husband doesn t permanently borrow it . 
i like that it came in a package of ten with a great price !  . 
the coffee was anemic and the steamer didn t quite cut it . 
this are just as represented and very high quality so would highly recommend . 
we use them in the winter to cut down static in the house ,  as well as for colds . 
it s just so easy !  if you re a tea person ,  this pot is definitely for you . 
roll into num_num balls and press with tortilla press . 
i ve had this rice cooker for more than num_extend and use it to cook rice every single day . 
 ac  status means the charging is at full charging rate . 
i had to move it because of wiper hitting it . 
unlike metal it isn t going to get hot . 
its a nice novelty item if you remember to use it . 
we have used these knives for several months and i cannot tell you how please we are with them . 
if you re reading this seller ,  let me know if you want your duplicate back .   . 
trying to access teh volume buttons on the side through the armband case was a little difficult . 
my samsung is fussy on the type of cable used to communicate to my computer . 
you can have chopped onions in about four different sizes ,  depending on how much pulse chopping you do . 
i use this on the beach and in the shower to listen to music or my pod casts . 
of course it makes it much thicker but the other dimensions are roughly left the same . 
the top one  clean water  is not easy for me to make work . 
works really good on sliced roasts to make chicken fried steak ,  etc . 
i only have corelle dishes and like them as they are lightweight not bulky and fit well in cupboard . 
you will be amazed and how your little guy springs back to life . 
if you can keep it together then it works well . 
so good for me who gets pretty hot without air conditioning . 
but once i got it ,  i love it . 
just start off at a fairly medium heat . 
i love this handset and use it for lengthy conversations . 
i had to order the cable for several dollars plus shipping ,  and it took two weeks for delivery . 
i have really used it and keep asking myself over and over; why didn t you buy one before now ?  . 
i noticed this model got rave reviews ,  so i bought it . 
the reviews were very good and that helped me decide to buy this brand . 
however ,  it serves as a good way to scan through documents ,  accurately select apps ,  etc . 
it s a hard case with screen protector and silicone wrap . 
this is the smaller version but it easily provides a great companion to pandora . 
i wish these things would quit within the num_num days amazon allows as amazon has a great return policy . 
it slices through nectarines and cherries like butter ,  and lemons like it s . 
have them nicely displayed for everyone to see . 
i had my old one for about num_num years and couldn t remember where i had bought it . 
i decided to take the chance and i am so glad i did . 
this is a very nice vac to get . 
and no dangling cord all over  ! worth every cent and then more !  . 
these table cloth clamps are superior to many i have tried . 
the wood handle is great as it won t conduct the heat from the cooking oil . 
why argue with success ?  i make waffles every week and they are perfect every time . 
not much more you can say about stickers . 
also really great to use on pans instead of store bought aerosols . 
i ran it while showering at num_extend a . m . 
so i may purchase a separate pot for that . 
but ,  here it is for $ it work ?  absolutely . 
every time ,  on the first pass around the rim ,  it opens the can . 
it stays in and on my ear ,  num_extend
i love my foodsaver system ,  it makes a huge difference . 
for my galaxy nexus ,  it lasts approximately two and a half charges for one full charge of the device . 
if you are looking for an everyday case then this is probably overkill . 
i have to  rinse sweep with just hot water today as directed . 
the cutouts are precisely placed and the combination of silicone and the hard shell provides good protection . 
its better than the others that i have used . 
although my ear is not keen on the idea of music that close to my ear . 
i d recommend it to anyone with the evo shift . 
i bought this stick blender to make cold process soap . 
i did use parchment paper in it so it stayed clean . 
i am an avid cookie baker and i finallly invested in silpat . 
i had been looking for a flexible spatula ,  but they are hard to find . 
i bought one for my sister ,  and she loves hers as well . 
old style charge port is the only drag on this thing ,  but that is not that big of deal . 
i ve had a several variations on the small george foreman grills . 
next time i make it ,  im going to put some basil and tomato in it . 
the side and top buttons are more than usable . 
seems to conduct heat quite well so foods cook evenly . 
too bad they don t make these in the usa any more though . 
replaced a much more expensive otter cover and have been quite satisfied . 
i ve used them only once so far and the results were great . 
and ,  i must say ,  this is the best juicer that we have ever owned . 
i am giving it num_num stars because it does a great job toasting toast ,  bagels ,  and pop tarts . 
only drawback is i don t like the volume control . 
maybe this due he cooks more than i due . 
this is my first time using a coffee press and decided to go with the stainless bodum . 
i bought this coffeemaker despite some of the negative reviews listed here . 
this is a great plastic case that fits just right and looks great with the iphone . 
it s a bit of a pain that it s not dishwasher safe . 
this case provides protection at a minimal cost ,  fits well and does the job !  . 
my only issue is because of space we have to store them and they get tangled and irritating . 
as for the armband ,  this is what is great about the product . 
it has a removable lid ,  which is wide enough to be able to empty and fill easily . 
no fingerprints  in case you were wondering  ,  and they are versatile . 
not a huge pitcher and it uses the standard brita filter design . 
the maintenance is super easy and i am saving so much money by not buying coffee everyday . 
i think the whole kit cost like $ shipping included . 
it s better looking and more ergonomic than it appears in the photographs . 
i can charge both my ipad and iphone num_num a couple of times with leftovers . 
of course i have a brita filter jug in my refrigerator so i buy these all the time . 
the application is certainly easier than the zagg ,  which requires you wet multiple surfaces and squeegee . 
i have only had this machine one week ,  but so far it is making a great espresso . 
i do not need or want a huge screen . 
this has worked out great as a back up battery for my htc evo . 
i can t drink regular coffee as i get acid stomach . 
so i bought this salter and i ve found that i really like this little scale . 
i have plenty of open slots for additional devices . 
i found mine for $ with shipping at $ making a total of only $ out of new york . 
it is an excellent cheap solution for a phone that needs protection . 
i have an num_extend and my husband had a samsung galaxy . 
never baked a cake in this kind of pan before . 
i would recommend them for being handy and easy to use . 
installation is easy but i used my own fasteners instead of the one provided . 
i paid $ and got free shipping right before christmas . 
the comments about the taste of perked versis drip was interesting and i decided to try a percolator . 
dealing with a mess when it happens as opposed to waiting to rent a machine is the key . 
first off ,  i love the feel of it . 
i use mine quite frequently ,  and makes quick work of dicing onions and peppers for philly steaks or burgers . 
these make my phone feel like it does not have one on at all . 
i can use this to cook stews ,  soups . 
i can t believe how beautifully it has worked for me . 
i have also used it a few times for cutting dough . 
whowants to stop and shop for vacumn cleanerbags ?  it s a very portable model with greatflexability . 
like they are trying way too hard to be futuristic . 
the large side pocket holds the kitchen aid book and the edge beater with ease . 
particularly given how many tasks these can be put to throughout the home . 
amazing and the smallness of it is just fine for all sorts of meats . 
in spite of that ,  we immediately replaced it with the exact same product . 
the design is visible through the case ,  and the case protects the phone . 
these cast iron skillets are the cat s meow . 
it works great on my gas stove top ,  at a lower heat . 
i got the sunflower and plan to use it as a plater . 
i have now retired the roasters i have used for years ,  this is better . 
as air periodically enters the tank when water evaporates it makes a quite disturbing sound . 
at its maximum of num_num degrees indicated ,  the waring pro warmed the oil to num_num degrees . 
german quality and craftsmanship are second to none . 
this one is sharper ,  cuts better and is of a smaller ,  more manageable size . 
i cannot wait to be able to use it to its full capabilities . 
they will not charge in the phone ,  only on the provided charger . 
and a templete on where the screws go . 
no more charcoal ,  lighter ,  waiting ,  refilling propane ,  etc .  ,  etc . 
i bought num_num and plan to gift two . 
i love it . the wood is also high quality and gorgeous . 
i m happy i ordered it ,  works just fine , and easy to use . would recommend it to everyone . thank you ,  mary lou . 
it is great for soups ,  deep frying ,  baking potatoes ,  etc . 
i was thrilled with my dutch oven ,  and now i am thrilled with my skillet as well . 
the buds fit comfortably in my ears without the extra attachments included in the package . 
we have had ours over a year and still going strong . 
i like the set and would recommand them to others . 
it has a rather sharp edge which makes unsticking things from the pan neat and easy . 
i am an overwhelmed mother of num_num teens and one big german husband . 
the wood always ends up dry and cracked . 
if you have any concerns about buying a phonedevil product do not . 
no more dirtying a spoon to stir up limeade or tea with sediment . 
what i don t like is having a tangled mess of cords to sift through . 
the wod will seem to occur after you disconnect after a file transfer . 
but ,  it was way more money than i wanted to spend so i searched amazon . 
the shiny surface of the case also makes it easier to wipe clean and the color is super cute . 
have always wanted to try a french press . 
i use this item with my samsung fascinate . 
it is pricey ,  but for me ,  it s worth every penny . 
was perfect for my brother who has a small kitchen and limited space . 
it arrived pretty fast and it was in good condition . 
what you get is strong espresso that isn t bitter like what you get when you use a french press . 
the lodge brand is reliable and usa made !  . 
i just dont like the fact that the edges are not smooth; at some point my pinky started hurting . 
i have the artisan model kitchenaid ,  and it fits perfectly . 
i love the phone ,  its light and has good functionality . 
i wear glasses and i think that s most of the issue there . 
they generally cost a little more ,  but they are usually well worth the money . 
i have had a couple of these mugs for several years and love them . 
i took it camping and my eagle scout friend used it to make fantastic campfire meals . 
but if you just want to buy one ,  get this one . 
good thing i didn t ,  because the reviews on the washer problems were interesting . 
the next day and the battery is still showing % left . 
and the sauce came out great as well !  cleanup was a snap with just soap and a nylon brush . 
if you have a tendency to lose them ,  order more . 
we need it every now and then ,  but don t want things living in it . 
i like the look and feel of this product and it protects it nicely . 
some place settings have shallow bowls that are not good for soup ,  and these are deep and wide . 
it s not cheap ,  but either is what you get for your money . 
it s protected ,  makes me not really worry about my phone . 
i set it before bed and our house smells like fresh baked bread in the morning . 
this makes it very hard to cut all day . 
they are great to cut on as they seem to hold up well . 
no need for a constant parade of butter knives . 
i ve used these cutters all of one time and i already love them . 
if you buy your kids any type of smart phone ,  make sure you buy them a screen protector . 
the actual bowl ,  and it s lid can be run through the dishwasher ,  no problem . 
my kitchen appliances are red so this was perfect for my kitchen . 
i like my coffee hot and this old fashion coffee pot does that . 
even the drive belt and hepa filters are supposed to be changed by a service center . 
my iphone i only use to receive calls . 
this was delivered today and is at a good price . 
a longer headphone cable lets you attach the headset to your sleeve or shirt tail . 
my only disappointment was that it wasn t long enuf to kinda touch each side of the back . 
i bought this set to replace a henckels set i bought three years ago . 
i have never had anyone complain about the sound quality of my voice . 
i ve been cooking more at home recently and decided to try a better quality pan . 
i bought it to replace the original non touchstone cover which was falling apart . 
i use different colors to separate all the phones in the family . 
basic bluetooth speaker for the visor in the car . 
it offers num_num angles to choose from  portrait design  . 
earpieces are very unique to the individual using them . 
i have been using it for a year ,  although rarely ,  and it works just fine . 
i haven t used all the setting and stuff yet ,  but i am very glad i fond this !  . 
as was said this thing is huge and you might have a hard time finding someplace to store it . 
have tiny  stuff  to dehydrate ,  use a screen tray . 
it s perfect for one to two people as it only makes num_extend
i don t see myself changing phones anytime soon as the num_num seems to have everything i need for now . 
i needed a dish soap dispenser for the kitchen and wanted to get one in stainless . 
i research a bunch before deciding on this set and i couldn t be happier with them . 
i wanted to protect my screen without making it darker or having it feel yucky . 
it s probably more like num_extend stars ,  but amazon doesn t allow that . 
when applying the film ,  use a lot of the spray . 
all my mac eyeshadow fits in each one . 
they clean up in a snap in hot sudsy water . 
there is a large threaded shaft coming up from the motor in the middle . 
if you can live with the looks ,  it s a super deal . 
my youngest daughter keeps begging me to use it to listen to her music on her ipod . 
holds a charge nicely and thus far have had no noticeable problems with the item . 
this review will serve to echo the many that came before it .  .  . this is a good one !  . 
i also use it when i m using speakerphone or playing music so that the speakers aren t muffled . 
it was a nice experience that didn t involve having to return item or any dissatisfaction . 
my wife accidentally knocked her bodum french press off the counter while on vacation . 
i use this item to carry some basic tools and supplies on the job . 
you can t beat the price for such high quality . 
other than that ,  this thing is indispensable to my life . 
these are amazing stands ,  especially for the super low price . 
all in all ,  i believe that this is one of the best purchases i ve made on amazon . 
and it got here fast . i ve been using an num_extend in the car . 
i wish they would come out with a two stick holding capacity version . 
it also comes with a steamer basket and steel trivet ,  both of which i ve yet to use . 
i bought this for my wife based on the price . 
this product is still working a couple years later . 
it holds less than your average num_extend pan as the sides are sloped and the sides are . 
also tired of hunting for my scissors and can opener in drawers . 
i say perhaps too good because it pairs with my phone from a long distance ,  say num_num ft . 
it was highly recommended by the pioneer woman as one of her favorite utensils . 
heavy duty and non stick just like my full size chicago metallic cookware that i love . 
it s about the size of a small skinny cell phone and looks nice . 
i am so glad that this has a good price . 
they came out perfect . i cleaned the yellow remains with a paper towel . 
you also need a pastry brush to remove the last bits of grounds . 
you should still have a functioning lcd to use this . 
i ve used the num_num for years to great success . 
looks great at night and does exactly what it is supposed to do . 
the bold is what it says it is :  bright ,  clear ,  vivid . 
this rechargeable charger has a nice sleek design and is very light and compact . 
used it for num_num years and had no issues at all . this is very light and it is very reliable . 
the product is very good quality ,  i recommend it %
my cat never has reimbursed me for breaking the carafe . 
this is going to be the best cookie jar ever . 
acutally this cooker can double as a steamer also . 
i m never out of juice and i carry a spare with me . 
worry that these could become misshapen in the dishwasher even if using top shelf . 
i ve had my cast iron chicken fryer for years . 
it s large so it can cook a lot at once which saves time . 
so i decided to purchase this wok for my own . 
all the pieces seem sturdy and well made . 
also they don t mind a little moisture so you are unlikely to steam your fingers . 
every phone should have and anti glare screen protector on them ,  always . 
first ,  i drizzle a little evo in the bottom and turn on the gas . 
i bought this to clean the traffic areas of only two rooms . 
amco also makes a green one for lime that is smaller . 
my older lg phone connects automatically as i approach the house . 
the points are short and you do have to use some common sense when using it . 
this whisk is great because it is soft on the hand and doesn t require much pressure to control it . 
probably more power than a home cook needs .  .  . but awesome . 
the deep side pocket is great for storing the other attachments . 
this performs just as well as my decades old and entirely smooth old num_num inch skillet . 
took a little while to come but was worth the wait . 
i just love this mixer and i love kitchenaid products . 
you have got to love  lifetime warranty  on any product . 
one of the many reasons your current can opener sucks a left nut is because it s not stainless steel . 
i know this because i tried baking cookies on it . 
would recommend getting the ben and jerry s book to go along with it . 
much better control over the audio than the included real player  which only plays num_extend not internet num_extend
much ,  much faster than my older one too . 
glad there is so many different ear buds to choose from . 
i did the research so i knew what to expect and it hasn t disappointed . 
also can use photoshop express  also free  to tweak the photo prior to num_extend
the temps have to be perfect at this vacation spot . 
i use this dish very regularly for sunday nachos !  !  . 
get lots of compliments on it !  lots of color with some sparkle . 
am pleased that i can just replace the brush head portion on this . 
i use this for tough cuts of meat that need to be tenderized for a quick sear . 
i installed this screen protector on both sides of my iphone num_extend
it is a bit slippery though he claims but overall he is pleased . 
other reviewers must have set it for  raisin  bread when they didnt mean to . 
it s great for bacon ,  corn bread ,  home made tortillas ,  and so many other things . 
you could  and i have  use it as a little baby canner for a small load of small jars . 
i also bought a roomba for my daughter in law and my daughter . 
now serving lasagna is easy from the very first piece . 
only wish it would go a little farther between refills . 
i like how it protects iphone from getting scatched . 
as i am the primary dishwasher in our family ,  this last fact is extremely important to me . 
would be great in a retro kitchen or diner . 
needed to protect my wife s iphone and settled on this case after serious research . 
i bought this as a gift for my husband . 
then my eureka finally died and i decided to try this one . 
i like that it retracts and stays right at the length that you want it to . 
i have received many compliments on this phone . 
it has so many uses you will wonder how you got along without it .  .  . may order a couple more . 
unsure if it s just this one case or what . 
i would suggest this case to anyone wanting extended battery life . 
also ,  with the hoover s the belt kept breaking or streatching . 
in addition ,  my carpet now has carpet blades  i don t know what you call them  pulled up randomly . 
without the unit i had no data connection for my droid phone . 
as mentioned ,  the voyager pro+ is also a lot more comfortable for wearing long periods at a time . 
about two months ago ,  i was attempting to mince some garlic and the press broke into pieces . 
have an electric drip machine at my other home ,  but this one gives the best results . 
it s size is what is expected for a num_extend charger . 
i have many of these warren kimble cat pieces and this one fits in well . 
i bought num_num of these to sit on the middle shelf of one of my cabinets . 
i did use olive oil around the rim of the seal . 
portable power supply .  .  . i didn t really know that i needed one ,  until i actually got one . 
i love it !  great for cooking things you love to eat . 
after num_num hours of preparation and cooking ,  you hate to see your masterpiece destroyed at the critical moment . 
i am very satisfied with the phone and look forward to at least another four years with it . 
if you don t have one ,  get it now . 
i d really recommend at least two of these for anyone who packs a lunch . 
you will enjoy the purchase if you have an num_extend
adapter plug fits where earplugs would normally go . 
oh well ,  at least i gave the other copy to my sister . 
once you step up to coffee makers over fifty dollars ,  you might ask why you re paying more . 
brought me here to see the price and wow i got a deal . 
it is the best case to have in my opinion . 
with skim milk you can get a very thin layer of foam that dissipates quickly . 
if i m going to consume something i want it to be satisfying in more ways than one . 
in spite of moving ,  this baby is still holding strong . 
comes in handy since i like using a wall charger over my usb connecter to charge my phone . 
if there are long streaky liquid stains or really heavy soiling on products ,  it may need some extra help . 
not as big as it seems in the pictures . 
this filterstream model is the best i ve ever used . 
they are small ,  and fit my ear very well . 
i just used this for the first time tonight . 
two arrow buttons provide easy  speed up  and  slow down  control . 
in addition ,  it has nice voice prompts letting me know how much talk time is left and such . 
i didn t want to cover up the beauty that is the iphone s design so this was the best option . 
everything comes apart logically ,  and all seven items rinse clean under simple running tap water and mild soap . 
this spatula ,  unlike the spoons ,  is just the right length . 
this book emphasizes very sweet dessert pops ,  however . 
no fighting a full bag being stuck in a trash can and trying to get it out . 
this package came with both metal and plastic ,  including a suction cup to lift the screen  . 
what a fun and easy way to make spaetzle . 
it s a great for pan roasted potatoes ,  and sauteed vegetables and greens . 
so yeah ,  maybe one day i ll actually use it for baking cake .  .  . at my work !  just kidding . 
i don t have to heat the bid oven to still have pizza in the summer . 
like the way this works ,  keeps the butter soft . 
it says made in mexico on it . it appears that oster was playing with how they make this jar base . 
the model isone of the finer pieces of kitchen cookware i ve ever used or owned . 
we love this scoop !  we use it to make perfectly rounded cookies and other great baked treats . 
i just can t emphasize how perfect they were . and then i got home and went to unload the dishwasher . 
only time will tell !  for now ,  i am satisfied . 
it wobbles a bit and i fear some day it may fall out of the fridge . 
i have been looking for this for a long time and finally thought to check amazon . com . 
this is a hard ,  smooth plastic case for the iphone num_extend
maybe i ll duct tape the hose and the one i use most to hold it . 
but the plantronic does a better job at connectivity then the samsung own bluetooth num_extend
but ,  since they are heavy steel ,  they are easy to scrub without damaging them . 
after one year of use i m still extremely happy with my purchase . 
i am very pleased with my purchase ! the best thing is there is no thin stem to break . 
great price point ,  right size ,  should have gotten more . 
thinner meats like chops or some steaks thawing will take about num_num minutes and naturally thicker ones take longer . 
i ve tossed these around quite a bit and they haven t scratched up yet . 
it gets my garden greens dried quickly and i really like that . 
keeps knives safely out of reach for small children and readily accessable while prepping food . 
when i don t hear anymore pops ,  it is ready . 
better in the case than sitting in apile on the counter next to the machine . 
i will update with my results after num_num year of use . 
this was an excellent choice ! i highly recommend getting a marble cutting board . 
these are very nice quality ,  very nice looking . 
the ice tray is easy to use ,  opens easily ,  and the cube size allows for quick freezing . 
at a price of num_num dollars you really can t go wrong . 
i tried the machine on a loaf of bread using the serrated blade that came with the machine . 
fits the curve nice and snug out of quality materials . 
the way everything is situated ,  my hand never blocks this from view and i am right handed . 
if you want to do any sort of cooking ,  these measuring cups are a must . 
make sure you don t wash it in the machine ,  we just did and it tore  our fault  . 
positively ,  sensational . the west bend has a nice clear dome to watch the excitement going on inside . 
love it and still use it ,  holding up well !  !  . 
can t add custom ringtones ,  limited to those noises that come with the num_extend
these screen guards are cheap ,  but they fit well and are easy to install . 
clean up is a snap with putting in dishwasher . 
most pizza pans now come with a nonstick surface for easy cleaning . 
it is not difficult to clean as i had expected it would be . 
it opens bottles with the greatest of ease . 
i can t tell you how much i am enjoying using it . 
i put the lids back on and put everything into place into the container and left shortly therearfter . 
i d guess that this case would outlast my phone . however ,  it s too big for my bb curve . 
i rounded the corners slightly to prevent gouging when i use it to scrape my wood cutting boards . 
i use a thick vinyl inner curtain and a heavy cotton outer curtain ,  without seemingly any additional stress . 
i finally purchased when the price was reduced . 
this crock is large enough to hold numerous utensils close to the stove for easy access . 
it is heavy ,  but is pretty maneuverable with the handles . 
i don t like to hand chop items in recipes ,  so this chopper was a big help . 
hop around too much and they will come off . 
i use these cutting boards alone and on top of my traditional wood cutting board . 
i got too lazy to get an exchange from amazon . 
the charger works just the same as the original iphone charger . 
i use the hose every time i vacuum ,  but i have had to replace it twice . 
this muffin pan has excellent weight and a super non stick coating . 
sadly ,  i dropped a few ,  but i still have most of them left . 
like another reviewer ,  i m always confident buying a vortex product . 
constantly changing the game and making the phone easier to use and more functional . 
that may change over time as the device breaks in . 
it may take a little  learning  to adjust you burners to the correct setting . 
i was able to make a meal for six adults in this one skillet . 
sound latency can be about num_extend seconds . overall works well with my samsung galaxy num_extend
even though this west bend only holds num_num eggs ,  i m happy with it . 
all the tools are included but you will need a hairdryer too . 
wusthof makes quality knives and i am very pleased with this set . 
i bought those when i got my elecreic rotato express just as i might need later . 
i ve been wearing it all day and it is light and very comfortable . 
i tried two  yes ,  two  batteries and had to send both back because both were crap . 
it also discolored after heating up certain foods ,  and became misshapen after getting too hot . 
years ago i used a neighbors hoover steam vac and was very impressed . 
of course ,  the return window expired last week . 
the result was firm ,  well textured ,  good flavored pasta . 
at a low price its awesome and unlocked . 
the packaging leaves a bit to be desired though ,  i had quite the struggle to get the box open . 
the good news is that otterbox will replace your case if it becomes damaged within one year of purchase . 
then again ,  there is a fair warning in product description ,  so all is above board . 
i use this for my iphone num_extend in the car . 
let s face it ,  this is the best camera phone ever . 
this product does its job and yet affordable . 
good that it tells you when the power is low . 
plus ,  the coffee stays fresh and hot in the thermal pot . 
i eat one portion fresh and have two more portions later . 
i believe as long as the plate is not over num_extend it will fit nicely . 
it s a safety feature that will prevent a motor from burning itself up . 
after cooking and cooling ,  i use a scraper and water to remove the food . 
i accidentally set a hot pan on it and it melted instantly . 
i ve bought several and i think it makes good coffee . 
it s nice how you can have it blowing two different directions at the same time . 
it s come down in price  at the time of this review ,  it s num_num dollars  ,  but it s still too expensive . 
i have been wanting this and couldn t find one . 
i leave the lid up overnight even after cleaning to let it air out . 
you get a mini usb and micro usb adapter . 
the ricer is simple yet well made ,  strong and reliable and produces evenly riced potatoes every time . 
sure enough ,  my phone detected it and was then paired . 
love our morning coffee and especially love it from a perc pot . 
i haven t used these on a grill outside yet ,  but i m sure these would be perfect for that . 
good for any replacement goes in very well and will work if done right . 
i bought several for each pants belt for the many changes i do each day . 
i like softer corn rather than crunchy corn . 
so ,  when i saw this one with the heavy base ,  i jumped at the chance to try it . 
i also have a barbecue set with some tongs that are so large as to be nearly useless . 
i like the zipper on the side for easy access . 
i love the way it looks when my coffee is sitting there ready to go . 
also ,  fits really good and looks nice from the inside of the room . 
if you want to use it fry eggs ,  then try what i do . 
the cookies turn out perfectly and are uniform size . 
this is wider than the num_num quart chef s pan and is not designed for a lid . 
i love this dutch oven !  i just love cast iron period . 
since then i ve had several both brand names and brand x chargers . 
she loved it and she loves how smooth it feels . 
this one works just like the original used to work . 
though it shows num_extend the two batteries i received were num_extend
a headset like this is mandatory for me . i ve used other headsets before . 
finally a place to put my pasta to dry . 
i was tempted to get the $ num_num mah package instead but this one is worth the extra price . 
she swears they are even better than parchment paper and are reusable many times over . 
other than that very pleased with quality ,  durability and design . 
it made a perfect hole for the headphone ,  microphone and num_num punches for the ir lense . 
i recommend illy moka arabica coffee to go with it . 
it works extremely well and i have not had a single leak . 
fits all my different size pots and steams everything from broccoli to corn on the cob . 
most of the ones i ordered claimed to be antiglare and weren t . applying the screen protecter was easy . 
plenty longer if i gave the poor thing any rest . 
or heat it up by he cup in the microwave . 
the air quality in my apt has improved dramtically . 
this usb charger is just what i needed . 
i immediately started using one and left the other in the package . 
i have not tried to put them in the freezer . 
after almost two years of heavy use it still works as goodas the day we bought it . 
i ve already had a couple spills ,  but i knew this before buying it . 
the settings on either the fettucini or spaghetti attachements will decide the thickness and overall apperance of your pasta . 
the phone recognize it as a regular charger . 
doesn t seem to have any vibration noise issues ,  either ,  and it s sitting on a hard wood floor . 
this item came quickly and after about a week of breaking in it fits like a glove . 
their flat bottoms work fine on my smoothtop stove . 
the racy red color and design are exactly what i was expecting . 
very handy for all handles that may get hot . 
this makes the ole garlic squish a breeze . 
on the fence about whether to buy it or not because of the  worthless piece of trash  review . 
this is just the right size for me since i live in a small apartment and by myself . 
sound is pretty good especially if you can find a corner to place it in . 
i have seen none of the lag problems that people complain about . 
this presto is affordable ,  simple ,  accurate and just easy to get along with . 
it can easily fit a large can of soup . 
wusthof proudly stamps the which metal their knives are made of right on the blade . 
there s a reason this is the brand that comes to mind for mixers . 
a few don ts :  don t buy if you are lazy about dismantling for thorough cleaning . 
many other headsets these days require you to hold a button down ,  which is not always a precise num_extend
i also plan to use the left overs for christmas baked gifts . 
i have some cast iron that doesn t and they are not used nearly as because of this feature . 
i have read many reviews on those and it seems the phones sometimes falls out of the clip . 
it was worth the price of this product . 
this one also has handles to make it easy to carry . 
i ve seen the rubber covers and they just don t seem to look nice or last long . 
takes a bit to learn how to use this but for baking it cannot be beat . 
the aerolatte website claims the motor is guaranteed for num_num years . 
however ,  i chip the lid and having trouble finding a replacement . 
they hold standby charge a long time as well . 
i watched a few youtube videos on juicing and learned a lot . 
 it does not clear the overhanging cabinetry ,  i think the new cord was under two feet  . 
it is identical to our original whip and the picture of the whip looks identical to what i received . 
simple ,  cheap ,  works great and exactly what you need for hands free use . 
i know it s just a car charger ,  but i love the blue light . 
greatly extends the battery life ,  exactly as planned . 
however ,  there is no way to turn off this feature . 
i really like this wok and use it several times a week . 
i normally stick to htc products but motorola is really pulling through . 
i mainly use it to make soups and stews ,  and occassionally pasta . 
the cleaning attachment on this one is very helpful . 
the pan heats evenly ,  no hot or cold spots . 
my walls are hollow ,  so i wasn t sure the screws would stay in ,  even with anchors . 
it takes a little bit more effort than an automatic coffee maker ,  but not much . 
the actual packaging was a little damaged ,  but the item was good . 
the edges are rubbery and gross . i always followed the directions . 
do not ever buy another coffee pot when these stainless are on the market . 
the leather has a very soft touch and professional look . 
when i asked if i could test it ,  they brought over a wood block ,  a potato ,  and a tomato . 
loved the fact that i can use these on my touchscreen phone and tablet to make using easier . 
it is stable when mixing and easy to clean . 
even on an electric oven it still gets hot enough to wok . 
i frequently make large pots of soups and sauce and they are perfect for this job . 
i gave this cartridge four stars mostly because i think it s too expensive . 
no problems there . the popcorn always pops full and crisp and doesn t burn . 
i especially love the foot designed to keep it off the bottom of the pan . 
they came exactly as described and they work great . 
the outcome is a very sharp blade and one that slices anything with ease . 
this means that it has a pretty decent nonstick finish these days . 
knowing how kids are i knew i had to protect it or it would not last one week . 
this looks great and carries a decent number if bottles compared to others of similar size . 
i knew i needed a case for this phone and during the num_extend i found this case . 
btw ,  its cheaper at those two places than online . 
this steamer is good for dim sum ,  veggies and whatever you want to reheat by steaming . 
once you ve gotten the bowl out ,  let the head down into the locked position . 
they tell you not to do this ,  but i use it for dairy :  it keeps milk cold for hours . 
jabra all has bad reviews and i tried a plantronics one and returned it . 
this is a heavy duty glass ,  i mean heavy duty . 
i liked it well enough that i ordered a second one . 
you can get the generic version of this for $ by driving to your local target . 
i m actually storing athletic socks in it on a shelf in my closet ,  and it works great . 
as with any oil it must be applied every so often to keep the wood protected . 
if you need a steamer this is definitely a good buy . 
plus other people think they are very cool . 
highly recommended for anyone who enjoys quality tools and lots of garlic !  . 
i did this because i had read where others had problems with the seal leaking . 
it s not perfect and it won t replace your regular vacuum cleaner . 
but i wished it came with a medium sized knife for cutting vegetables . 
these dutch ovens are perfect and you cannot beat the price . 
i ve used it to make rice or ramen . 
it appears to be chip resistant ,  and given the weight it is not going to easily knock over . 
i love the depth of this bowl for snacks and for big servings of a stew or pasta . 
very happy !  !  lot cheaper than verizon store that s for sure . 
version with warranty  silver   ,  as most bluetooth headsets are . 
this is super easy to install and is like a brand new battery . 
i also purchased the amish country popcorn and every kernel popped . 
i like that this is not the aluminum version that galvanizes and rubs off in your food . 
no sharp edges on the can lids ,  no lids falling into your food ,  and no strain on your hands . 
it s exactly what i neededyou can t go wrong for the priice . 
whatever i thought i knew and liked about mashed potatoes was wrong . 
i ve also used it for baking pies ,  cookies ,  and a few other dishes and i really love it . 
i think grills are just hard to clean by their nature . 
the picture looks like the upper part sticks out beyond the lower pan; but it does not . 
this makes the knife less expensive to manufacture ,  and means that the handle molding can be less precise . 
only problem is the slits aren t wide enough . 
everyday i find something new to love about my evo . 
the first time we made it we forgot the salt ,  but it still tasted great . 
i have no complaints and would recommend this purchase to anyone . 
she said the red is so vibrant and the mixer works great . 
i am impressed with the coffee made with this coffee maker . 
it s just the perfect size for a single can of progresso soup or a can of chili . 
i have always loved glass pyrex measuring cups . 
i looked several places on line for a tea kettle . 
the all metal grater has many rough edges on the holder and on the lid to the storage compartment . 
on the top are the control panel and the yeast dispenser . 
i am very impressed with the oxo good grips cookie scoops . 
i will update this review again in a month or so you will know if it still works . 
hardwood or laminate cover my other floors  vinyl in bath and laundry  . 
i think everyone should have one of these in their home . 
i love these tools makes dipping chocolates so much easier and a whole lot less messier . 
oh ,  one note tho ,  it s not actually the shape of the one in the pic . 
arrived quickly ,  it is as good as an otterbox . 
there was plenty of dirty water in the recovery tank ,  which proves that it does suction . 
keys on the kindle work with these as well . 
i got this  contact grill  years ago and it is my panini maker . 
i did the work on a really clean ,  hard ,  flat surface which i thoroughly cleaned . 
great gift idea !  ready when you need it and fresh . 
very stupid you had to get this for a walkman phone . 
while still not the perfect toaster it is far superior to others that i have had . 
you an tell that the bowl is constructed more solidly . 
we are getting away from the plastic container ,  which stain ,  and melt in microwave . 
i like the concept of it and it works great for playing music in the car . 
i bought one for myself as well to take to my office . 
at $ i am going to order several more as  super economy sized  stocking stuffers !   : o  . 
the question we asked ourselves was how did we get along for so long without a salad spinner . 
one of the best ways to have a nice full flavored cup of coffee . easy to use ,  easy to clean . 
i called cuisinart and asked them to send me a new blade assembly . 
there can be some  issues  with the plastic cracking or separating . 
from the under $ variety to this one . spend a little more ,  get a quality product that will last . 
the blade is not sharp enough to cut tendon . 
bigger is always better . stainless clean up is easy . 
it features contemporary styling ,  ease of use ,  and is full featured . 
so he got me this as a replacement . 
this little thing has got some serious grinding skills . 
not sure what kind of bread they are using ,  but regular bread fits perfect . 
this corrected what i consider a design flaw in the motorola dock . 
its great that it comes with num_num stylus you can share with your friends and they look really cool . 
it is a heavier gauge than i expected ,  so it should hold up well . 
in a nutshell ,  that s the big plus for this . 
bought the white one for my artisan kitchenaid mixer . 
i bought one for num_extend and it worked so got one for my niece . 
she uses it for light floors with no heavy stuff like cat litter . 
complaints first :  it does take forever to heat and the handles do get hot . 
easy on and off and volume is great ,  i have not had anyone complain about the sound . 
what can one really say about a vacuum filter ?  it s a replacement and does the job . 
as far as storage goes ,  it is slightly bulkier than the pampered chef opener ,  but i ll happily make room . 
i bought this knife because of a recommendation in cook s illustrated magazine . 
you can pair up to num_num devices ,  and use num_num at a time . 
i love all farberwear pots and this did not disappoint . 
check it with your address to see coverage in your area prior to buying the phone . 
the thing probably will out last all of us . 
my wife and i use it daily ,  we ve had no problems ,  and are very happy with this purchase . 
i like that it ships in  amazon frustration free packaging  ,  which means no plastic clamshell packaging to fight through . recommended ! cfh . 
the voice prompts for various functions are clear ,  and the headset is simple to operate . 
i bought this for my nexus num_num after seeing many recommendations . 
i wish the little dished out place for removing the battery being charged were a bit deeper . 
the mophie juice pack never has let me down . 
on average i can charge my iphone num_extend four times  usually at around % battery life  . 
and are not expensive ,  do i don t need to take that much caution with them . 
the hanger keeps everything from getting wrinkled in a drawer . 
i use my oxo good grips salad spinner every day for the last num_num years or so . 
i did not think that oxo could do better and i am pleasantly surprised about the new set . 
both fans i keep on window ledges to pull in cool spring and fall air . 
also ,  you need to pretreat any old or bad stains first . 
they don t need greasing ,  just a little pam and they re good to go . 
however when you look at wusthof s website ,  these knives are still listed there . 
works great for crepes .  .  .  . at least my husband ,  the cook in the family says so . 
works great only thing is the way it is angled it is blocking the earphone port . 
i do feel obligated to say if you re looking for a cheap version of an otterbox ,  then keep looking . 
the recipes have a degree of creativity ,  but are all things that  real people  eat . happy cooking !  . 
our twin num_num year olds didn t even know what it was suppose to be . 
what i was looking for was a balloon whip for egg whites . 
i ve dropped my phone already ,  and it s nothing !  . 
about the only tough thing to use this wonderful headset is to take it off the package . 
it was much sturdier than i expected ,  and was easily to assemble . 
hannah from pretty little liars had this case so i had to get it  :   . 
using the helper handle also helps to ensure that you won t accidentally drop the skillet . 
i got these so we could have a smaller plate so smaller portions . 
i do a lot of mixing and pouring and regular funnels are too small to easily manage the task . 
i use these on a daily basis in a professional kitchen in lieu of a wooden spoon . 
i do a lot of physical activity for work ,  climbing crawling etc and this holster keeps phone secure . 
the solution ,  was to purchase a quality bundt pan with excellent heat conduction . 
i have a small set of ears ,  and the default is perfect . 
i have owned the vitamix super num_num since num_extend and i love it . 
there is tons of space on this thing and its a very well made product . 
i looked at many different cases online before i decided on this one . 
i use it every day for measuring out our german shepherd s two cup a meal kibble . 
this num_num clears the air and i wake up without congestion and i sleep much better . 
this has made my making bread dough very easy . 
they do catch large particles well ,  and are an integral part of my holmes filter . 
the sphero is entertaining for anyone of any age . 
took about num_num seconds to wiggle it out . 
and since they re metal they shouldn t break like some of my plastic ones have . 
they are fabulous to use ,  easy to wash and look so shiny !  we love them . 
i have tried them all and the mcgowen is the best . 
the ones on the edge don t impede on performance . 
no problems with it and i am very happy with this battery . 
seriously the absolute best steak knife either of us have ever used and we ve tried many . 
we chose to get the same item again because the first one was so good . 
the category cards are best combined with the weatherbee tabbed recipe card dividers ,  set of num_extend
the end that plugs into the iphone fits nicely also  both the num_num and num_extend
i love this case ,  my family has num_num iphones and i have this case on all of them . 
it also does not open and allow easy cleaning . 
i actually replaced a total of num_num iphone batteries ,  which were over num_num years old . 
i highly recommend both the tiny one here and it s big brother . 
then i turn the whole pan upside down . 
the fidelity is on par or better than plugging directly into the phone with my wired headsets . 
it is not easy to remove from the phone . 
edges aren t too sharp ,  as long as it doesn t get bunched up it s num_extend
that totals at least six hours of hot coffee . 
we bought this bowl after my husband kept using my nice stainless measuring cups on the grill . 
i have to clean at least once a num_extend
however ,  i woke up this morning to great coffee . 
aluminum is tried and tested and provides professional results . 
factory match to the cord that came with the phone . 
it is very light weight ,  sits securely on my ear and can be worn for long periods of time . 
but the caveat is that it doesn t cover the hardware volume and power buttons . 
whips eggs up beautifully and love how it mixes corn bread batter . 
this model is so much easier to use and a whole lot easier to clean . 
as long as you are not expecting crystal clear strong booster ability ,  one should be happy with the product . 
the emerson head bluetooth headset was giving to my son and he love it . 
some of my birkenstocks fit ,  but are crammed together ,  but regular shoes fit with no problem . 
i bought two sets of these for my daughters . 
they work fantastic ,  and easy to clean off ,  plus they don t leave a sticky residue when i remove it . 
the price was great too !  ! i know that i will be healthier because i am now cooking with stainless steel !  !  !  . 
firdt the cons  .  .  . proably the most annoying is that occassionally  ,  the data connection won t engage when it should . 
kept my phone scratch free very excited that i bought thesescreen protectors would have not done with out thanks . 
i ditched this case ,  because it is so annoying to take the phone out and put it back in . 
fall off because the food on it weighs more than the pan can handle . 
it can be used for storage and as a marinator . 
now i can get rid of my landline and start saving some money . 
they feel substantial in the hand and i think they ll last a good long time . 
boooo samsung !  % of the things you make dont last . 
i have tried storing them with weight on them but to no avail . 
i love being able to actually see it charging . 
the price isn t low ,  but you get what you pay for . 
typical of any amazon supplier ,  i received mine in short order . 
i ll have to let you know about the ease of that . thanks to the craftsperson who made them !  . 
the vacuum worked better than any vacuum we ve ever owned . 
i got num_num different sunbeam stand mixers before i gave up . 
i love these they make the screen look so much better . 
works great has two sizes one on each end and does not break the bank . 
i bought this for my newly remodeled kitchen . 
it is the ideal resting place for your palm pre num_extend
i hated to give seidio any more money since they didn t stand behind their product . 
the motorola power adapter charges my droid with the num_extend battery in num_num min . 
it s inexpensive compared to some models offered and it works great . 
but i could not live without one ,  so i got a replacement . i fill mine with olive oil . 
it makes it easier for me to get those dreaded tasks accomplished more num_extend
nice stainless finish and swivel base is convenient . 
the only downside is that the handle gets a bit warm when heating . 
there is nothing better !  !  and this coffee pot is simply wonderful . 
i go for the  contoured  pans when i m making rum cakes ,  and this one is aces . 
i bought it for less than $ and gave it a try . 
haven t used num_num in years ,  but with new state laws needed something when renting a car for biz trips . 
i read all of the reviews on on amazon just to get an idea of what to expect . 
all this being said i am not rating this headset based on the docs . 
sound quality ,  both incoming and outgoing is very good . 
no num_num inch lid available that i can find . 
really works nice as a flat pan for things like french toast ,  grilled sandwiches ,  etc . 
the reason is because it is spring loaded to gently force the speaking sensor next to your face . 
a really nice final feature is the swiveling base . 
a+ for simplicity and nice touch on the little status button that tells you how much juice is left . 
it was easy to use and easy to clean . 
very solid construction and will have for a very long time . 
i live in the los angeles area where the tap water is hard and horrible . 
i have asthma and severe environmental allergies to environmental allergens like pollen and dust mites . 
she recommends for game use since finger taps sometimes not recognized . 
the colors and the butterflies ,  and the cute story all were a hit . 
there are several tips i can offer when making ice cream . 
i just wanted a cheap stand for my galaxy num_extend
they are the best i have used so far . 
verizon clearly wants you to go to their getitnow service to purchase the latest and flashiest ringtones . 
if you must get only one pressure canner get this one . 
however ,  it was more complicated than i hoped it would be ,  hence four rather than five num_extend
another plus ,  it will last forever if you follow a few simple rules . 
it is a very simple thing to use and there is very little effort required in turning the grinder . 
i reread the instructions and found the problem . 
this is a great bumper despite being so cheap . 
nothing stick to it ,  and i am sure it can bake corn ,  banana ,  fruit breads ,  etc .  ,  all day long . 
making my own hummus has probably paid for the machine by now . 
if using a frozen product ,  follow the temp directions on the package . 
it did not come bent and stuck to the phone well . 
they are all inexpensive but nothing quite like the feel of a nice quality thick stainless steel part . 
but i had the case for about a year so it does last a while . 
after you try it once you will know this . 
the only thing i noticed is that the screen protector holds dents and marks . 
after purchasing the first one ,  i have ordered several more to store all my platters . 
my grandson wanted the hub for his his playstation num_num slim ,  which sees a lot of use . 
i have a full beard ,  and my wife says it almost blends in . 
good style ,  high quality ,  dishwasher safe knife that keeps its sharpness use after use . 
i s a great choice and a great value !  . 
i was looking for a case for my iphone num_num that my belt would slip through . 
i bought this because i now have children to decorate birthday cakes for . 
the revere num_num could easily become a useful family heirloom . 
you must do this if you buy gourmet kernels that are small and lightweight . 
use the touch screen with out fear of the phone moving under your fingers . 
the plastic lid occasionally pops up but no biggie . 
i like the storage tin ,  which i also used as a cutter . 
with the mushroom shaped foam pad ,  it s enough to simply rest it against the opening . 
then i used same to power a usb fan to cool my notebook . 
needed to use a bowl for a double boiler and wasn t happy with the glass ones . 
remove veggies ,  wipe clean then make my sauce . 
i use the medium scoop for keeping my meatballs uniform in size . 
the handle is long and well balanced and hasn t ever gotten too hot to handle . 
the magnet closure is secure but still easy to open . 
these screen protectors are always hit or miss . 
the sound is far better than i expected . 
like num_num elastic loops . thank you band it dishwasher loop . 
when you buy your dutch oven ,  buy the lid lifter . 
what can i say ,  it s everything they claim and more . 
a little tinny sounding but very light weight and loud enough to carry in my backpack on the bicycle . 
some may like having it flex a bit but not me . 
at $ it was less than half the price of the cast aluminum one sold by the range manufacturer . 
it s durable and adjust to any head size  i . e . 
i don t like the bun toaster part though . 
since i retired i have started doing a lot of cooking and these are absolutely great . 
the case has what seems be a silicone inner core covered my a hard plastic shell . 
my friends think it s the best of the higher end units they ve had and tried . 
i wanted to try a meat knife instead of a bread knife while doing my bbq competition . 
seidio s battery fits the seidio case like a glove . 
after about a week you will notice little burrs showing up on the knive edge . 
it looks like the screen is rough and not smooth . 
if you purchase online you absolutely have no idea what you are getting . 
i have to say it is more like a  life tool  . 
purchased this for my wife ,  but i have also utilized it on several occasions . 
this bottle opener has opened several hundred bottles and works perfectly every time . 
if you re considering splurging on this for yourself or a gift ,  i highly recommend it . 
i do believe this is an actual num_num watt supply !  will be buying more !  . 
no problem ,  no hassle ,  as it should be ,  at your convenience . 
so we decided to get this fruit holder in an attempt to make our fruit display  classy  . 
but they are still the best thing out there . 
it also comes with a small micro fiber cloth for cleaning the screen before application . 
this is my first and only juicer so i don t have anything to compare to . 
beautifully polished metal with no noticeable flaws anywhere . 
compact and easy to carry ,  until you attach your iphone to it . 
plus ,  this product is still working good as new . 
there is a note attached to it saying do not put in dishwasher . 
i absolutely love these glasses !  the are thick and don t chip easy ,  plus easy to clean . 
they are excellent quality and fit right into my breville . 
silicone so easy to put on and take off . 
i love that they allow me to turn on my music ,  start jogging ,  and forget about them completely . 
i prefer slightly bigger pieces that i can taste more ,  but it really depends on the person and dish . 
the price of this was right ,  i had a gift card so i thought i would try it . 
overall i m extremely happy with this roaster and glad i made the purchase . 
once in place it looks great and gives a very secure feel to the phone . 
i guess it pays to read the entire description . 
it can be a stinker to clean up ,  but what isn t ?  . 
i still store food but have to be careful not to tip the container . 
i clean it after each use and there must be a least a tablespoon of left over grinds . 
this allows me to make and save two portions for my husband and i ,  and more for later . 
my only complaint is i wish they would last longer and stay sharp . 
the iphone has great graphics and nice applications ,  but is a pretty basic device . 
pasta cooks very nicely in this combination ,  as does steamed vegetables . 
i can walk away and wait for the buzzer . 
i bought two of these khaki with black trim ,  one for me and one for my best friend . 
there were no left over food areas around the ejection flipper or anywhere around the serving head . 
these chargers will add a couple hours of talk time but not fully charge your phone . 
i hate when glass carafes break and i wanted an unbreakable option . 
this twirl whisk is deceptively powerful and versatile . 
i am also going to purchase another for sitting outside . 
this was a great purchase and without hesitation i m purchasing the larger version . 
some people left negative comments about the whistle and it rusting out . 
sounds great ,  clear and enough bass for the size . 
you definitely do not need to be a gourmet chef to appreciate this pan . 
this serrated utility knife works well in a great variety of applications . 
well made ,  simple design ,  easy to use ,  easy to clean ,  and consistent performance . 
i sampled some of my favorite songs ,  as well as various movie clips . 
took me a few minutes to put together and just beautiful . 
i aways use it while i am cooking . 
if you can get a plantronics gel that will work just fine . 
also be careful when you wash the lid . 
there is a net zippered pouch on the outside of the zippered cover for smaller utensils . 
will hardly ever break on linoleum or when dropped in the sink . 
i strongly feel eggshell thin and delicate glass should not have metal clamped down on it . 
i am pleased with this grill even though it cannot replace the jennair cooktop grill . 
ours works wonderfully and have no problem with chunks or slipping . 
she liked it so i also ordered one for myself . 
to start out with ,  i always have trouble with every phone i get . 
fits much better than the one that came with my otterbox . 
i have had a pair of these shears in my kitchen for the last num_num years . 
but ,  i think that s what s really nice about this case .  .  . feels and looks well made . 
it should have ample volume while driving at highway num_extend
as a gift ,  my granddaughter says that she really appreciated my gift . 
not an expert but anyone can do it . 
i highly recommend this sweeper and the seller . 
my only problem is i wish i would have opted for purple instead  love purple  . 
what makes this mixer even better are the additional attachments . 
the high quality leads me to anticipate this is a lifer . 
they look wonderful on my white iphone and dont leave any sticky residue on the home button . 
many thanks to all the reviewers who made my long search for the perfect espresso machine become a reality . 
the included  turbo frother  steam wand attachment and rubber  crema enhancer  are useless . 
fortunately ,  though ,  this little grill is still rocking and rolling along . 
very satisfied with the product and the and its functionality . 
from what other tell me ,  that is unusual when compared to higher priced competitors . 
before putting it away ,  i give it a quick wipe with a thin layer of cooking oil . 
i have it set in the center and that is prefect . 
this was also an improvement over the jabra num_extend what you need to know about limitations . 
i ve found this product worked great for me . 
and i have been enjoying good coffee since . 
i put everything in the sink when done eating and fill with water . 
the velcro is noisy ,  but not as bad as others i ve tried . 
also use them for pairs of hamburger patties and other single and double meat portions . 
i thinks she thinks it charges it self or i will do it for her . 
physical keyboard is almost useless ,  but onscreen keyboard is very good and better than num_extend
you use it to microwave liquids in it . but do not try and use it directly on a kitchen range . 
this product is outstanding !  i love it !  it does so many things ,  toast ,  bake ,  broil ,  convection etc . 
this grater is great to have for quick grating of things that are small . 
i use it also for mashing up tomato sauce ,  sweet potatoes and lots of avocados . 
products slip through qc sometimes ,  or can even receive damage during shipping that is invisible to the eye . 
the first couple of times i used the skillet ,  it produced a lot of smoke . 
the grillwork is safe and removes for easy cleaning . 
i needed an extra muffin pan for a large batch of cupcakes i made over the weekend . 
and lots of time there is enough charge to get me thru an session without charging it . 
with this headset no one knows whether i am using my phone or my headset . 
i do clean and dry it after every use . 
glad i decided on the proctor silex ,  it has been great for the money . 
just what i needed for my iphone with a case . 
the only problem is that they aren t the easiest to put up . 
i love my iphone but as most people know ,  their battery life isn t the best . 
i wouldnt buy it just for use to marinade or just for storage . 
will continue to enjoy for years and pass along . 
these are great characteristics considering we need it most during winter nights . 
the glitter on the back of the cases doesn t come off at all on your hands or clothes . 
i love this corkscrew ,  i will never go back to the double handled versions again . 
there are fewer loose leaves floating around in my cup and the tea seems to brew much better . 
is this any better or worse than other os ?  no . 
i keep the temperature dialed at the low setting and that seems to work . 
i bought these for everyday dishes in our second home and i really like them . 
the tiny bowl on top is of limited usefulness and i usually end up using only the large bowl . 
assembly was easy  my num_extend old figured it out  . 
and to tell you the truth ,  i haven t really figured out the defrost settings for certain items  like bread  . 
unless ,  of course ,  i just want to catch people s attention with this . 
whether you use green apples ,  red apples ,  granny smith ,  whatever . 
the new one is taller than she is . 
this is the only case i found for the torch that stays on and is robust . 
i utilized this to make my own phone cover . 
i bought this belkin case to replace my disintegrating otterbox . 
no need to shop around ,  buy the best for a very reasonable price . 
black flakes started pouring out when i washed it . 
i bought and used this steam cleaner for the first time today and am very pleased with it . 
 : d this is one of the best parts of my kitchen . 
first you put on the silicone skin part and line it up correctly . 
this has changed my life ,  making cookies is so easy now !  . 
i don t know if these  fell off the back of a truck  or not ,  but the quality is superb . 
it came well packaged without any perceivable damage . 
there are a lot of good big insulated bottles out there but they seem overkill size wise . 
it has a strong handle and i suspect it will last more than num_num months . 
for the time being that i had this product because i sold the phone it was great . 
i never used my voice command on my phone prior to getting this unit . 
and that s the only real downside to them . 
i am looking forward to making more very soon . 
no brainer gifts for not just yourself ,  but great for students etc . 
the fibermesh weave on the tip works very well . 
i bought this because i was a little disgusted by the microwavable popcorn bags you buy at the store . 
it looks beautiful and gives every inch of your ipod total protection from impact and damage . 
if i had three thumbs i would give these three thumbs up . 
i love the yogurt this makes ,  and it couldn t be easier . 
relatively solid items ,  like ice cream ,  butter or ganache are rolled within the scoop to form a ball . 
the lid s underside dome shape helps assist in that ,  like a domed teakettle . 
i love and use this phone car charger all the time . 
fair price on the part ,  perfect description and match ,  vacuum works like new again !  . 
no complaints yet ,  it s also a very good deal compared to other cheap cases out there . 
i bought these last year and still have quite a few left from the bulk i bought . 
it comes preloaded with the new blackberry os num_extend
i don t have a lot of room to store all different sizes ,  so this works great !  . 
it wasn t too bad at first and i continued to use them for another month or so . 
i bought this as a surprise and he put it up immediately . 
we re still hoping for a better peeler than this ,  but this one is pretty darn good . 
works well and the blue light up motorola insignia looks nice . 
and it isn t even close from first to second place . 
i always used a little butter or oil to greased first before pouring in the batter . 
not sure if its just new or because theres something wrong . 
i use these for cutting fondant for cake and cupcake decoration . 
i did a lot of research on the popular ,  better knife brands before buying . 
it does as close to a perfectly straight cut as is possible . 
we ve had these model pots and pans for several years now ,  and absolutely love them . 
i will be ordering another set so when company comes there are enough settings . 
the black barrel is classic and subtle . this is a really nice stylus . 
we are very health conscious about what kinds of foods we eat  we are pescetarian  and only buy organic . 
my first one broke right at the bridge section of the headset where it rests on the ear . 
knew we wanted another braun ,  so this was the logical choice for a replacement . 
the case is well built and feels sturdy . 
but then i will guess most juicers are . 
i m almost not using my normal wall chargers any more ,  using this one is just so much more convenient ?  . 
not my choice at all since i love to cook ,  but hey who am i to judge . 
i also bought num_num qts one for bigger jobs a few years ago ,  which has been equally good . 
we purchased the first num_num years ago and used it twice daily ,  sometimes three times daily . 
it s the perfect size for most of your needs . 
it s such a simple design flaw and i hope amazon fixes it soon . 
after reading bundles of stuff about juice extractors ,  i bought my very first one . 
i received this dyson vacuum as a gift when we moved into our new home . 
i read a lot of reviews of these . 
none of this two k cups to get the cup filled !  . 
because there is a lot of greased parts ,  you can t dunk any of the parts in hot soapy water . 
it has better volume than any headset i have tested . 
the machine is easy to assemble and disassemble . 
i think things look good in num_extend on the table . 
i then added shamrock and turquoise to my collection . 
i live with num_num long haired cats and a long haired dog . 
these bowls deserve five stars for their quality . 
this is the pan i prefer for high heat searing . 
here s the best part :  the phone is also a modem . 
the num_num blue lights reveal the charge level it holds . 
they re black with dirt ,  but still run as quietly as when they were new . 
very powerful so keep it in the cup or you will get to clean up a mess . 
if you follow the directions ,  you should not need the other . 
don t go for plastic ones ,  they don t last long and tend to get stained . 
i m about a year in on my grinder and it is the best i have used . 
my all clad can t make the same claim and they cost a bunch more as we all know . 
i think for the price amazon offers it  after rebate  you have a hard time finding a better bargain . 
this silicone case provides protection of the camera and prevents the screen from touching a surface it s placed on . 
well crafted appliance ,  with an easy clean up and its a work horse . 
it s not a boom box ,  but for normal listening it is quite fine and the tonal quality is excellent . 
i also put mini colored marshmallows on the turrets . 
this cabinet is everything the product description says it is and more . 
the cutouts for volume ,  camera ,  power ,  microusb port ,  headphone jack ,  mic ,  camera lens ,  and speaker are spot on perfect . 
out of the box ,  it s easy to setup . 
the dust is sucked right in and doesn t push the dust around like other vacuums . 
it fits very well ,  and i received it on time . 
the first time i ordered this ,  it arrived shattered in a million pieces . 
i carry many portable devices and sometimes i m away from the office or home all day long . 
the fm radio is nice and easy to change to . 
i had no trouble with sticking and it cleaned up quick and easy . 
i really don t have any use for it so i can t give any review on it . 
one word of caution ,  do not put the fat stopper in your dishwasher . 
this cuisinart is one of the best things i have ever purchased for my kitchen . 
at num_extend it won t charge larger devices as quickly  nexus num_extend galaxy note num_num etc .  .   ,  but will still work . 
at any rate ,  i use it often enough that i have decided to replace it . 
i bought this to work with a palm num_extend years ago . 
i love everything about the bowl; the size ,  the shape; the feel; and especially the color . 
i was looking for another krups ,  when this caught my eye . 
with an case on the iphone tooooo tight . 
they arrive in three layers . first layer is removed to adhere it onto your screen . 
i love being able to bake up healthy tacos with ease . 
i have several speaker stands in different rooms ,  and these are the best . 
what else could you sear num_num num_num ounce ribeye steaks together in ?  . 
worked great ,  tasted as good as what comes out of my whirley pop stovetop popper . 
the only other thing that they really need is a small num_extend quart  sauce pan . 
the quality isn t perfect ,  but better quality screens will cost you a lot more . 
the jabra will also tell you the battery life via voice . 
he tried it and really liked it as well . 
the handles have oxo s trademark sticky rubber grips that make holding the cups easy . 
i travel quite a bit for work and possess many devices for which the battery is coming in handy . 
only one piece and they keep the air out . 
it is light ,  easy to empty and clean the filter . 
i haven t put it in the freezer ,  but it microwaves just fine . 
this headset easily connects to my iphone and my computer for wireless music and telephone calls . 
however ,  boos makes such a variety of boards ,  i wish i had room for a few different ones . 
num_num stars because the quality is fairly cheesy . 
i got them ,  of course ,  so i can clip my hair into a topknot and play samurai sushi cook . 
with this being stainless steel ,  it should serve us for years to come . 
it has a low price and is very comfortable to use . 
makes the perfect pizza . i bought this hoping to make a perfect pizza right away and it didn t happen . 
i used a flat edged cookie sheet to slide the paper and stromboli onto once it was fully baked . 
the fact that you can use it for bluetooth is a plus also . 
it does what it is supposed to do ,  allow conversations ,  and does that very well . 
nice tight lid and stackable in the fridge . 
when i mean by fit s perfect ,  it means that there isn t any space on the inside . 
i will say ,  this press is one of the best you can buy . 
with num_num some odd hours of service on a charge i do not see any problems with that plan . 
my cuisinart is num_num years old and still working . 
works like a charm every time and is a snap to clean !  . 
you ll never wear it out ,  can t say that about much these days . 
they claim the sensation cannot run sense num_extend
these bowls are durable ,  heavy and the perfect size for what i needed . 
the new trent icruiser num_extend is a quality product . 
it amplifies the speakers quite well on my husbands num_extend
it has a good alarm sound . we just made a turkey with it last night and it was absolutely perfect . 
the case itself was nicked ,  but the phone was fine . 
saves a lot of counter space and cools the cookies quickly !  . 
i like the fact that each cup is very hot and fresh . 
they don t tend to pick up flavors ,  are great in teflon ,  very rigid for scraping and last like crazy . 
kind of flopped around at a variable distance from my ear . 
we love the robust feel of these style of glasses . 
i figured for $ this would be no great shakes but it s a very well built little pitcher . 
just use a bit of common sense .  .  . people  :   . 
i also have a pair of philips noise canceling buds ,  similar price . 
i still think this is a great crock pot . 
i whipped up homemade pizza dough in about num_num minutes ,  including the kneading time . 
there are many other versions of the samsung num_extend but the other phones are made a little different . 
it can go from the microwave to the table . 
fits over the ear comfortably ,  holds the samsung securely just like the original did . 
i have not use it for anything else yet . 
won t use any other type again !  i highly recommend !  . 
to measure or not to measure that is the question . 
i ve been using this to bake sweets but mostly chicken breast and fish . 
it gets stuck in between the layers of the yellow section and it s really hard to clean . 
the spout can be a little sloppy on pouring so pour slowly to avoid spills . 
i do find myself using this toaster oven every day . 
when i got the num_extend generation kindle mostly all books  not counting text books  were $ or less . 
the hot chocolate pot ,  however ,  had settlement on the bottom and that kept getting thicker and thicker . 
this is practical ,  of a good quality and priced well . 
always remember to clean your screen and change your protector is a lint free area . 
they are going above and beyond to resolve the situation . 
the shape is stable but looks a bit unstable . 
this is a great cover for the iphone . 
the texture is just right when its finished . 
this charger glows solid yellow while charging and slowly goes to a solid green color at full charge . 
it seemed to be functioning correctly ,  but when i stopped to check ,  both garlic cloves were virtually untouched . 
the sound is better than using my phone and people can hear me without any static . 
this kettle heats water in a matter of seconds and you absolutely can t beat the price . 
it has a large compartment where i can place several cloves at once . 
this is one really good looking hook ,  and sturdy too . 
nice ,  sturdy ,  strong beer mugs with a nice design . 
it didn t swish when i shook it ,  so i thought i was good to go . 
for example i buy chicken in large quantities when it is on sale ,  and grind it up . 
i bought this to cut out the back bone of a turkey . 
i work as a chef and this is the mandoline of choice . 
the window fan works great and it s not too loud so i had no problem falling asleep . 
i m guessing that mason jars aren t quite the standard in germany though . 
the grill side is even worse and it s very difficult to clean . 
it was super easy to assemble !  very roomy ,  and much sturdier than i expected for plastic . 
i love how big swirls you can get with these tips . 
the sound quality is superb ,  and the functions are outstanding . 
i also like how it it can rotate num_num degrees and can move up ,  down ,  in ,  and out . 
one can not beat good stainless steal to cook with and ease of cleaning . 
without the skin ,  the display has a very smooth ,  glass surface . 
i was looking for a new spatula and noticed that america s test kitchen recommended this brand . 
what s neat is the way they have affixed the wires to the handle . 
great case for work and not very bulky . 
since it s lacking in preservatives ,  the sauce doesn t last as long as store bought  and it s a quart  . 
what s great is if you own the cuisinart num_extend stock pot ,  the lid works on the skillet as well . 
no fade outs ,  no problems . worn properly ,  these interfere with my glasses a bit . 
the mirror finish is great other than that . 
my husband and i are in the kitchen all the time . 
i ve used this product for a while and actually just purchased a second and one for a friend . 
i just used what i had on hand ,  but this works great . 
all controls function correctly and audio is clear . 
i have had mine num_extend cup version i . e . 
i also don t have to worry when grandchildren come to visit . 
i had just about decided that chopping vegetables two knives held in one hand is most efficient . 
after about another three ,  i just put on another one from the packet and we re good as new . 
they have dropped their iphone num_extend numerous times . 
this item arrived in a matter of days . 
the plastic handles on the lid and the pan itself stay fairly cool under most stovetop conditions . 
this a great made in usa cooking twine . 
they adhere to your phone screen really well and last a long time . 
i like it lots better than the hot air poppers . 
it is amazing how many horrible can openers there are . 
this is the set of dishes that mom bought before her death . 
but i think my favorite part was that amazonbasics is very easy to open . 
i don t know how i made do all these years without a num_extend skillet . 
i ll be shopping for it in other colors !  . 
one neat feature is the blue glowing emblem; futuristic looking . 
perfect for cooking for one or two people or for side dishes . 
i have to remove to get into the case . 
i think i ve only opened the kickstand twice .  .  .  . both times ,  my fingernails almost came off . 
however ,  should you feel safer using one ,  foil does serve as an appropriate placement . 
it gets into all the crevices and cleans very well . 
this set offers all the right size baking dishes ,  plus a pie pan and measuring cup . 
in low power the noise is not as bad ,  and this is the primary setting i keep it on . 
a very well made and easy to use cookie cutters . 
i would definitely recommend this case to anyone with a droid x . 
two level options are included  high and low  ,  choose which one is right for you . 
they nest perfectly and look nice enough to use as servingware . 
this set replaced a bunch of plastic storage containers . 
all i can say about the pot is that it makes an excellent cup of coffee in num_num minutes . 
i just like to bake for fun and try new recipes . 
it s very easy to adjust the angle and switch a phone from portrait to landscape . 
i just got this headset from best buy . 
my family loves mashed potatoes and when i make them i make a lot . 
the sides fold around which makes the grater very sturdy . 
on the edgecraft num_extend the crumbs fall directly down onto a clear plastic tray that comes with the product . 
both are onyx black . i do prefer the one pictured .  .  . i purchased at target . 
it has a nice smooth feel and it fits nicely on my phone . 
i guess there is a reason why they are just referred to as  microplanes  on tv ,  instead of graters . 
after purchasing this brand and type of airtight jars . 
this charger works fine ,  does the job ,  would recommend . 
as i love stong ,  tasty tea ,  i started by using one lipton iced tea gallon size tea bag . 
not when we can make them to order at home . 
its upper iron comes down and you flip it over to lock the two irons together . 
it went right in and immediately went into car mode . 
the central area is strong and holds my heaviest knife  a meat cleaver  with no problem . 
in just a few hours the seller contacted me again to tell me everything had been handled . 
the other issue is the size of the iphone and battery when connected . 
i am buying a house and i bought this because of price . 
however ,  i wouldn t trade comfort for smaller handles . 
it whips up dough and cookie batters effortlessly . 
i would definitely recommend it to a friend . 
i also like it for melting cheese on toast . 
this is by far the most comfortable and easiest to use . 
i also like that it includes a battery life indicator with the press of a button . 
i love how you can break the waffle into four squares for freezing and popping into the toaster . 
works with my two plantronics bluetooth earpieces ,  as well as all the phones listed above . 
the machine is easy . with a three position switch you can choose off ,  steam or coffee . 
quality product that wouldnt hesistate to buy again . 
didn t interfere with headphone jack ,  charging port ,  silent switch ,  or any of the buttons . 
this is durable and does a great job steaming . 
the additional info on cleaning is particularly helpful . 
my wife used one of these at a friends house and came back specifically asking for this one . 
i use it in my htc glacier which is an android phone . 
these bowls have a very useful and deep shape to them . 
i was able to use them correctly and they were able to protect my samsung galaxy num_extend phone . 
having to stop the bike at every turn and pull out the phone from my pack was time consuming . 
just wish i was able to find bigger sizes to come in the set as well . 
i think i paid under $ for it but don t quote me . 
he has been using it daily since !  and anytime we have company he makes them coffee from this . 
this design is perfect !  i recommend one for every kitchen . 
stays securely connected to the computer and phone . 
nothing worse than having a brand new phone die on you because of a power spike on the line !  . 
other than that ,  it functions perfectly and exceeded our expectations for a reasonably priced charger . 
playing flac files doesn t strain the phone . awesome !   it s nice to have the num_num gb limit for micro sd cards . 
guess we just need to work harder at getting them to turn it off before walking away !  . 
i have had three other indoor grills so far ,  two of which costed more than the delonghi . 
i don t use my old alarm clock any more , just my droid . 
functional ,  good grind range ,  reasonably quiet ,  love the look . 
it fits very well and doesn t move around a lot . 
it remains incredibly sharp and friction free when slicing . 
add more water before switching to this hook . 
lots of options for timing ,  although i haven t tried to delay the baking of the loaf yet . 
these spoons are easy to hold and use . 
with very little effort it looks like great effort was taken . 
it s also much easier to clean in my opinion . 
when i go swimming i generally grab my phone ,  drivers license ,  a credit card and keys to the car . 
this coffee grinder is just perfect for my needs . 
the thickness of the resulting discs is perfect to hold the fillings for these dishes . 
as he is the one that does the cooking of breakfast . 
for those of you without metal oven doors like me ,  it rests nicely on the countertop . 
but ,  how easy it makes preparing meat and foul . 
the quality of this oven exceeded my expectations ,  and my expectations were high . 
my only complaint is that it won t side sideways along side the board for storage . 
i love that i can start things out on the stove and then finish in the oven . 
the num_num watt selection will heat up a room in short order . 
just put in the microwave with a paper towel draped over the top so it does not splatter . 
overall ,  this is a very rugged case ,  and really protected my phone to the max . 
it is made of plastic ,  but it does not feel flimsy . 
if you are like me ,  you have an ever growing collection of usb devices . 
i called presto and ordered a replacement drip pan for $ including shipping . 
but the flip side is that you would like to keep it on ,  while on your ear . 
there is no more economical food saving device in existance . 
it s as hot as boiling water; however it evaporates quickly leaving the floors to dry very quickly . 
has a nice feel and look and works just like it claims to do . 
i bought num_num and would buy more if i had more need . 
the double boiler worked well though ,  so no harm done . 
i got this for my husband because he is rough on his stuff . 
oh ,  and they happen to do a great job of peeling oranges . 
i like the bags because you don t have to measure and cut ,  and only have to seal one side . 
there is a learning curve in using this phone s features and the shortcut keys . 
to keep the peace ,  i decided i d better get another one . 
the bodum coffee was a lot hotter ,  had better body and flavor ,  and was done a lot num_extend
after observing this i also compared the lighting charger with this charger as well with my ipad num_extend
this would make the volume and sound reproduction infinitely greater . 
the handles are pom synthetic which is good for sanitation . 
i regard this limitation as a worthwhile tradeoff for eggs perfectly cooked to my doneness preference . 
they fall apart when using them in such a few minutes of scrubing with the pad it fell apart . 
and the noise is deafening because it is so strong . 
i love this case and it arrived on time . 
considering i live in mn it isn t always mostly though  feasible to grill outside during the winter . 
make sure you have a level and pencil for the job . 
wish i had bought something like this a long time ago . 
i feel like its honestly better than a lot of cases out there . 
i m pleasantly surprised and have been using it for months without any problems . 
i also use it as a cheese knife as well . 
put your lids and rims into hot water then pick them out . 
its simple enough for kids and fun to use . 
this is a gift for my young granaughter that loves all creatures ,  big and small . 
its okay though ,  it still fits ,  works good . 
this is as described but for some reason ,  i was still expecting it to be a little larger . 
i should have looked at dimension before i purchased . 
looks nice and has a nice velvet pouch to keep it in . 
we had taco salad night for the first time using these pans and they far exceeded my expectations . 
i have slender cabinets ,  so sometimes finding under shelf products to fit can be difficult . 
result on a beige carpet is a number of ground in dirt spots of various descriptions . 
i cannot see how you could go wrong with these wonderful stoppers . 
i bought these several months ago and i am very satisfied . 
i see these in the mall for num_num bucks . 
i love corelle have for years ,  it is soooooo versatile . 
the cup shape is slightly tapered which facilitates using them as scoops . 
the screws go into metal threads that are drilled into the wood pieces . 
out of the box ,  the finish does not resemble  stainless steel  . 
pour the broth mixture into the separator  following all instructions carefully  . 
it had good reviews  thanks amazonians !   ,  and cost a bit less than similar grills i saw while browsing . 
both my husband and i have the iphone num_extend
i would like it better if they could increase the battery life . 
i have bought these for years and use them for wet and dry storage . 
i have a bunch of inexpensive earrings ,  necklaces and bracelets that i rotate through everyday . 
it is great for meatloaf no more soggyness . 
i used to buy wooden racks which would last a year if i m lucky . 
i purchased this sim card on amazon because they were $ in the stores . 
shipping does take time ,  but you know that going in if you ve read the product description . 
no one knows i am on a headset . 
they come from the factory with a pretty good edge ,  better than most any inexpensive knife . 
these are by far my favorite wireless headphones ,  i take these everywhere ,  almost everyday . 
to my iphone s credit ,  it has survived without damage all three times !  but . 
but you need to dry the pasta sheets somewhat before you cut them . 
avoid breaking the pot by following the cleaning instructions . 
we hit a few good bumps the nothing fell out of it ,  love it . 
i will be buying them again soon since everyone in my family has iphones . 
at this price ,  it is an excellent choice . 
i read many reviews on several tumbler brands . 
this meant one couldn t put anything in the feedtube . 
works great with my  galaxy s num_extend num_extend and num_extend and galaxy note num_extend
the food doen t get burnt and neither do my hands !  would recommend to all good cooks . 
we really like the handles whichmakes it easy to remove from the oven . 
i was super impressed with this at first . 
this cover is great for what it is designed to protect against . 
once people find out how great this knife is made ,  it will probably than start selling for more . 
it s been a week and i m still impressed with this item . 
if you like a cocktail at the end of the day these are you best friends . 
it feels better in the hand ,  like more grip . 
this garmet bag i have all my coats in it and it does it job . 
a few weeks ago i ordered this stainless one and i couldn t be happier . 
yuck !  but ,  i refuse to pay that much for a new filter for a cheap hand vac . 
the vertical form factor makes it easy to store in a cupboard  small num_extend
these have been packed and moved a couple of times also . 
brita ,  i find to be great taste ,  like spring water . 
the first class is a demonstration by the instructor on how to put together a tiered cake . 
do not use any metal utensils or harsh scouring pads on the pan . 
also something i can live with ,  considering the quality and functionality of this product . 
the attachment piece doesn t fit in my iphone so i just unclasped it . 
this is a replacement for one that i broke . 
i put it in upside down and it acts like a dispenser . 
i bought this for my iphone num_num and loved it . 
to be sure ,  cast iron does take some special care in cooking ,  cleaning ,  oiling and storage . 
so i guess that part is up to us . 
i ve only had this grinder for three weeks ,  but it sure seems like a winner so far . 
not exactly as easy as butter ,  but close to it . 
it has worked very well ,  better than most plastic swatters that we have had in the past . 
this is the same brita refil sold in stores and the usual price is between num_num and num_num dollars . 
i have used it to make coffee with the screen filter provided and it tasted delicious . 
however ,  it s not a problem at work ,  and at home ,  the hub is hidden behind a monitor . 
rotating it from vertical to horizontal format is a snap . 
no ,  they don t make them like that anymore  . 
i put flour in one ,  and dog treats in the other . 
this is among the best of the oxo tools i ve owned . 
i ve been fortunate and never had to replace any of my pans . 
be careful wiping this thing out though that blade is sharp . 
the flexibility makes this an easy cover to get on and off . 
it s held it s shape ,  and looks great !  i would definitely recommend this . 
what can i say ,  you can t beat the price and product works as described . 
however the price has almost doubled since i bought these making them a very expensive proposition . 
it basically will illuminate a light to advise when the unit needs cleaned with vinegar and water . 
leave it to cuisipro to save my baking station . 
however ,  in practice we rarely use the num_num inch width . 
it provides a great place to locate my cell phone or bluetooth stereo speaker . 
working without issue to charge samsung galaxy num_extend
or at least a case that can carry both the battery and an iphone cable . 
looks great on the table and does a good job . 
i drink coffee everyday and this was not cool . 
however ,  the num_extend gives a battery indicator on my iphone num_extend
maybe i had a defective one ,  but it also did not suck up the water . 
i don t do much canning ,  but i do store dry goods and liquids in mason jars . 
necessary for the vegan and raw food kitchen . 
the slide out crumb tray is a huge plus . 
i adore this crystal and it just gleams with my silver and china . 
the knife is durable and i plan on using this knife for many years to come . 
if a product has any small issue ,  it tends to get under my skin . 
it s a decent size and perfect for what i need it for . 
my issue with the pot is a personal one . 
i had no idea it would be so beautiful . 
you could potentially use it to mix and knead cookie and bread dough . 
recommended by consumer reports so i got it for my kitchen and bathroom faucets . 
after losing my first one due to a housefire i was again rewarded when my second one arrived . 
i love the style of the mugs and know from past experience the durability of the product . 
i have tested it with bothcanon powershot num_extend grams  andcanon powershot num_extend grams  . 
no ironing is needed if removed from the dryer at the end of the permanent press cycle . 
i had the bubbles right out of the box for the former version . 
overall ,  this sifter is sturdy and carries the oxo name with pride . 
not only does it work again ,  but now i don t have to hold it down to keep it going . 
this unit has performed above my expectations with every food item i have prepared with it . 
the phone should easily withstand a drop from num_extend
everybody has been thrilled with the ice cream we ve made with it . not cheap but worth it . 
no need to give instructions to the kids . 
she didn t want to purchase a kuerig for work and this items works great for her . 
a few scuffs show up from regular use ,  but nothing of great num_extend
the only caution i have is that the plastic is really thin . 
the lids fit well and the clamps are not so tight that you feel like the lids might break . 
custom wallpapers ,  ringtones ,  alarm clocks ,  animated screen savers ,  advanced launchers ,  custom security lockout screens and more are available online . 
i ve never had anyone say they can t hear me or that i sound muffled . 
my home is mostly wood and tile flooring with a few area rugs . 
would have liked it being easier to remove . 
i started back when the first bt headsets came out . 
this is a great item . the quality is superior and the price is amazing . 
i received a blue one of these for christmas but i broke the pumper so i ordered this one . 
considering what styluses are running stateside ,  these styluses are great . 
the highlights based on owning the black case . 
i d love to get cobwebs on the ceiling and dust off the fan in the bathroom . 
rosle has other versions of this item that will grate more finely . 
the pots are great for sauces ,  soups and anything that requires boiling a large amount of water . 
these are very nice baskets that i m using in my kitchen . 
i pressed the button on the headset to answer ,  it answered it on my earpiece . 
also ,  you can use metal utensils but it will leave very fine scratches . 
i made a test batch as soon as it arrived and the pancakes are adorable . 
i use it on my motorcycle and my phone or gps stays put . 
its a lot better than the ones that don t have no indication lights on it . 
excess fat must be trimmed from steak or the grinder will back up . 
i looked at them at several other sites and amazon beat the prices hands down . 
i was able to recharge my nexus num_num completely and still had num_num bars left . 
i do recommend it to sensation num_extend customers . 
i bought this to steam vegetables and couscous . it worked amazing for both . 
of course ,  i knew this when i bought it ,  but it would ve been a nice feature . 
when learning my trade in paris ,  france ,  i used only the finest sabatier knives . 
it even has some basic timing for foods printed on the base . 
i highly recommend ! update :  after num_num months the cord i used every night to charge my phone quit working . 
this battery lasts about num_num days without being charged . 
it s small ,  simple to use ,  and effective . the salad spinner consists of three parts . 
this was the best price i could find . 
and it will put the cork back in the bottle too . 
it works great and at a great price !  highly recommend . 
the reviews convinced me to give it a try ,  and i m so glad i bought one . 
i have num_num pairs of these and could not cook without them . 
in short ,  this is something anyone can use ,  even if you need instructions to boil water . 
it is made of plastic and can easily slip right through your hands . 
i now have five left for when this one gets scratched . 
i can t knock the product for that though !  . 
great product ,  works in my num_num toyota prius . 
i kept buying box fans and the motor kept dying on them after only a few months of use . 
get one for yourself and one for a gift . 
all and all ,  it s a pretty solid holster . 
i prefer thezagg invisibleshield for apple iphone num_num  front  front  . 
where i live we only have a walmart and the do not carry any thing close to this quality . 
the rubber hits the vol and shutter buttons on my lumia num_extend so it requires careful positioning . 
have bought at least four of these from amazon over the years . 
we live in tropical humid area where glasses with cold liquids and ice sweat constantly and make a mess . 
you will be amazed at how much dust these will pull out of the air in your home . 
even with all the apps shut down ,  the battery life is only a few hours . 
unlike other very protective cases ,  this one isn t very wide which is great . 
i don t blame the machine for this ,  just don t do it . 
i was surprised that making popcorn this way tasted so good . 
clean up is a breeze ,  as nothing seems to stick to the surface . 
just a battleship gray rectangular box and a stubby antenna . 
have not tried it yet in very noisy paces but i am sure it will be fine . 
by far ,  the best feature is the removable plates . 
since losing all of my stuff sometime ago ,  i have had to start all over again . 
i thought the battery was dying on my original and changed it out . 
this handle is bigger ,  and seems to create more separation between blade and back of fingers . 
i have not had any problems with it so far . 
target does not package them properly for shipping . 
make my own almond milk ,  lemon infused water ,  etc . 
nice snug tight fit and small so it does not stand out much . 
i prefer carrying an extra battery rather than using the extended battery . 
i used them yesterday to make hamburger buns with yeast dough in the oven . 
i ve been using this little fan for about num_num years . 
we use ours to hold dish towels in the kitchen ,  and hang on cabinet knobs . 
 please manufacture ,  dont redesign it to do this  . 
i d definitely recommend this product to anyone in the market for a good ,  reliable food processor . 
this bowl is perfect with it s bright color and no flaws ,  will continue to add to my collection . 
the color was so bright and better then i remember it being on here . 
i thought his art was lost as i have not made a decent cup of coffee in many years . 
a little hard to get aligned up properly . 
i am a one person household so the size is just right for me . 
i expect it to last until vz offers  g note  . 
the gadget i bought at the same time that i really love is the silicone garlic peel remover . 
you can scrub and use the most abrasive pads to clean the pot and never worry . 
but i jus recieved them today and i really like them . 
bought it for my new espresso machine and is a necessary accessory for anyone who has an espresso machine . 
i hone my knives frequently and this steel does the job . 
when i receieved these as a gift ,  i was so happy . 
beautiful machine ,  works great ,  and quiet ,  considering what it s doing . 
i change my case almost daily to match all of my toms and other shoes i own . 
i make a huge glass of juice and chug it down . 
but this one looks as good as it performs . 
we recently gave up our microwave ,  and the only thing i couldn t do without it was make popcorn . 
i use my phone as num_extend player and also light web browsing among other things . 
i don t know if this happens with other brands ,  but it is a minor annoyance that i can overlook . 
not a biggie considering i knew the ipaq actually has a faster core processor speed at num_num vs . 
i m surprised by the reviews that say these aren t big enough for a pasta entree . 
please do yourself a favor and purchase this; it s slim and professional looking . 
having two sizes is a real plus and the lid fits both . 
i find throwing it in the dishwasher every now and then helps with removing some of the staining . 
the whole family immediately chose which color would be theirs . 
the pan is so clean ,  you might not realize it s been used . 
it has never given me a bad batch of ice cream ,  and we make it all summer long . 
it does exactly what it s made to do without leaking or being too fancy . 
nothing sticks to it .  .  .  .  . period !  !  have made num_num cakes in it and am very pleased with the results . 
cost of filters aside ,  it makes an unbeatable cup of coffee . 
i  ironed  out the couple bubbles i got on my first application and i have absolutely no complaints . 
after owning a kitchenaid for eight years ,  i thought i would buy another one . 
the scale is beautiful and easy to read . 
i m a big fan of life proof products . 
its honestly like a real mirror on your phone . 
if you like the way  traditional  blenders are designed ,  with screw off bottoms ,  stop reading . 
the two black ends pop out the front with your finger to expose the mounting holes . 
there is a video at the top of this amazon page that is worth watching . 
i just got a new galaxy num_extend and i ordered this case for that phone as well . 
i bought one for the folks ,  too ,  and they re thrilled with it . 
were small durable easy to keep in small kitchen . 
four hours of moderate data and voice usage and the indicator turns orange indicating % or less battery capacity . 
they are thinner than i thought they would be ,  but they sure work well . 
i prefer to have the shiny stainless steel look . 
the battery life is about num_num hours continuous talk time and takes about num_num hour to fully charge . 
it s functional ,  makes the phone grippier and doesn t add much bulk at all . 
same as my two year old battery so i don t think its new . 
have been using it in my car for a long time and never had any problems . 
this is a pretty good vacuum with decent suction and the self propel makes it easy to use . 
this is easily the nicest cutting board i ve ever seen . 
and it is noticeably louder ,  albeit mostly on the treble . 
by far the best cell phone case i have ever owned . 
very well made with handles and pour spount . no more cleanups after making pancakes . 
i have never been disappointed in any taylor thermometer they seem to be well made ,  accurate and durable . 
great fit ,  fine protection ,  and just the right amount of grip . 
i liked it so much ,  i ve ordered num_num more bowls in different sizes . 
my first george foreman grill ,  and i m enjoying the adventure !  this appliance is user friendly . 
i also ordered the presto num_num piece canning set which is very good quality . 
i wanted something that i could use to roll out flat bread and tortillas with . 
i am getting num_num to num_num hours of music time . 
unit is a little larger than i would have liked ,  but all the food slicers have similar dimensions . 
it fits perfect for the num_extend and my daughter love it to . 
this presto hot air popper heats up quickly and pops the majority of kernels . 
i recently changed the filter and noticed that it had picked up a ton of airborne dirt and debri . 
i went over the same carpets with the dyson today . 
this is by far the best bluetooth headset i ve used . 
this is usable ,  but not perfect for me . 
it was easy to put up  and move when i hung to far to one side  . 
but the look is great and exactly what was ordered . 
perfect for slipping into a knife roll ,  super sharp . 
the set came in mail in a couple of days so quick and the product works fine . 
glad to get a replacement for such a good price . 
this board is as legit as you re going to find . 
i ve owned the roomba for over num_num years now and love it . 
haha !  !  this case protects her new iphone num_extend
it cannot do serrated edges or scissors ,  but i am enjoying my very sharp knives . 
we totally messed up the first batch and it tasted like soap . 
the num_num works rather well ,  but suffered from intermittent connection issues and occasional poor signal quality . 
i like that its not stiff like plastic and can absorb some level of num_extend
i would definitely recommend giving these a shot if you are in the market for funnels . 
very handy and isn t in the way of working in my sink . 
this coffee grinder is a great buy on amazon . 
we ve been cooking them on the weber kettle all summer . 
the glass jar is thick and heavy as well . 
i m almost jealous that i did not come up with this design myself . 
would definitely recommend this brand ,  color and model . 
i ve had other cookie scoops ,  but i ve now replaced all of them with the oxo scoops . 
the notification bar is the best i ve seen on any android num_extend
i saw this and just had to get it . 
so you know that can and will drain the battery like crazy . 
these scissors are very sharp and work great !  . 
this keeps my devices going until i can get back to somewhere i can charge them . 
really nice device to keep track with your power consumption . 
this is annoying and something you do not get with ear buds . 
i ve been able to charge my phone numerous times on one charge of this battery pack . 
i think that could be the reason bev and more stopped selling them . 
small knives need to be done carefully though and to keep them straight when sharpening ,  but not too difficult . 
when you get it ,  you will wonder how you ever lived without one of these !  . 
and you need to focus when you have this knife in your hands as it si super sharp . 
this whisk has a comfortable handle ,  is lightweight ,  and seems to be strong built . 
it said it was shipping from florida ,  but it did not . 
this is the absolute best little kitchen item i own . 
the belkin clear screen protector isn t really all that different from most screen protectors of this type . 
and finally something that doesn t come from china . 
the cleaning head has a much more open design ,  and has easy access for cleaning it out . 
i love it !  !  !  !  it looks great with my pink iphone !  !  . 
as a kid ,  i would eat bagles toasted with melted cheddar on top every morning . 
even took it to thailand when we moved there in num_num and used a lot over there . 
you can t go back to a rotten ineffective peeler once you have used these . 
my little cheesecake was the right size and turned out perfectly . 
had a problem with post but nothing terrible . 
i am so glad that i did !  they are perfect for chilling cookie dough or even homemade whipped cream . 
they sound absolutely fantastic and they block out any outside noise extremely well . 
uneven cuts of meat or fish are very difficult to cook . 
it is much smaller than a lot of other ones yet provides ample power for my devices . 
this is a must have device for anyone with a blackberry tour . 
looks great ,  feels great ,  nice grip to hold phone . 
i use it for both . the grind is coarse because you do not have a choice . 
as far as functionality goes ,  it works for me perfectly . 
icy drinks stay icy even in a hot car while i m out running errands . 
i got the num_extend a few days ago and for the most part i am very happy with it . 
i never used a case before because i always had a very large extended battery on my other blackberrys . 
normally ,  i hate measuring utensils on key rings . 
i use both these items for my other cast iron . 
buying a num_num pack saves us from being caught without a backup . 
i would recommend this if you need a toaster . 
they are also quite good at blocking out outside noise . 
the size is perfect to prepare a salad . 
flexes like its going to break or pop off . 
most eseries organizer and phone software are same or similar . 
i am really enjoying my purchase .  .  . if you purchase them you most likely will ,  too . 
this makes it so simple to make them . 
this coffee maker will grind beans ,  then brew ,  or you can just put ground coffee in it . 
soft to the touch and very appealing to the eye . 
this is by far the best accessory you can have for your foodsaver . 
just like the description sais ,  they are easy to apply . 
replacement blades are available on quite a few sites i ve seen the complete set for around fourteen dollars . 
might not last as long as my overpriced cookware ,  but still ,  very ,  very useful ,  and fairly priced . 
i ve had this case for a week now and it works good . 
i bought it becouse remind mine of my childhoold and wanted the fresh taste of butter . in the popcorn . 
the handle is made of oxo s typical  good grips  material ,  so it was comfortable and didn t slip . 
now tilt the paper towards a bowl or whatever . 
bento for my husband mostly because i really wanted to justify my ms . 
it seems i was always talking too soon or too late . all in all ,  a great headset for the $
i ve been using it for several years now and the wife and i love popcorn . 
some people complained about how close the handle is to the pitcher itself . 
heck ,  if you re serving lobster or king crab you can afford a bunch of these . 
this is a quality item ,  it s strong and durable; does its job well . 
i have this in my bedroom window and often forget to shut it off . 
these were very cheap and well worth the money . 
it really does a nice job and one is the correct size for a nice tostado . 
wow ,  i am glad i bought this popper . 
have to be very careful to clean the screen and remove all lint or you ll get bubbles . 
crank the heat up . you have two choices here . 
but other than that ,  there are no complaints . 
we have two kitcens both containing complete sets of microplanes . 
this is exactly as described ,  an oem motorola battery for the droid num_num and num_extend
it is a little bulky and heavy ,  but that adds to it s sturdiness . 
its a little hard to open if you have any pain in hands but still workable . 
i have not been able to make it function . 
try it and you will like it too . 
this protective shield fit my new phone great . 
i bought this case for my wife and she loves it . 
however ,  it would be easier to see if it were some other color ,  such as red or white . 
the make of the bumper does not exude elegance ,  and it feels a bit cheap . 
it worked as advertised and i would recommend it to anyone . 
i am very pleased !  highly highly highly recommend . 
overall very nice and versatile and i would recommend . 
my fault not the products . but i got it anyways and applied it . 
so far ,  none of them have broken ,  and i have had several of them for a few years . 
not worth hanging on your old strung out battery !  . 
its adjustable just by cutting to the size you need . 
i got num_num sets so i can make num_num at a time . 
easy to put together with a few screws  enclosed  . 
the battery is still charging as expected and i have had it for awhile . 
i bought this for the discounted price of $  down from $
gave it to my friend who has a traverse and will never see it again . 
my braun brews wonderful coffee whether it be just a few cups or a full pot . 
it has a built in screen protector that really does protect and the case is so secure . 
i have had this product for about num_num years . 
the machine makes a very good loaf of bread . 
in direct light ,  this product certainly does the trick and deflects the light away . 
will order again when i eventually run out . 
also ,  the metal handle on the lid doesn t get hot somehow ,  which is perfect . 
then  ,  within the first week of actual use ,  one of the drawers started jamming . 
the patterns are great for me because i love bright colors . 
your tablet or phone must have the screen density and capacity to register the strokes on the software side . 
for this price the quality exceeded my expectations . 
i chopped some onions up and placed them in the bottom and placed the chicken inside . 
it is small enough to lift out bars and cake from a regular cake pan . 
i love the deep chamber that holds a couple more ounces than my old one . 
it is very wide ,  so your cookbooks are not peeking out the edges and getting their pages dirty . 
it is pretty heavy and it looks nice ,  i bought the num_num peice set . 
my pastry school instructor recommended using this instead of a knife for chopping chocolate and she was right . 
i either hold the lid or just do not empty all the water . 
i find myself using my grill num_extend as much now . 
this is so easy to use !  i have used rental machines . 
i have used cuisinart cookware for over a decade and i love it . 
i checked the connection ,  and even plugged in my iphone . 
good buy and it covers the whole front frame not just the screen . 
the container is made in prc  people s republic of china  . 
i use these for all my leftovers and they are great . 
we have used this in our oven and on our gas grill . 
providing this information is the cost of admission for functionality of the apps . 
i bought him one on amazon because it was wayyyy cheaper than the ones in the stores . 
i have one of these with a plastic surround and that tends to break off . 
i fit num_num pair of shoes in each cubby spot . 
i bought this because i needed a new knife ,  and it was recommended by cook s illustrated . 
but i think i can safely say that no bt headset has great audio . 
this perfectly fits my cook s essentials num_num qt . 
this is a very beautiful pan ,  and it works really well . 
i bought this to replace the smaller pitchers included with breville s barista express . 
pretty cool ,  huh ? i like this mount a lot . 
the cones do not touch the counter ,  as others have said ,  and it is sturdy . 
i spent a good bit of time reading amazon reviews about treo cases . 
i ve owned a dozen blenders over the past num_num years . 
what can you say about cream chargers ,  they are what they are . 
i bought this for our granddaughter when she comes to visit . 
the plastic case fits snug against the rubber inside piece . 
beer and with the mixes the company sells . 
it is definitely worth the few extra dollars to protect the phone a little longer . 
i threw away all of our non stick pans years ago and switched over to cast iron . 
i purchased this leather case for iphone num_num and it was exactly what i expected . 
this is compounded by the very cold meat ,  which requires more effort to push into the grinder hole . 
all the strange corners and angles inside this container make that difficult . 
i ve dropped my phone a couple of times and the case has fully protected it . 
i was suppose to get the left handed one . 
but we bought another trudeau .  .  . it lasted about five times longer than the closet rival brand . 
however ,  the ironing board cover is pretty thin . 
my other one is for two cups so the four cup will be easier to use it appears . 
the doc for my droid x is quite nice . 
we wanted to get rid of the land line . here is my num_extend
the inner plastic shell that the phone slips into is made well and adds to the protection . 
the mount grips on the sides and then straps down over the phone tightly . 
i am truly grateful it gave up the ghost . 
the handle conditions itself from contact with oily food from time to time ,  so it does not need treatment . 
i live alone and tend to avoid any complications in food prep and cleanup . 
that s one of the things that makes this powerlift battery so handy . 
good design !  would have liked something to hold the two funnels together . 
if i had know how useful it was i would have bought it years ago . 
it comes in two parts ,  a neoprene sleeve and and a hard case that snaps over it . 
the price was  right  and the delivery was on time . 
however it s so simple to just make another batch ,  so just do that instead . 
this was very easy to use and the perfect size for one or two . 
bought these as a gift and the recipient is enjoying them as well . 
it is substantial  heavy !   ,  magnificent and works wonderfully well . 
you can squeeze them ,  wring them ,  and then wash them out and let them dry . 
love this but it did cost about num_num num_num to shipcame new it is very soft and bright pink . 
as far as this having num_num quiet speeds i d have to say that is not quite accurate . 
it can be removed by shaking the press in a certain way but it s slow and tedious . 
i found one on amazon and ordered to see whether it would make a difference . 
i love farberware and this double boiler is a great addition to any cookware you may have . 
before i bought the polder digital probe thermometer ,  i had been using my taylor instant read thermometer . 
the side pocket fits many of my kitchen aid attachments . 
i used them around my fireplace and around my curio cabinet for twinkle lights . 
it does have an alarm ,  and you can change the ringtone among num_num presets i believe . 
most anything i can do in my toaster oven ,  i can do with this machine . 
my birds have never had such clean cages and the cage cleaning went so much faster and easier . 
i purchased an htc evo a couple years back . 
made bobby flay s recipe for pie crust with added garlic powder and dried basil to the mix . 
the stand holds my num_num inch tablet well . 
just remember not to fill this all the way . 
have not tried the camera button as again i use the software control . 
this one is the one i wish i d have bought in the first place . 
be careful; it is heavy ,  but it s a good looking piece . important to me :  made in u . s . a . 
i like it because it is possible to check on how food is cooking without taking the lid off . 
just received this measuring cup and it is great  !  just like the older ones we own . 
but you ll have a really slick device afterwards and a lot more free memory . 
i left them for an overnight charge and now they work with no errors again . 
i sure didn t want to buy a whole new mixer . 
though i have to say ,  this little gem is small handy and easy to clean . 
would   and have  purchased again . great protector for an older phone . 
this is a terrific addition to any kitchen . 
don t buy one with plated tines ,  the plating will flake off . 
this is easier to use ,  easier to clean ,  and cooks as well as the nordic . 
it is definitely better than it was but not where i was hoping . 
so i returned to the cyberpower ,  but without the base or vertical position . 
nicely browned and crisp on both sides ,  but soft in the middle . 
sometimes this pan is sold as a special .  .  .  ,  if you see it grab it . 
there is a dial on the front of the machine to control the amount of coffee desired . 
better than any stainless steel peeler i have had . 
i emptyed the container and fould all sorts of trash . 
this fit perfectly  it was a low end oster blender ,  $ or so  and the blender works again !  . 
the rubber head is stiffer and more sturdy . 
i never imagined it would hold up like it has . 
but the only negative effect is its really hard to see the screen in the sun . 
amazon review is incorrect in claiming that all rosle products are made in germany . 
i have bought several different brands of lightweight rechargable sweepers and this one is the best . 
it has allot of power ,  therefore i use it more than ever before . 
it s easy to read and simple to operate . 
it has a non slip strip on both sides so it is easy to pick up and not drop . 
of course pyrex is a long time favorite namebrand of mine . 
it s simple ,  minimal ,  design makes it a breeze to clean . 
my husband loves his pasta pot and he has even used it as a fryer . 
so happy to get back to real perked coffee and away from those plastic drip coffee makers . 
audio comes out of your car s speakers and the system automatically mutes music during an incoming call . 
i love to bake and i love to bake in something that sets off what i am baking . 
it also is less weight in the drawer and that s good for a drawer s longevity . 
purchased as a christmas gift for my daughter . 
i recommend it if you have an iphone without a cover . 
there is no head attachment so you must use this over the ear . 
this battery has a lot of lifetime and will last . 
they thought i was crazy ,  but now they all love it too . 
a lock for the cover ,  which i didn t need ,  but i could see why they added it . 
wish the handles lasted longer than num_num years though . 
my only complaint is that the assembly is a little tricky . 
my drawers are both longer and wider than this tray . next time it goes on sale ,  i m buying three more . 
i don t believe it would accommodate the extended battery however . 
it still keeps the phone slim but yet protects it from scratches and falls . 
some noticeable smells have been dramatically reduced and it certainly helped with allergies . 
great for making puddings and things you don t want to stick to the bottom of the pan . 
if you get the sandisk sansa fuze ,  this is a package you must have . 
my only complain is that it is too darn heavy but i guess cast iron skillets are all heavy . 
lodge makes one and it is available on amazon . 
i m looking forward to many more fondue parties with this product . 
you can t beat this filter for the money . 
i wish i would have had this stylus when i was setting up my new phone ,  passwords ,  registrations etc . 
it seems to be both well designed and madewith sturdy stuff . 
i would buy again . oh ,  i ve purchased wiring harnesses from scosche . 
and it can be used as a very handy weapon in case of intruders or bears . 
it should not have done that at all ,  right ?  well it did . 
i ve grown up using cast iron pans and here is the no bs truth . 
i bought these because they are compatible to my bunn coffee maker . 
holds only two cards but for five bucks to buy and ship i feel it is a great value . 
used it several times already and thankful for this . 
i ve tried num_num different cases and the ifrigze luxe is by far the best . 
the glitter comes off a little and the edges are not the best quality . 
this was well worth the money ,  it does a very fast charge in the car . 
you can leave the bottle on the table and not worry about the bottle getting cold . 
i ve been looking to replace my old oxo ice cream scoop for awhile . 
it is very pretty ,  heavy ,  and very well made . 
a lot more powerful than others that i ve had . 
i didn t care though ,  as long as it did it s job . 
it really makes scooping ice cream easier and more pleasant ,  even if it is frozen hard . 
the tower fits easily in the cabinet under my sink . 
i use my to use the hps function on my bike rides and runs . 
when my wife received her num_extend she was ecstatic . 
i like its use of the standard microusb connector . 
after a lot of research and also owning several other vornado products i picked this once . 
i love to bake and this is perfect for transporting baked good to potlucks ,  etc . 
i bought this one because my other brush is wearing out . 
i m just happy to be able to get the product !   . 
didn t use an insane amount of the spray . 
it has made my cutting jobs much easier . 
i have been using this knife every day for all those years and it still works great . 
put your waffle mixture in let it cook and it chirps again when they are ready . 
it was gone fast ,  then i tried the slightly dirty place at the entrance to my front door . 
the ones that do seem to bypass the cover no problem . 
i followed the directions that came with the wok and had good results . 
but the first one i got did not want to turn on . 
i tested it by sticking it to the windshield ,  without any cleaning or prep ,  and it sticks quite well . 
and amazon is not giving me anything to say this ,  it s just my honest opinion . 
compatibility with the ms office suite is a plus  no more dependence on data viz  . 
when they talk about less noise ,  this is very low in noise . 
since we had a plastic one cup measuring cup ,  i began using that . 
this is a nice and cheap replacement sync cable . 
i just ordered one of these to replace the one i have . 
the included spatula got all the food out of the work bowl quickly without making a mess . 
a great feature that i m surprised other manufacturers havent picked up on . 
i ve broken several phones from dropping them too much . 
this bowl is a must for every kitchen . 
this is the classic drinking glass throughout europe . 
once you cooked on cast iron ,  you will never want to use anything else . 
you ll drag out every knife and sharpen everything in your house after you use this thing once . 
this has to be the best $ shipping you can possibly spend to protect your investment . 
covered straining saucepans than this farberware ,  and i have . 
this is a terrific little vacuum if you have hardwood floors ,  tile ,  etc . 
they shattered the phone screen twice and spent a lot of money getting it replaced . 
i do not use this in my tub . 
since then ,  i have tried several and was happy with none of them . 
you can even put both in the same bag at once . 
who wants to leave the house with a headset with a minimal charge in it . 
cleanup needed only soap ,  water ,  and a dish cloth ,  and the pan looked like new . 
so i was able to take it back and grab another one . 
feels solid and heavy :  so that it sits on countertop firmly . 
it is sort of a puzzle to get on . 
when the beadboard and two prepac items were installed by my husband ,  the completed look was wonderful . 
i love my screen protectors and they fit perfectly on my phone . 
and it s hot ,  stands up to cold milk . 
it keeps my bluetooth out of the way and safe . 
it is my absolute favorite pot for making sauces and stews ,  and i use it often . 
the incredible s camera takes better pictures indoors and similar or slightly better pictures outdoors . 
the ability to stack them was a great space saver . 
love these !  they are absolutely beautiful in my kitchen . 
they themselves pointed out that the pot does make three espresso cups  worth of brew . 
it can be removed and added tons of times ,  and the ring never comes loose . 
it cooks evenly over two burners on my gas stove and cleans up easily with a little soaking . 
i like the cover for my wife but the bottom cover is discoloring and comming loose . 
i recommend this product to people who like to run and listen to music at the same time . 
however ,  i doubt very seriously this is an samsung oem item . 
if you frequently use olive oil ,  you need to buy this product !  . 
i think i have my $ worth though . 
the rice krispie treats i made were an enormous success . 
much better than having a standard blade grinder and with more capacity . 
oxo is a name that i equate with good products and i wasn t disappointed with this scraper at all . 
unfortunately the skin has to be removed when placing the galaxy tab in docking stations ,  etc . 
i remember when i was a kid and my parents got one of those electric can openers . 
easy to clean while still hot or warm with only hot water and a stiff brush . 
this product is well built and i am very satisfied . 
the microphone filters out % of the back ground loise . 
they are really beautiful and really do look very nice on my counter . 
this really does help if you are out in the sun during the day . 
easy to pair ,  control volume ,  answer calls and disconnect . 
it will give you a deliciously rich cup of espresso on the first try . 
other than the logo being upside down ,  you cant tell the difference . 
this case works perfectly with my zune num_extend
i can see years of excellent service in my future with this product . 
it speeds things up while allowing you to cook on medium . as for cleaning .  .  . it couldn t be easier . 
it s exactly what you expect ,  and gets better with every use . 
i like it fine ,  but it doesn t really work for the purpose for which i purchased it . 
i am totally thrilled to find this steamer . 
my iphone is two years old ,  but looks absolutely brand new coming out of this case . 
wanted to bake so i read some reviews and bought these based on what others said . 
it was just what she needed in her business . 
i use this one mostly for the grill where distance is an advantage . 
maybe all hot air poppers are loud ,  but this is the only one i ve had so i don t know . 
i use a dish towel under it so no problem . 
but the spatula is very handy and it works great . couldn t work in my kitchen without at least one !  !  . 
it does provide a lot of useful ,  pretty designs in one kit ,  which i like . 
 : o okay ,  perhaps i m being a bit silly ,  but my report is the same as the majority of others . 
great product ,  but if they lightened up on the tint would be five star . 
i hope to eventually use the rest of the set . 
i own several cuisinart brand small appliances and haven t been unhappy with any yet . 
no plastic smell and it s a very good size . 
there was a noticeable difference in my signal in areas i know i have little to no signal in . 
the battery took the charge and held it like new . 
i put them on the top rack of the dishwasher and they do not get warped by the heat . 
i get no lagg at all hardly watching youtube videos . 
life is wonderful and worth every penny  :   . 
easy to get your phone out in a hurry . 
they are great for those large soups and even for salads and pasta . 
excellent value but one stopped working within days . 
i was so delighted with the angelhair pasta like strands that sauted beautifully in some olive oil and garlic . 
i like that it came with a carry pouch . 
i use to store flavored waters or homemade coconut milk . 
i will not use any other glass containers than these bormioli rocco fido jars . 
i have many pieces from the chicago metallic line and am very happy with all of them . 
these cookie cutters have a selection for virtually every holiday ,  as well as every day in between . 
the weight is great and the grip comfortable . 
it still works ,  but it takes a lot more pressure . 
awesome price for a very durable ss skillet . 
the storage container and variety of sizes makes this a great value . 
it is the perfect platform for my new natural ,  latex mattress . 
i work with small pieces ,  and these were perfect for the job . 
they are not quite as cold as real ice but pretty close . 
it is so light and easy to handle . 
i m glad i purchased this and might be getting another one soon . 
i have the white one as well and will order it again when need another one . 
before we decided to buy ours and were glad that we did . 
love this case ,  protects my phone well ,  fits well ,  the color is a bit brighter than the pic . 
so i was happy to see amazon sold it !  i bought it and received it quickly . 
came in num_num weeks exactly ,  so far so good . 
i jus wish i could have gotten more for the price ,  like num_num instead of num_extend
bissell is about the best i ve found for quality cleaning !  . 
i like to buy this brand occassionally and have never had a problem . 
the jabra can announce the name if your phone supports num_extend no instructions marked on the unit itself . 
even if you have to drive clear across town  as i do  ,  i guarantee ,  it s well worth the effort . 
love that has a red light that turns on to let you know it has power . 
it works great for cooking meats and pancakes ,  but has one downside . 
also gets up dust and dirt ,  and even ice melt salt that is tracked in from our front porch . 
i usually have trouble putting these on but when on without a problem and it is barely noticable !  . 
they ve even help up well through a few dish washings . 
i guess that s just the nature of the human condition . 
we are watching our figures and this popper works great in the microwave . 
you take the lid off for the last num_num mins to crisp it up nicely . 
so far nothing has rubbed of of smeared and it still holds a good fit on my iphone num_extend
it is must have for people like me that don t know how to calculate things . 
i ve never drank the iphoney coolaid and don t ever want to . 
it is now a collectible and sold worldwide . my daughter was tired of her all white dinnerware ,  and requested fiestaware . 
i am personally very happy with it and intend to use it quite a bit . 
attach the hose to the sealer and the port on your foodsaver . 
i really like the cases ,  the color options ,  and the price was great . 
i m happy with this mandoline ,  glad i chose this one . 
however ,  i still have the one from the one i burnt out ,  and it still fits . 
i used to have a regular messaging phone that drained its battery like a smartphone . 
if you follow the directions ,  you will have excellent and easy to make spaetzle . 
i love the fact that music streams wirelessly to this speaker box . 
it would help if the grill part was removable to clean . 
fits and works just as well as the original carafe . 
great assortment of sizes ,  comes in very handy . 
that way ,  the rice is nicely separated and not starchy and mushy after it s cooked . 
i was happy to find it as my processor is aged but still fit . 
if your a heavy talker that maybe a day at least . 
the clip is nice so it can be hung . 
this thing is just the ticket for any kind of mixing . 
but they come out dry and often rather flat . 
i look forward to using it on long airplane flights or train rides . 
it is a breeze to clean and does not require soaking . 
it works great both ways ,  but without oil it is fluffier . 
my kids use it and love it works great on carrots ,  cucumber ,  ginger and apples . 
the small head gets up into the corners . 
my last frother died a few weeks back ,  and i wanted a quality unit with some power . 
these canisters can certainly help you get organized in the kitchen !  . 
this replaced the almost exact sharp convection microwave we bought back in num_extend
at some point i know my husband will use it . 
the item arrived very fast and looks just as pictured . 
the wood doors here have a fire retardant finish that marks easily and is extremely difficult to patch . 
they have rolled edges so there is no sharpness or need of aluminum tape . 
these are the best deal out there and run very long . 
i used to own big espresso machines ,  but they never made good coffee . 
they are deep front to back ,  but not top to bottom . 
some of our metal lids were starting to rust a bit . 
the battery life is ample ,  even for a heavy use day . 
in a deep medium bowl ,  beat the egg whites to stiff peaks . 
it plugged rapidly and lots of the smaller particles of tea made it through . 
it works well and is easier than scraping bits of dough into the pot . 
the tempered glass lid lets you see inside so you are tempted to lift the lid less often . 
call the company if you have any issues and i guarantee they will do their best to fix it . 
there is little that can go wrong with the cooker . 
what a great find this turned out to be . 
it did the job and was a good buy for what we need it for . 
the mounting options allows it to work for almost any situation . 
give this bluetooth a try if you want to sound like you re on a  regualr phone  . 
if you know how these sandwich grills work then you ll definitely love it . 
the design of the skydock s lighter plug makes it very stable and very difficult to remove . 
i will test with cake tester in more places next time . 
charger works with all micro usb phones mot and lg . 
i have been using it for several weeks now and have had no problems . 
it s wonderful for cooking a single serving of hot rice cereal in the morning . 
the clear part is actually clear and you can see even the detail on the back of the case . 
i ve yet to find anything of similar size and sound quality even close to $
this does indeed pop gourmet kernels with hot air only ,  and it does get hot . 
this rack is exactly what is needed for a big turkey or any big roast . 
i would definitely buy this again if i needed to . 
plug fits nice and tight on my galaxy num_extend num_extend also works with my nexus num_extend
so instead i use it as a neck pillow for when i am laying on my back in bed . 
the next one was stolen out of shopping cart at age two days . 
i was on a budget and found online an unlocked hp ipaq model num_extend
this stone is just like my old one which broke recently . 
i went to t mobile to buy a car charger and they wanted num_extend
it came early ,  works well and right for the price !  . 
compared to an android the screen doesn t have that kind of wooing num_extend
overall ,  good quality for the price i paid . 
you kinda have to fight with it alittle . 
the large plunger is indeed quite comfortable and it chops like a dream . 
they cuy through just about anything i have to work on . 
it s like a corded vacuum when running on full power . 
the grinder s overall shape is a kind of squat ,  slightly bulging cone ,  with a flare at the bottom . 
take some chocolate milk ,  cool whip and eagle brand milk . 
ya know ,  i ve had many renditions of this ,  but this one makes me very happy . 
lodge makes the best cast iron cookware and the price cannot be beat . 
these are solid ,  heavy crackers that should stand up to the hardest walnut or the biggest lobster . 
now i can eat even more banana bread !  . 
just turn down the burner to medium once the valve starts rocking . 
then i upgraded to color phones and tried the other motos . 
its still slim enough that it doesn t feel like you are carrying a brick around . 
easy to use and rolls out both crusts very evenly . 
these are part of a fine system that reliably cleans water . 
this food processor replaced the cuisinart of virtually the same design that i got for christmas ,  num_extend
i haven t actually used these yet ,  but i am very familiar with ateco cutters . 
so far the latch others speak of has not broken . 
i used this to charge my lg env touch phone and an num_extend player in the car . 
this can opener more than exceeded my expectations . 
you might consider it if you want a powerful and efficient heater that s not as loud . 
containers were a little smaller than expected ,  but worth the price . 
this makes cooking  well ,  the chopping part anyway  a pleasure . 
the shipping was faster than expected and they arrived in perfect condition . 
when cleaning with lye you have to be carful and not drop the lid . 
you peel off one of the masks and apply the screen guard to your phone using the plastic . 
it stores upright in cabinets to save space . 
i recommend this to anyone looking for a good spoon dish stand !  . 
this is the only armband i have found that fits the phone without having to take off the case . 
the inner silicone layer provides shock protection and the outer plastic layer keeps the case sturdy and slick . 
i can even grind spices in this baby without having to worry about  celery seed coffee  the next day . 
but ,  the set is well worth the price . 
more steps back ,  a few steps forward ,  but no other choiuce . 
has a hole in the bottom for paranoia checks  lol !   . 
i always can use extra cords for my cell phone ya know thank you amazon . 
i only use cast iron but my biggest pan was only num_num in . 
drain the gnocchi and place on a paper towel . 
this product is wonderful for biscuits or cookies alike due to the height of the cutter . 
however ,  it is in our bedroom and nobody will see it anyway . 
i usually have my phone plugged in if i m in the car for long to keep it charged . 
don t over fill with kernals ,  that is ,  don t go beyond the line they recommend . 
the alarm is loud enough to wake me without startling me . 
everyone i talked to said i should season it . 
this adds a little more space to my spice cabinet . 
this keeps the board in a pristine condition and should be considered necessary care for long life . 
and everything  besides the base ,  of course  is dishwasher safe . 
the screen is actually flat with the glass getting thinner in the middle to give the outside a curve . 
not ever using a burr grinder before i am not sure why this happens or even if it should . 
glad we did the research and bought it . 
problem is the part that breaks cannot be fixed . 
very close to the size and style of it and we have had no issues at all . 
all phone controls and buttons are easily accessible . 
i bought this popper after reading several negative articles about microwaved popcorn . 
some results were good ,  some poor and others just ok . 
great for swapping out in the middle of pastures while hunting . 
sound quality is good and quite loud on my galaxy num_extend
my husband loved this gift and plans on using it when we get home . 
it s just a really good ,  good cup of coffee . 
color is excellent ,  price ,  shipping time ,  and packing were good . 
it has a sleek design which i like . 
all in all ,  i really loved this phone when i had it . 
i decided on the uncoated version ,  since most of my recipes call for greased and floured pans . 
it works ,  it looks good and thats that . 
the defender is an excellent product and has defended the iphone from many a disaster . 
got rid of our older generation champagne capper for this one . 
i dropped my phone face down about num_num week after i received the case and it bounced . 
on the bottom and steamed the shrimp on the steamer rack . 
as many other reviews have emphasized ,  they re all natural and not needlessly bleached like other paper filters out there . 
i decided that i should get one of mine own . 
the bottle opener is also great for opening those stubborn soda bottles . 
this was after having two lesser models where the drive mechanism on the bottom simply melted . 
there seems to be too many perfectionists out there .  .  . just scramble and cook if ya can t get it perfect !  . 
we needed something to help chop their food and our food easier . 
i search for bargains and i m all about trying to save a dollar . 
a battery at the sprint store was $ i could buy many of these for that price . 
cuisinart thought about ease of use and implemented it well . 
after a week of drying out ,  it still works . 
it s minor ,  really ,  but if it annoyed me it may do the same thing for you . 
this is my second pair ,  i love them so much . 
just to be safe i do pour it over the sink . 
 the cast iron skillet cookbook  ,  by sharon kramis is great to go with this pan . 
don t pull it of when the phone is on ,  it does some thing to the sim card . 
i wish i would have purchased this sooner !  . 
background noise is not noticably reduced ,  and there is a noticable echo when walking in the mall . 
the evo is still amazing me after two months . 
i use this one for cookies and it is wonderful . 
i am thrilled with my kitchenaid mixer ,  the kitchenaid company ,  and always with amazon . com !  . 
it is one solid piece so you don t have to worry about it falling apart . 
soups and stews can be ready in a few hours instead of num_extend
it s the perfect size for large lemons and limes . 
i read some of the negative reviews and am not sure what these people got . 
the rest his touch system and processor is fast and sensitive . 
a cover would be very useful and a practical addition . 
i haven t had a problem since i bought them . 
i buy just this brand so i do not have trouble matching tops . 
i can steam num_num dumplings in my steamer in foil and they come out perfectly . 
if you re working on a feast ,  the removal of the cones while the attachment is installed is a snap . 
this should be available for all phones ,  because the higher the price the shorter the battery life . 
i had been looking for this product for quite some time . 
it holds a pretty decent charge when used for an iphone  haven t tried it on anything else  . 
best part is that the timer is digital . 
i didn t have any really dull knives so i ve just been using the num_extend stage . 
i got this for my brother and he uses it all the time in the car . 
this is a great little tool to keep around and not just for light laundry as one might think . 
the oster only had a crust setting that you could adjust for each num_extend
wow  !  !  !  how i wish that i had come across this  baby  a long ,  long time ago . 
i bought a few extra hooks ,  but only used a couple . the price is extraordinary for the quality . 
it sits vibration free on the counter while grinding . 
it paired and set up more easily than any other headset i have ever had . 
it works so well it seems to be designed with me in mind . 
i returned this strainer because i found one at the dollar store . 
the sounds come through perfectly and they block the noise from the gym . 
i have owned cases by otterbox ,  case mate ,  and so on and so forth . 
i have nothing but praise for this product and the delivery time was exceptional . 
the can be used for oils ,  vinegars ,  and soaps . 
i oiled it a year a ago when i first got it ,  and it s still looks great . 
not much else to say other than it makes coffee the way your want and quickly . 
i still have my miu num_num quart and love it . 
i do prefer the bleached filters ,  as i think the unbleached filters have a papery taste . 
the leftover oil is clear and not burnt ,  and so can be refrigerated for a couple days and reused . 
like slicing through butter ! quite frankly i would never abuse a fine piece of china nor a good knife . 
i don t need to say much abut protection . 
they were smaller than i would have thoughtthey would be . 
the timing mechanism will last a long time but the hinge on the counter stand is weak . 
the pocket is handy also to store book and favorite receipts . 
battery seems to be just as good out of the box . 
the powder mix was still in its original form . 
the charge was reported to be much better . 
these are sturdy and have been so useful for everything from birthday cakes and cheese cakes including casseroles . 
add to that the seasoning process and long term care required ,  i passed for years . 
i use this mount in conjunction with my evo num_extend phone which has a very large touchscreen . 
i bought this to grind herbs with ,  i was getting tired of crushing them . 
if you heat them first no stick to them . 
i mean ,  it s plastic ,  so how much could it cost to make . 
but i was able to put this on without error . 
there is some hidden material inside of the card slot that holds num_extend num_extend or num_num cards equally well . 
the  honestly ,  rather glorious  screen of the iphone num_extend shines through and colors are not affected . 
would recommend this to anyone who is still using the thunderbolt . 
there is a button which allows you to answer a call even while you are listening to music . 
the bagless design is efficient and terrific ,  and it has been a real pleasure to vacuum with this machine . 
even as a kid ,  there wasn t one in the house . 
i think some companies just have the right attitude . 
biceps .   however ,  after about num_num tries i can now easily start and open any can in the house . 
it s amazing to see all that dirt flow up and know it had been in the carpet . 
it took over a year ,  but began to showing rib marks on the corners revealing a white color . 
it spewed coffee grounds into the coffee which tasted weird and watery . 
the grinder seems to be very well made; it s metal and fairly heavy . 
it s so big it barely fits in the sink . 
it is fantastic ,  powerful enough to beat the heaviest dough and beat delicate egg whites to perfection . 
it s not a pretty sound ,  but hey ,  it s a buzzer . 
the machine will gurgle gurgle for a few minutes and then there will be coffee . 
guess what will be under the tree wrapped just for her ?  . 
i am pleased with these shears in every way . 
what is there not to love about paper mini muffin cups . 
the inbuilt voice tells you when it is turned on or off ,  and the fm transmitter frequency . 
the orville redenbacher popcorn also only left a few kernels unpopped each time . 
not exactly what you are looking for when using . 
simple machine that provides a simple service ,  hot tasty coffee . 
from start to finish it took about an hour and a half to make a batch of num_num ravioli s . 
pass them on to your grandchildren who can do the same . 
after reading the reviews i decided to purchase this one . 
the num_extend width closely matches the largest diameter pizza typically made at home :  num_extend
i have always liked braun  more consistently good than krups or cuisinart  for their design and ergonomics . 
some of the others would lose their connection when i paused my music for very long . 
it turned out to be the most useful item in my kitchen . 
the filter is very easy to clean and is always there and ready to do its job . 
when you are cooking ,  and in a bit of a time crunch the extra bowl can be so helpful . 
there was no scraping of the bowl needed during the mixing process . 
notes :  i paid $ for each jabra stone from an internet company . 
the price was a steal on gold box day . 
i took the time to examine many  high end  coffee makers . 
food tv also said the best peelers had serrated edges ,  which really makes a difference . 
they are very ,  very well constructed ,  sturdy and balanced ,  and do a great job on even the toughest foods . 
this is one of those times ,  but not in the manner your thinking . 
finally ,  i ordered this battery since mine was going dead and malfunctioning during the day . 
snug fit !  easy to put on and remove when needed . 
i simply keep topping the battery up whenever i m home and near the charger . 
as others have mentioned ,  the funnel tip is too wide to fit into a standard wine bottle . 
the one i am reviewing herein is for the samsung captivate smartphone . 
its strong ,  not delicate ,  which is good for a dispenser ,  and it dispenses soap good ,  and looks tidy . 
keep the flame within the diameter of the disc . 
sturdy ,  a little bulky like every otter box . 
black is my favorite color and it looks very professional on my phone . 
when i set the timer ,  the heat remains for a long time after it shuts off . 
no wonder ours arrived with the styrofoam pieces pulverized inside the box and the baker having experienced a chip . 
soda bottles ,  you will require num_num num_num oz . 
have tried my best to wear it out . 
love not having the cords getting tangled in car . 
my only regret is that i didn t buy it much sooner !  . 
after leaving at work all the time and not having a replacement i invested in another one . 
i m no coffee aficionado ,  but i ve got no complaints about this standard coffee maker . 
this item does what it is advertised to do . 
i have gotten the really cheap kind before and regretted it . 
is one large piece preforated and you tear along preforation that fits your machine width . 
i hope this seal is heavy duty enough not to wear out quickly . 
overall this product is a good investment and pasys for itself in one use . 
i have been % with the performance of this blender . 
speaker is excellent ,  fm transmittercons :  lasts for a year or so ,  mic is just ok especially on highways . 
i bought mine used and it works perfectly . 
fabulous !  the iron glides better than any other brand or other rowenta iron i ve ever used . 
finger prints show up on the case ,  but easliy can wipe away . 
this is a fabulous juicer and for the price it really can t be beat . 
i really love this case compared to the others i ve had . 
just be careful when rewinding so the cord doesn t get crimped and breaks the very tiny wires inside . 
have been used on icraps  don t like the ipad  ,  asus ,  motorola s and htc s with very good results . 
you can have navigation speak in your voice or in many languages . 
this solves the problem of battery life and adds extra grip to the phone . 
case is durable and phone can be removed easily an placed back into the case . 
i have a num_extend tip and found it to do the trick . 
of course ,  if you re serious about saving some cash . 
before i got this knife ,  they were using my butter knives to open shells ,  hence the bent ends . 
doesn t have a lot of power to slice through certain foods . 
she loves it and uses it all the time . 
i received my reconditioned waring juice extractor today . 
works great and good screens and is clear not blurry and works wonderful on the phone . 
next ,  why would they not turn on sometimes ?  i found this one by accident . 
the two ends of coiled area snap together . 
heat :  pro :  none con :  this unit does not have an additional heater in the system . 
this squeezes a hugh amount of juice in a short period of time and does it well . 
recommend only using one earbud when on the phone . 
i have been using these foodsaver brand rolls for several years . 
i bought this for my boyfriend who can be accident prone . 
the case i was using was given to me by my wife ,  after she upgraded to a different case . 
num_extend call sometimes dumps . good noise control on transmit . 
it does a fine job on scrubbing vegetables . 
they d be great to give a kid who is starting up their apartment ,  and fine for a bachelor . 
this was my first cooker and it worked great . 
something better than this needs to be implemented . other design flaws num_extend
i always use soap when i wash it . 
i love the way it fits and i think it will protect my phone . 
i stopped making and eating bread; i know am at my proper weight of num_extend
i normally leae them laying around in the car or on my desk . 
i received this a few days ago from amazon . 
i had an older htc and this puts it to shame . 
i really like it ,  except that it doesn t oscillate anymore . 
i d buy another one if the need arose . 
there are so many wonderful things to say about this mixer . 
i found this name brand version to be sturdy and well worth the purchase . 
it s a sturdy case ,  and the leather looks good .  .  . but still kinda has a cheap looking feeling to it . 
now i talk on the road all the time because the jabra makes it too easy . 
to clean the inside run alcohol through the unit . 
they last a long time ,  will be purchasing replacement gaskets here as i need them . 
the true test will be the item s durability and battery life ,  which only time will tell . 
in this slow cooker ,  it took about five hours to cook the potatoes before i could mash them . 
came as advertised and in perfect working condition . 
this is a really nice set of cookware . 
it simply gives you all the options you could want in a tiny package that is road ready . 
i love to use it for a quick snack for my daughter . 
it seems to be well constructed and should hang in there for the long run . 
there is also not a visible fill window on the outside of the coffee maker . 
very responsive and also very clear with the same resolution as the original . 
i did use the ceramic little pots on a taller butter warmer and they ran a nice even temperature . 
it comes with instructions and all tools needed to install on anything . 
i was less than thrilled when i dropped my motorola atrix the second day i had it . 
the belt clip swivels num_num degrees ,  so you can position your phone at pretty much any angle . 
works the way it should ,  no complaints here !  it was in great condition when i received it . 
i realize i could just buy a new battery and be done with it . 
i bought this tool to roll the dough for ravioli over the ravioli molds . 
overall for the price ,  this is a very solid product and saved me many times . 
glass is much cleaner and healthier than plastic ,  ceramic or painted bowls . 
we only rinse it off with warm water and let it dry . 
but ,  the stereo sound for my music is just fantastic . 
if you use a bottle opener ,  it bends the lid ,  making it unusable . 
there are several online recipies ,  and some in the book it comes with . 
my original num_extend battery was definitely bad since the charge lasted only a couple hours . 
all of my cuisinart pots and pans have the same qualities . 
they almost look like colored silicone inlaid in the plastic handle ,  but i m not sure . 
it far exceeds my greatest expectations ,  holding heavy jackets and coats without any problem . 
it s big enough to work really well for canning . 
not only does it save time ,  but it saves frustration . 
it s very close to the pictured color or a  lime  tone . 
this is the num_extend fibrox knife i ve ordered . 
you should decide which one you want before you buy . 
it has gotten the nickname ,   bee hive  in my house . 
my heavy stainless steel pots just take too long to heat . 
after a full nights charge i put it to the test ,  did all the things i bought it for . 
i ve got an ipad and an iphone and found this stylus to work well with both . 
i empty it after every two uses or so and we have three cats and a dog . 
the quality is wonderfull and well thought num_extend
since it has a curved front end ,  it fits very snugly over the surface of the wok . 
to me that sort of decor is a waste ,  but this is the best iphone num_num case . 
this is one of two essential tools for keeping your knives maintained in tip top shape . 
i love the purple color and it fits my phone perfectly !  it s soft and feels sturdy . 
make sure you wash your hands and clean the screen good . 
these are the knives i reach for everyday . 
the readout is far better than the previous machines i ve had . 
roll out the dough on the counter ,  then place it on the pan . 
this is a glass bottle for holding liquids . 
i ve only had this vacuum for num_num months but it s everything the other reviews said it was . 
i think it just depends on what your needs are . 
this case looks very nice and it fits perfectly . 
if i ever break it ,  i m gonna get me another one . 
solid ,  with thin flexible edges ,  good grip ,  easy to wash . excellent design ,  excellent execution !  . 
one scoop fills a regular size muffin cup . 
that alone was a sheer pleasure ,  not to mention the no fat and the crispiness of the bacon . 
this is a high quality machine ,  and our carpets are cleaner than they have ever been . 
purchased this for a new num_num year old . 
the earpiece provides good voice quality and people have said that the dvp s mic is clear . 
it stays shiny like new ,  cleans up easily ,  and is so useful for larger cooking needs . 
i ve decided to order a second set ,  so i ll have place settings for num_num guests . 
i used it to transfer my pictures from my dslr to my nexus num_num no problem . 
since i love to bake it seemed a natural . 
the cord works perfectly and is as long as the description says it is . 
fits well on the table and perks up the look . shipping was fast and it arrived in perfect condition . 
i use this to get my xbox controller plugged into my nexus num_num for gaming . 
it s small ,  easy to use ,  and easy to clean . 
great respect for all things made in america . 
build quality was spectacular ,  and this is definitely one of the best purchases i had made in awhile . 
since amazon didn t have any in stock i went looking and found the num_extend
but it fit my iphone num_num in this battery case . 
i then let it cool to num_extend which took about half an hour . 
it has many delicious recipes with clear and easy preparation instructions and times . 
they were fine once applied ,  but not perfect . 
i have used many different phone holders; this by far is the best . 
of course it arrived before the estimate date as posted by amazon ,  and it fits great on my arm . 
just to get the ball rolling ! this is my second time buying these . 
the mophie juice pack doubles as a protective case and provides extra battery time . 
so i took the plunge ,  and am glad i did . 
the rack inside this canner is truly designed for pint jars . 
for daily use it s hard to beat the quality for the price paid . 
games from my experience on android for the most part are not as polished as those on the iphone . 
overall ,  this is a good product and i would recommend . 
i bought my first chemex pot back in the num_extend and used it for years and years . 
we ve used this for months with no problems at all . 
just get it and put it in your bag or pocket for whenever you need it . 
april num_extend num_extend this is my second and final update . 
if you are looking to use it for one portion that is fine . 
could get one from motorola ,  they don t sell them anymore . 
i use it with my samsung galaxy num_extend
perfect size for adding some extra power to the num_extend
i will never waste my money on electric can openers again . 
i only have to recharge the icarrier about once a week . 
i had the invisashield screen protector before this skinomi and thought it was ok . 
i had one of these cases on my phone while i was visiting a museum  with stone tile floors  . 
there are no funny straps that hold it down on the corners ,  no magnets ,  no velcro ,  no elastic bands . 
you will have to plan for larger groups . 
the microplane grater is a shining example of the better mousetrap . 
i would recommend this coffee maker to anyone who enjoys a good cup or three of coffee . 
i love the practicality of flipping it open to start it . 
that said ,  it works perfectly for small amts of greens . 
i m thinking about getting another in a different color . 
he is also a fan of the clip wheres it to work ,  no issues . 
anyway ,  it works perfectly and it make wonderful bread . 
the handles are lightweight ,  hollow ,  and sealed ,  so no more shaking water out of the inside . 
there was no appliance abuse of any kind . 
since most all of the unit is metal ,  i suspect it will last for quite some time . 
my son s sniffles are significantly less the nights we actually remember to use it . 
i thought it was a great idea ,  would avoid sputters and splats in the microwave ,  so got one . 
so if you re going to buy this ,  purchase it from everyday low prices co . 
i still use the cheap expensive stuff from the grocery store but only for bouquet garni . 
it looks good ,  it s sturdy ,  and and it works fine . 
i love the three sizes of the measuring cups . 
the big selling point for me is the metal blade cage . 
it is super convenient ,  the perfect size for a muffin and fast . 
these covers work reasonably well ,  they keep heat in and prevent most splatter . 
i highly recommend this to anyone who needs a lot cooking capacity . 
i saved more than half the money buying it at amazon . 
completely satisfied with the num_extend after num_num months . 
after a while ,  i realized it wasn t working very well at all . 
the wide body is perfect for the onion and other once cumbersome wide veggies . 
i don t even have to peel the garlic . 
i got num_num for a huge discount over what verizon wanted . 
first off the package came in on time ,  very good packaging and the tools came with it . 
if you really need to chop large amounts of veggies in a hurry ,  look for a larger processor . 
delivery was timely  especially since the holiday season had begun  and the product great . 
so no using them in bed when laying on your back . 
i just wish it was easy to get things setup and get going . 
now i can plug my phone ,  gps ,  and customers phones in and charge them using this . 
i was searching for quality knives at a reasonable price that would last the rest of my lifetime . 
we noticed an immediate improvement in the flavor of the coffee with this style of grinder . 
it seems like when i m moving around ,  people think i sound gurgled . 
in five minutes or less ,  you have the most incredible coffee ever . 
i know with certainty i used similar products many ,  many years ago . 
the scissors are lightweight and small ,  but they are well balanced and sharp . 
other than that ,  the i m pretty happy with it . 
i would recommend it for anyone with the same situation . 
some of the small plastic parts can be tricky to handle . 
the impact weirdly leaves a little room between the side of the screen and the case itself . 
i chose this because ,  compared to the griffin air curve ,  the price was amazing . 
not too soft nor too abrasive ,  just what i needed . 
after every pour i have to wipe the drops running down the side . 
this is a perfect set and i cannot wait to start using them in my kitchen . 
good tool in the kitchen for low fat diet . 
i just had some perfect bacon for breakfast ,  cooked on this pan in my microwave oven . 
my phone looks really covered now without being a fat mass . 
it s easy and fun to use and the yogurt is delicious . 
oh ,  sometimes the little yellow indicator sticks up ,  so it looks like it s at pressure but it s not . 
the headphones are covered but open up when needed . 
i could give it five stars on the functional part alone . but the form factor killed me . 
i have two dogs so i would have expected more . 
simple sturdy product that does what its supposed to . 
i bought this because it was a good price for a thermal coffee pot . 
the one i received was not as flimsy as others described . 
the comfort is the absolute best i have tried . 
i used some needle nose pliers to pull out the clogged debris . 
we live in the woods and could only get a roaming signal . 
i didn t actually realize it when i bought them ,  but they are full featured phone headsets with mics too . 
amazon had the best price ,  and as always the service was great . 
found it to be very sturdy and does exactly as expected as advertised . 
the tempurature in my room dropped from num_num degrees to num_num within a half hour . 
if you place the antenna too close to the amplifier ,  it flashes red to indicate it s not working . 
imagine his dismay when the former owners did not leave it with the house . 
sleek ,  compact ,  portable ,  effective ,  easy to use ,  infinitely adjustable ,  high quality materials . 
i am blown away at the level of service that i was provided from westbend . 
just sooo much easier then dealing with the num_num part metal lids . 
but ordered on the faith of raves from the other reviewers . 
got it rather quickly  love amazon prime  and the case performs very well . 
they hold their edge well; but i do use a tool to keep the edge true . 
the food has a nice smokey flavor indoor cooking can t provide . 
i am glad i chose this one when i was debating on which one to purchase . 
i passed it up on amazon many tmes . this is a well made board . 
when it finally broke  the plastic not the inner workers  i was in the market for another one . 
they are easy to clean if you don t let the dough dry on them . 
i have purchased several wall maps for her bedroom and dorm room as well . 
but for emergency or occasional use you cannot beat it . 
my son uses this case and it has protected his htc phone great . 
if you ve never experienced fresh pasta ,  you don t know what you re missing . 
my mom uses this stuff ,  has for years ,  and none of here dishes are scratched or chipped . 
shun makes the best kitchen knives i have ever owned ,  bar none . 
the color is a really pretty iridescent shade of magenta ,  and it fits very snugly on the phone . 
it charges very fast and seems to have a good life between charges . 
most significantly ,  it cost half as much  or less on one i bought black friday week  . 
it was slow grilling the meat and helped the meat retain some of its moisture . 
the pod prices can very slightly ,  however ,  the shipping charges are what make the difference in the final cost . 
i make these bundt cakes and give one to each piano student the week of their birthday . 
i never have issues with pouring from this shaker either . 
it is a good purchase for the price and shipping was really fast . 
some people settle down with cheap cases from ebay . 
i tried many other products ,  but nothing was comparable to the froth au lait . 
so much better than what we thought we had ordered . 
i like the weight of it which is heavy and i am positive this will not bend or dent . 
luckily i don t care about bt and it would just use more battery . 
before ,  i had to spray with urine nutralizer and blot up with paper towels . 
she has been bugging me about not having a case so i search the big a . 
 you can still make small amounts in the larger size .   i am giving my old one to family friens . 
i ended up using it for months on end . 
under cabinet mounts are double the price and most are digital with labels like  pizza  . 
i have used it more times to poke holes on leather for sewing . 
i am very glad that i took the plunge and ponied up for this press . 
this fan is easy to put in and take out of your window ,  lightweight . 
i ve owned at least num_num different toaster ovens over the years . 
purchased num_extend one for each socket in my car . 
then my email didn t get picked up on ,  then the num_extend email was misread . 
i sometimes use a bit of oil ,  sometimes not . 
the reidels have been moved to the back of the cupboard . 
i don t know if that will happen again . 
the num_extend day was similar to the first . 
we purchased num_num for the kid s rooms so they could lock up their personal stuff . 
this is the same type of case as on my smartphone . 
coat the pan with lard ,  bacon grease or crisco inside and out and wipe off the excess . 
but for day to day activities it is comfortable and stays on securely . 
the capresso arrived ,  i unpacked and used it to make my first brew . 
num_extend it suffers from interference with other bluetooth devices . 
this headset has good sound ,  not great ,  but audiophiles aren t going to go bluetooth anyway . 
hard to say if that is bb or the headset . 
i love making sandwiches with the meat sliced thin and piled high . 
i can t say enough about my mighty mite . 
this is well worth the money it is simple yet very solid and well built . 
stock battery would also cause my phone to overheat which probably helped contribute to massive drain . 
i have one of these and actually bought this for my sister because she wanted one . 
i gave this to my son ,  having the slightly less nifty version of the same shape in another brand . 
just don t try to over tighten the cover . 
i purchased this case on amazon because it was the cheapest option . 
this case is pretty awesome ,  he phones stays charged for quite a long time . 
my husband is the one who read the book and knows how to connect ,  reconnect ,  yadda yadda . 
i tried to change it to num_num degrees . 
i ll add a picture to show how i use it . the led light is moderately useful . 
considering the price ,  and that there are five of them ,  i m well satisfied . 
this works great !  makes it so easy to get out the cork !  dr . 
it s comforting to have at hand ,  just in case . 
so i don t know how it would stand up to firmer foods . 
had it for a month now and dropped my phone a lot ,  still no scratches . 
it does not fall out but if you wiggle it just right it disconnects the charge . 
we are basically happy if it cuts decent at all . 
keeps the smaller pieces from falling through conventional grates . 
i have enough minutes to last me a year and then some . 
i actually prefer its simplicity and wouldn t trade it for a multilevel selector . 
bought this to use with galaxy note and can confirm that it works . 
i do like how it cleans up so easily and it conducts heat quite well . 
i d prefer a wider shallower bowl for tossing salad ,  hand mixing of bread or meatloaf . 
have two sets of these ,  one in black and this white model . 
they all fit onto a plastic ring ,  and can be easily pulled off for separate use . 
the dyson num_extend happens to be the best vacuum i have ever owned . 
sound plays through my speakers loud and clear ,  so i couldn t be happier . 
i cut it to fit my pizza stone . 
nonetheless ,  good price ,  good quality ,  and great looks !  . 
it was a great buy of a quality product . 
i ordered another hunter from amazon ,  and i guess this is the one they want me to review . 
i use mine quite often ,  both as a griddle and a grill . 
i would recommend this product to anyone that loves to cook . 
it s easy to recommend this pan with the results i have seen . 
the color and amount of crema is consistent . 
it probably takes less time than that but i never bothered to experiment further with the time . 
we use the bowls all the time and have owned them for years . 
we discovered this type of product several years ago . 
the musical quality of the num_extend is excellent . 
she had a hard time hearing me while driving in the rain . 
no more straining ,  no more crumbling corks with bits floating in my glass . 
watch the price on this item if you re not in a rush . 
the oiled surface helps the performance of cast iron cookware . 
perhaps moreso than the expensive iqair i ve got already . 
the maker s footprint is very small ,  an important feature in my galley kitchen . 
so far it s great and i m happy with this purchase . 
it took a lot longer than i had hoped to actually blend everything evenly . 
they are great ,  easy to use and very convinient . 
it doesn t take that long to have full charge but i still leave it on whole night . 
and it fits in your dishwasher !  yeah !  i don t know why i waited so long to buy this . 
it will charge your iphone at least num_num times . 
just get this scoop if you want one that will last . 
starting from the edge of the plate ,  make a circle covering that area with slices that overlap slightly . 
you simply keep them honed with a steel . 
this santoku blade retains its sharpness for a long time depending of course on use . 
i like the case and it works well . 
if you need an apple corer ,  this one works very well . 
it makes hashbrown type potatoes too and it s very adjustable . 
update :  june num_extend num_extend just paired this device with my apple ipad . 
macro lens is great ,  i wasn t expecting it to take pictures from that close distance . 
this is one of the few models that fits on your ear ,  not in it . 
i bought this tuna press from amazon two years ago ,  and it s still one of my favorite kitchen items . 
only downside is the wiping it off thing . 
unfortunately ,  once that is on ,  the droid x no longer fits . 
my phone even seems to run faster after changing from my water damaged battery to this new one . 
i live in an apartment and this is great for that lifestyle . 
flour  as the vacuum process sucks some of the flour up and under the lid ,  making the seal inefficient . 
you ll get slower speeds but it will work worldwide . con : no chance to upgrade os . 
i have a good collection of these now and expect to get many years of service out of them . 
i now use this as my daily alarm clock . 
too bad i waited to find this out . 
the bunn had a well that held water at a certain temperature for a fast pot of coffee . 
it s hard plastic and snaps on to the phone . 
trust me .  .  . you will be glad you bought it !  !  !  . 
if you do this with the cabernet glass it just wobbles around like an egg . 
i have emailed them several times with questions and they answer me the next day with great explanations . 
it will hold about two cups of flour . 
hope to have filtering water for six months . 
bought some extra to go with my dehydrator . 
i assume you are reading these reviews because you like the styling of this product . 
this was the first attachment i bought for my kitchen aid . 
the product is very well made and the packaging was awesome . 
bass response is good enough ,  but didn t expect body thumping bas from headphones like this . 
the volume and power buttons are covered by the silicone portion and work perfectly fine as well . 
this is a really good knife especially at the price . 
i know these will be around my kitchen for a long time . 
it was easy to use and his phone looked brand new after the replacement . 
i use the fuze and my wife uses the iphone . 
but aside from that ,  this is basically all i could ask for . 
i love my new hoover flair !  we have hardwood floors . 
in the past all my others sets i would have to recharge ,  not this one . 
works so much better than the kitchenaid scoop i bought at a local store for almost twice the price . 
i loved it right up to the point my dog ate it . 
i liked this product so much ,  i ordered a second one . 
my only peeve with these is that i like cups that nest well ,  and these are a little tricky . 
the quality is great ,  i ve dropped my phone once already with this case and my screen was fine . 
so far the battery does what i want it to do keep my evo running longer . 
this thing is made out of plastic ,  not steel ,  but that is obvious by looking at the photo . 
being stainless steel ,  the surface is very smooth and hard . 
the speakers and usb port cutouts on the bottom are perfect . 
i don t know how long the coffee stays hot because i don t drink it from the original mug . 
at first glance ,  this product seems not as expensive as it looks in the picture . 
works just as good as the apple ones and you can t beat the price . 
overall i love and highly recommend this steamer !  . 
what more is there to be said ?  well done oxo !  . 
i have not had any incidents of the phone slipping out of this holster . 
i love the fact that i can involve my num_num year old in the process . 
i highly recommend the moka pot for anyone who like espresso !  . 
easy to install and adds a lot of peace of mind . really affordable protection ! thank you !  . 
this mixer absolutely makes a difference in the end product . 
do keep in mind the durability is not amazing ,  as expected given the price . 
i am using the set for the last num_num months and i love it . 
 rachel  wasn t available ,  but another rep told me the serial number was one of the newer mixers i wanted . 
you have a choice of scalloped edge or flip it over and use a straight edge . 
in a remote area of africa ,  i have num_extend and no dropped calls . 
by far ,  however ,  the determining factor for me is the cleanup . 
it feels slightly rubberized and softer than the other candy shell cases . 
the carpet was looking good and after five minutes it stopped . 
i don t talk on the phone much and only put it on when i am in the car . 
its colorful ,  and the case seems to help with cushioning the iphone . 
drip coffee drinkers :  drink carefully and drink early ,  unless you want to watch the newest infomercials . 
i have been wanting to write about this machine since i got it about num_num mos . 
the manufacturer is not required to provide the latest update . 
this is a nicely heavy pounder with a good ,  grippy handle . 
and ,  after receiving it i called presto direct and found they have replacement cords at a very reasonable price . 
i look forward to finding recipes and making more yogurt . 
i would highly recommend it for the price . 
i suggest it for anyone looking for something . 
they get a goodgrip on the food without putting indentationsinto it as regualr tongs do . 
i really enjoy this unit ,  for the simple fact that it is a dual speaker . 
it just magically picks up everything and blends it to num_extend
it looks great ,  holds heat well with the lid on ,  and cleans up easily . 
the handles are metal so they don t break or melt . 
i use this with iphones in our home . 
if you own a deni foodsaver these are the bags to get . 
both ice mold cracked at bottom within a few weeks . 
the product is affordable and it works fine . 
it is easy to assemble and works beautifully . 
i am using these on tile in the shower . 
i hope i can get the one piece edition . 
as the reviews say there is a design flaw . 
this knife stood out as one of the best knives and at a fantastic price for the value . 
overall ,  i think this is a great little processor and well worth the price . 
i ve had a number of cases for my iphone num_num so far and this is by far my favorite . 
the best part is that it can be put in the dishwasher when the inevitable kitchen grease collects . 
for those reasons alone ,  this product deserves five stars . 
just what i ordered and the shipping was very fast . 
my aunt loves it and still rocks it with purple to this day !  . 
one screen protector has lasted me almost a year with no problems or significant bubbling . 
they ll already be there . voice dialing :  unfortunately the htc sensation doesn t have voice dialing . 
the sound quality for both music and voice was fantastic . 
really adds to the experience of craft beer !  . 
i ve been using this popper for over num_num years . 
i personally prefer the grand prix ,  but this is an issue of personal preference . 
every time i buy a kitchen appliance ,  i wonder ,   will it work without wheat ?   this does so ,  beautifully . 
i now have a tpu case which isn t as beautiful but definitely offers superior protection . 
i ve had it for more than num_num months and works perfectly !  i would highly recommend it . 
the one pot was defective but the other one wasn t . 
first off ,  the flat black backing makes it less slippery so if it doesn t slide around . 
i never had any issues with it  unlike a few other ronco products  . 
i want a earphone with mic that is cheap for travel . 
for the price i definitely think it s worth it if you re interested in something simple and not too bulky . 
it is made from extremely high quality stainless steel . 
then i forgot about it for a while . 
i don t think you ll be sorry if you buy it .  .  .  . just remember ,  open on the side !  . 
mic is overwhelmed by the num_num to num_extend of ambient background noise . 
the sticker that came with it made trimming my normal sized sim very easy . 
they are also great for holding home made rubs from mixed spices . 
i will install using screws instead of the hooks for peace of mind . 
there is so much froth it is still in the cup after the coffee is gone . 
they are wonderful ,  work perfectly ,  arrived quickly ,  and at a decent price . 
i find these a much more useful size than the stock num_num oz . 
i got the smaller version which is the new trent itorch . 
this popcorn maker was given as a gift . 
i also like the usb port on the side so it doesn t stick out from the wall so far . 
the edges at corner would not let it work . 
it works great for most moderately sized hardcovers and paperbacks . 
it has a lot of parts and is hard to clean . 
it comes in a paper box so there s no frustrating packaging to cut open . 
the little tab on the lid that you push to grind falls off often ,  which is annoying . 
the furniture was fairly easy to put together . 
i use coconut oil and sea salt for a healthier alternative to the flavor packets and it works great !  . 
it probably would last longer if i drained and dried it daily . 
very easy to use and clean up is a breeze . 
i ve used some other large ones that are really horrible to look at . 
i melted the lid to my kitchenaid blender in the dishwasher and they sent me a new one free !  . 
working during these cold winter days was a grind . 
i was going over range restrictions ,  safeties and stuff but that would make a long review longer . 
i ve been baking for over num_num years and know a good pan when i see one . 
with the updated design ,  i have not noticed a problem with bending handles . 
use this at least once a month ,  and after six years the finish is still perfect ,  nothing sticks . 
this was my main concern when i was debating whether to get the grinder . 
magnetic flap is very secure but opens easily . 
i have fought with other ones over the years and still had air bubbles underneath . 
it feels like wonderful quality and i really like it . 
it was larger  so could get stinkier  and the top part broke relatively quickly . 
when it s off the phone ,  it feels brittle ,  but it isn t . 
is it more expensive than others ?  yes ,  but it seems well worth the price . 
i am very happy all the way around with this purchase . 
first let me say i travel a lot . 
after moving i could not find my old sharpener so i went out looking for a steel . 
i no longer need a liner for the basket . 
price was right and i got it on time . 
no more smoky pans just nice clean popcorn . 
cooks with electric ranges might get better results with their more radiant burner system . 
this grill is definitely made to withstand the out door grilling . 
either way your air is going to be cleaner and you ll have fewer problems with allergies . 
i highly recommend it to anyone with the bold num_extend
i have several window fans around my home . 
it works like a charm and cleans up in the dishwasher or just rinsing with hot water . 
they have easy grip handles made out of rubber . 
i am very happy with my purchase of these scoops . 
these will hold up to some tough home use . 
second ,  when pouring water or coffee ,  there are no side spills or dripping . 
it s nice to see this quality in kitchen tools . 
i had an old phone that used a plantronics num_extend headset . 
i ve had it for a few months now and had no problems . 
i would buy this product again and recommend it to others . 
i am replacing all my cheapo stuff with glass . 
the steel is of great quality and hasn t rusted at all . 
the cover stays on the iphone perfectly and allows to lay the iphone face down with full screen protection . 
i always seem to lose my orange peeler . 
would have given it a num_num if the sides were not so high . 
i called my mother the other night ,  and we spoke for about num_num hours straight . 
but after year of use no problem of such kind . 
for people with poor vision or poor manual dexterity or arthritis ,  this probably isn t the right storage product . 
my mom had a similar item for draining tuna can juices . 
charging for battery that  s not so good .  .  !  i ll be thinking for next time .  .  !  . 
these are the best shears out there !  this will be our third pair and is for our camp trailer . 
i use this almost everyday and love it !  . 
hours later ,  it s still steaming ,  and the flavor has been preserved in a sort of suspended animation . 
it is really comfortable to hold ,  the blade is sharp and pivots really well . 
i m using the case with the iphone and placing it in the seidio innocase holster . 
i ve had them for a few months and have only had to use num_num so far . 
i got the black one ,  they pick the color for you . 
very bright light that reflect from the don . 
the size of this screen fits all my skillets . 
the waffles cooked perfectly ,  but boy were they strange !  !  kind of gritty from all that sugar . 
it shows some shortcomings with heavy doughs ,  and particularly kneading large batches of bread . 
we have two different plantronics headset and it holds perfectly with both units . 
i m leaving mine sealed up the way it is . 
overall it does a good job and cuts down on my food prep time ,  which is what i wanted . 
however the brand still ranks high according to consumer reports . 
i have tried cleaning it off but it still shows up . 
it does not get in the way of any buttons nor the qwerty slide . 
nearly every kernal popped ,  and there was no burning . 
i ve had it for a couple months and love it . first ,  it does get hot . 
but i guess you have to pay to play . 
the size is perfect for sauteing several pieces of meat without crowding . 
those quibbles aside ,  for the price i have no problem reccomending this case . 
there are tips for baking ,  leveling ,  torting ,  filling and icing the cakes . 
the size ,  shape ,  and ease of use of this measuring bowl is perfect for our kitchen . 
i have since moved to a different house and the size is no longer an issue for me . 
i ve been wanting to get this pan for a long time . 
it is easy to fill ,  and empty the dirty water solution . 
they have a decent battery time of over num_num hours of music listening and the sound quality is excellent . 
so far ,  i have no complaints for the charger . 
it has temperature settings ,  for correct temperature cooking and see through cover work great . 
man ,  i m thinking of selling these precut shoestrings to my neighbors . 
it s attractive ,  as much as any such product might be . 
the person i ordered it for really liked it said it was everything they wanted in a carrying pouch . 
the storage case is a nice and convient . 
actually it looks newer than the store demo models . 
without the case the iphone would have been history . 
the best steel in the world for edge holding is high carbon . 
this can be a good thing  electronics can break  ,  or bad  not as precise  . 
i have had this pot a few months now ,  and so far . 
it doesn t have  i assume  all the latest ,  coolest features ,  but i don t really want them anyway . 
buy one for the wife and make her happy !  !  . 
very simple way to heat corn on cob direct from freezer . 
callers say they can hear me fine without noise interference . 
this nicely wedges in ,  the a turn and the cork is out easily . 
the reusable filter fits like a glove ,  so if yours doesnt fit perfectly there might be reason for problems . 
i use them to get noodles out of the pot and for frying . 
it s fantastic !  the juicer attachment did not work as well as we would have liked . 
i m not disappointed; a couple of swipes and my knives are sharp and ready for duty . 
the larger whisk does most of the work . 
but ,  as this is secondary way to use the device it is not too much a problem . 
yup its pretty light weight as a few folks have mentioned .  .  .  . but its popcorn . 
easier to fit in a coat pocket once folded  the jawbone doesn t num_extend
has protected my screen from scratches these past two year . 
this is very streamlined ,  and is comfortable to wear . 
and yes it is unlocked and i am using this phone right now in germany  on a german network  . 
wet it ,  clean it ,  and just walk away . 
the clip seems to work a lot better than other cases i ve had over the years . 
i love sprinkling the mixture over brownies or a cake prior to baking instead of using frosting . 
i use whole wheat flour when i can ,  which creates a denser dough . 
i switched from using a keurig for my everyday coffee to this french press . 
the new one doesn t have that problem and works very well . 
if you love pizza ,  then you definitely need this cutter . 
in my estimation ,  the best food processor on the market  for a reasonable price ,  that is  . 
just use warm water and a light scrubing pad to make sure the pan stays seasoned . 
as there was no longer an odor seeping up from the toilet bowl . 
i was easily able to transfer music and files back and forth to the phone . 
i love that it comes with a screen protector cause that way you don t have to buy it seperatly . 
be forewarned that initial use of a filter will leave black specks in your water . 
steams up my room and helps me with my allergies and dry skin . 
early arrivals got their own cutting board and knife and were put to work . 
you just have to get used to the dead sound when no one is talking . 
expensive for what it is ,  though ,  and there are no washable versions of it . 
i lost my old earphones for iphone num_extend
it is plently powerful ,  easy to clean ,  and looks nice too . 
this device does so much of what i wanted it to do and a lot more . 
then i put the container in the refrigerator . 
you can choose a time between num_num sec and num_num sections or  never  . 
the supplied headphones don t sound too great ,  not much bass . 
i can t drink regular beer and i just have a small glass at a time . 
i just stick them to the fridge  magnets  and always know where they are . 
i made the best batch of hush puppies when i used this . 
note :  these are appropriate for portions suitable for num_num or num_num people . 
remember ,  these are manual type cutters that do require patience and safety issues . 
not of the highest quality but very good knife at a good price . 
i have never had problems with my christy renaissance towels . 
i can t remember the last time i used my cd player . 
i have not had a chance to try wines yet . 
these came quickly ,  they were inexpensive and every thing that was described about them appears to be true . 
even despite the glowing reviews ,  i wasn t tempted to get one of these . 
i live on the num_extend floor and i don t have to carry water up in the elevator anymore . 
plus ,  i got some apps that were on the iphone app store on the android one . 
great product ,  great price .  .  .  . a welcomed addition to my kitchen . 
i ve used num_num of them now and none have ever fallen off . 
second ,  i can use one for lemonade and one for iced tea . 
no static issues and got it to pair with two devices on the first try . 
ive used this screen num_num times now and they worked perfect . 
it came with a really nice set of accessories ,  and they even have their own great little storage box . 
don t put in dishwasher though ,  make sure to hand wash and dry right away so they do not rust . 
it s good enough to make me forget about all the phallic stuff about the name and shape . 
pour into the cups ,  place them into the maker ,  cover it and set the timer . 
so if you are willing to live with the fundamental flaws ,  then this case is as good as any . 
it s a safe ,  manageable appliance for introducing kids to cooking as well . 
canned salsa and tomatoes ,  and it was great . 
i grill steaks in my lodge logic grill pan and have these heating in the oven . 
if you don t ,  you will probably need to buy new ones . 
they re not bose quality but ,  these are definately a homerun for the value . 
i even put them in the toaster to crisp them up a little . 
there are some rough edges .  .  . after all ,  this is a chinese product . 
i have thought and thought and buying this ,  i really needed a new room divider . 
sturdy metal construction with taut metal wires well secured into the frame . 
i have the older model  bought it num_num yrs ago  and it still works perfect . 
regarding smudges :  i couldn t stand all the oils from my fingers constantly smudging the screen . 
this thing works great and i shake my head to think i used to mince garlic by hand . 
it is equivalent to a heavy duty shredder with the convenience of a light weight and an ergonomic handle . 
loved mine so much ,  i bought several for christmas gifts for family members . 
it is bit smaller in size but is perfect to use making smaller cakes and it is quite handy . 
also ,  don t leave water sitting in the pan for long periods of time . 
they cap wide mouths jars for every day use . 
i d seen some cast iron in stores and didn t much like what i saw . 
that is ,  until the sides of it started pulling apart  mirror side and sticky side  . 
he said this one is a lot quieter . i love it . 
once when driving it cut out for a few seconds and came back on . 
this is the best ,  easiest and fastest can opener i have used . i will never buy another kind again . 
i was very pleased when this arrived quickly and worked perfectly . 
then there s the voice entry ,  the best you could say is that it s not good . 
the pot is lightweight ,  as is the lid ,  and takes up less room than a stone pot . 
so .  .  . when the water starts to taste a little funky ,  change your filter . 
i never thought i d find a bluetooth to be better than a wired connection ,  but it just happened . 
the pot is well mad , e with a solid porcelain finish . 
i m no audiophile but anyone can discern full ,  rich sound from poor ,  tinny sound . 
this is one of very few kitchen pans i use . 
that guard thing that comes with the mandolin it is worthless . 
here s how to get the most out of it . first ,  put it it a pot of boiling water . 
i don t think i d be concerned about it . 
tons of room to work with and movies look great . 
love that it is longer than the normal cable . 
this atlantic cd storage rack makes attractive cd storage a reality . 
i m enjoying my grill ! update :  marinated chicken turned out perfect and turkey burgers ,  too . 
great if you feel like eating in front of the tv . 
revere handles are punched into the pan ,  when they pop off ,  that s it . 
now the part that made me fall in love . 
i exchanged my num_num cup presto for the num_num cup ,  the num_num cup brewed inconsistent batches ,  and weak coffee . 
the stand saves a lot of space and keeps this little tool clean ,  dry ,  and handy . 
much better than my old ones of another maker that did bend . 
i bought this coffee maker after seeing the high marks it received in cook s illustrated . 
mine arrived damaged due to poor packaging on anchor hockings part and amazon is sending a replacement immediately . 
they are first rate ,  high quality knives with a substantial casting and good sharpness out of box . 
so only run it on high when you re not home . 
i m always stuck trying to tape them back together . 
that ,  and we had to buy a new industrial cookie sheet . 
it s also pretty loud ,  so i need to make it during commercial breaks . 
i still need a good handle ,  even on a small knife . 
i excitedly opened my package as soon as it arrived . 
an experiment with fresh soda pop ruined the orignal fizz of the soda and made a low fizz . 
initially ,  it would just shut itself off immediately after brewing . 
it took about num_num weeks before it came in . 
great block for a lot of big knives like the excellent shun knives . 
i m not sure what magic properties some of the folks expect a simple coffee filter to have . 
several reviewers posted that the num_num does not have a permanent hepa filter . 
so i was pleased to find this bowl . 
the cans are different than they were years ago . 
after looking on the manufacturer s website ,  i am unable to verify the dimensions of this thing . 
i was surprised though that it only had one lid when it came with two pitchers . 
i love the convenience and healthy aspect of the presto power cup microwave popcorn popper . 
our family loves this press . be well cook well !  . 
the apple iphone num_num is one of verizon s best all around smartphones . 
pro+ has mute num_extend streaming only works on the first device the num_extend connects to . 
my bf got me onto using these glass bowls . 
i find i put less butter when soft . 
i have several pieces of bake ware i some times use for serving as well . 
whenever i use this for a phone i have to yell at it and people cannot always hear me . 
i purchased two fans for my two most smokiest rooms and they get the job done . 
what i like the most about the case is that it s one piece . 
by pumping all the air out of the bottle my wine stays fresh . 
i bought this one because it was cheaper and i needed num_num timers . 
this is a nice sturdy corer; i wanted one like my grandmas but this one works as well . 
i actually have the zerolemon extended battery and i was afraid this wouldn t fit . 
overall these headphones are packed with features and style for a very low price and well worth it . 
i would be careful if putting a screen protector as well . 
this is a great bowl for food preparation . 
we have one at home and i got one for the lake place . 
well ,  it started to get more and more frequent over the last few weeks . 
she wanted something that would quickly warm a cup of water for her without too much mess . 
i bought this pan about a year ago ,  and i use it every single day . 
i bought this for my breville oven and it fits the oven perfectly . 
but it works ,  and that is all that matters for this cheap of a price . 
i was relieved and am happy they worked out . 
i looks good ,  feels good in my hand ,  and doesn t cost much . 
neither issue would be a worth removing a star for . 
it s leaps and bounds past num_extend and even better than android . 
i will often put the library books we bring home in the closed bedroom to minimize any reaction . 
i was very worried but most everything went well . 
it is very easy to use ,  and the carpet dried in no time at all and looked very nice . 
if you want a solid ,  normal steel ,  this is it . 
it s dishwasher safe too ,  though our dishwasher doesn t get it as clean as i would have hoped . 
it also has a connection for micro usb and usbwhich allow you to charge two devices at once . 
i was unsatisfied with the quality of microwave popping and wanted a new solution . 
i d say it s well made . cons :  phone buttons are hard to use . 
i have tried other headsets and at last got a true num_extend
i highly recommend it !  i would give it six stars if i could !  !  . 
if anyone reading this has any suggestions to help me install ,  i d appreciate it . 
like someone else said pretty much just like the taco bell trays . 
please let me know if you have any comments or questions !  . 
i highly recommend them .  .  . and what a steal num_num for $
but that s just a concern and not a problem with the screen protector . 
 look at another iphone real closely till you see tiny tiny squares . 
all in all i love it it was a perfect buy  !  !  !  . 
i needed a marble slab for working with chocolate ,  so i thought this would be perfect . 
the weight of the box it arrived in was the first clue to its quality . 
he loves it and from what i see ,  it s very solid and heavy . 
the unit never turns off ,  which ,  while conserving battery life ,  is somewhat disconcerting at first . 
it may even be a better f fit than the original filter we had . 
tools are included but you will also need a heat gun or hair dryer . 
it was charged within a few hours and has been able to charge anything i throw at it . 
i don t really like the color either . my husband broke a bowl . 
it is not burning heat and will not burn you if you expose yourself to it  it s hot  . 
i think it works just fine and i plan to keep it . 
i was looking for something to keep my gps holder in place ,  this little mad made the job . 
the wrap enclosed is the same size used by the larger older model . 
it can be used for removing water fro any item not just salad . 
now with the kitchecaid cover ,  it not only is very attractive ,  it also is well protected . 
 unless your rich and can afford bose bluetooth headsets for $ +  . 
i use small dishes ,  plates ,  cups and bowls . 
wash it with hot water and a nylon type brush and dry it . 
i love the shiny red handle on mine . 
good price on set was my main goal at time of purchase . 
even when it s the little things in life . 
i was concerned that this might be a problem since i am replacing a one year old mr . 
it is so convenient to throw the other one and the dishwasher and still have this as a backup . 
probably ok if you had a droid num_extend
hers just stopped working a couple months back . 
it s still a good deal and a handy way to purchase . 
the case is very easy to install and remove ,  especially compared to the expensive competition . 
i bought this charger for my phone as a back up and to keep in my office . 
i think i am currently still using the second one . 
when i saw this phone i figured i could not lose . 
i bought to charge my droidx cell phone and they work great for that . 
i ve had this since november num_num and use it regularly . 
google sky worked so fast without lag ,  i could see how it s vastly different than num_extend num_extend
where it lacks in that grill flavor it makes up for it in keeping the food moist and perfect . 
this is an excellent quality and nicely designed vegetable brush . 
i highly recommend this knife to all my friends and anyone looking to get some nice knifes . 
again another addition to my daughter in laws collection . 
the motorola  phones stay on your head . ease of use for these  phones is superior . 
best of all ,  it s made in the usa . 
needed for my razr cellphone to change the internal battery . 
can t say that about many other things these days !  . 
works better than the old hoover i replaced at half the cost . 
however ,  in general ,  it was just what i expected and is serving its purpose well . 
i recommend this highly over the heavy and cumbersome rival dirt devil broom vac . 
oxo is recommended by america s test kitchen as well . 
the size of the cover is very good . 
i ve just ordered a replacement basket as mine is finally beginning to show signs of wear . 
we ve been subscribers to cook s illustrated magazine for maybe num_num years now . 
find a local roaster or roast your own . 
i ve also grilled steaks and hamburgers ,  baked bread ,  potatoes ,  and vegetables ,  all with perfection . 
let s face it :  french press coffee is vile . 
well worth buying ,  if you can burn the money . 
i am becoming a bigger fan of the joyce chen products everyday . joyce chen burnished bamboo utensil set . 
the plastic cover is a great safety feature for storage . 
i have a brita pitcher so the filters need to changed . 
the difference comes in the fact that making milkshakes with this blade vs . 
scissors are sturdy yet conveniently come apart for cleaning . 
the cost is low ,  the feature set just right and it just works . 
it does do a good job and it goes on the phone nicely . 
this bowl is terrific for gripping the counter top . 
take care of your board and it will last a lifetime . 
since other reviewers have mentioned the same thing ,  this is clearly a recurring problem . 
pays for itself after the first few uses . 
i think it is the most wonderful gift i had ever received for xmas . 
i can plug it anywhere and will fit on a power strip without clearance issue . 
i waited two years to write a review . 
love anything bundt and was happy to purchase this soft cover of the original bundt cookbook . 
right now i have five chef knives on this rack . 
i consider five years of every day use good for any appliance in this price range . 
the case is far more critical for me than either of those two things . 
i didn t try it on my carpet yet . 
microplane graters have been a wonderful kitchen accessory for some time . the professional level of grater is far superior . 
i ordered this guy after we got there from amazon as soon as we had an address set up . 
its been over num_num months and the case is still looks new . 
only things i ve used it on ,  but it has worked beautifully . 
one of the best grinders on the market . 
i absolutely love these non stick tortilla bowl makers . 
i ordered num_num of these for general purpose use in the kitchen and around the house . 
i expect many years of use from this product . 
i bought this to grind flax seeds and it does that very well . 
this is a perfect ,  inexpensive machine that facilitatesa simple and natural process . 
i have had the plain vanilla timer for ages and love it . 
the lid is lighter ,  however ,  so it evens out . 
i have not used it to poach eggs ,  so i don t know how that works . 
other than that ,  it s a great little cooker !  . 
i used vaseline around the lid and pot edge hoping that it would keep it from sticking . 
bought @ amazon . com and received it just one day . 
even a professional will admire your prize possession of this mixer . 
it does give spoken turn by turn directions ,  and i found the routes to be pretty reasonable . 
seems to work well ,  i ve had ,  ine two years . 
ok ,  it s not nuclear powered ,  but this can get a quart of water boiling in just a few minutes . 
it s more than a basic charging dock for your ipod touch num_extend
i have use the mirror ones for my num_extend iphone and it was thick . 
this has a nice even edge so it can get under the food with a clean quick wipe . 
the fork is a bit more expensive ,  but the quality of this fork makes up the difference . 
very durable and not madeof your typical cheap material that most other made in china cables are . 
great value if you re looking for a solution to the antenna problem . 
i am looking forward to trying to make pasta and sausages . 
i ve used this set over the past year ,  and it still looks like new . 
i should have bought this years ago when i started cooking . 
the result is a knife that is remarkably responsive and balanced . 
the cookies are also perfectly round and professional looking . 
they are the old kind  better than none  and not the new silicone gaskets . 
for the price ,  they are a great investment . 
this filter not only works for the dust and dirt . 
french press coffee is known for its full ,  rich flavor . 
i usually did it outside straight into the trash can . 
obviously years of use will add a patina of scratches to this tool ,  but here ,  the thing . 
i mean scrapers in general ,  but this one is decent . it will melt tho . 
this is a tremendous pitcher ,  not just a measuring cup . 
my preference is to have my phone on my belt ,  not in my pocket . 
the screen guards happily retain a soft ,  silky feel that is very nice . 
the sides of the pan are the perfect height . 
i sat down ,  watched television and let it take over a huge room . 
people say the grinder makes a huge difference . 
it is amazing how much longer the life of this new battery is . 
i ve heard from others that that feature could be causing the problem ,  but we will see . 
seems to be well made and of good quality . 
the bottom of the case was enclosed in soaked cardboard . 
this is the best smartphone i have ever used in my mobile life . 
i ll have to get num_num more of these for my bar later ! notes about the juicer : it s solidly built . 
the wired set was easy to connect but the wires were cumbersome and distracting . 
this is a really nice product and the price was exceptional . 
i bought this pitcher to replace the old plastic one i ve been using for years to make tea in . 
i purchased several of these pans for a wedding cake i was making . 
it s the thinnest cover i could find .   my solution is to not use the back cover . 
this pitcher is great for mixing frozen juice . 
i have already placed the order for a new one for my iphone num_extend
i ve had zagg for num_extend years on num_num iphones kindle fire ,  ipad and now samsung num_extend
this beats by far any hand mixer i have ever seen . 
these are serrated ,  so they keep their cutting edge sharp when used on hard dinner plates . 
i don t like to iron clothes ,  or even steam them . 
installation is quick and easy . the material of the outer case is nice and shows no fingerprints or smudges . 
i ve never been a fan of anything other than outdoor grilling . 
the stovetop popper gives popcorn with the very best texture and flavor in just a few minutes . 
it really hasn t been an issue for me . 
for the first time ever ,  num_num hours between a charge . 
this is not just a water filter ,  folks . 
i was wearing the lanyard with the playsport while floating in the  lazy river  ride at a water park . 
our can opener is now dying after about num_num years . 
no more struggling with separating coffee filters from one another . 
even though this cost less from amazon than elsewhere ,  it is a bit pricey . 
it s faster ,  has more features ,  better battery life and easier to use now . 
the nubs could be raised a little more to fit better into the divets to  lock  the phone together . 
so far it hasn t clouded . does it s job ,  is easy to clean and keeps the fat out of the gravy . 
not much to say about this but the name pyrex says it all . 
it is narrower ,  but slightly thicker and longer to balance out the internal capacity . 
i am actually using it as an alarm . 
i ve gone through quite a few chargers that always end up fraying or just stop working . 
usually when i cut brisket ,  it shreds rather than slices . 
but because it moves so much air ,  it works so well . 
so far i have been very happy with my zo . 
this knife is so good ,  it feels dangerous . 
amazon s reseller are charging whatever the market will bear . please understand i am not knocking amazon . 
the holder is super nice and holds the thirstystone coaster set perfectly . 
things like beets ,  sweet potatoes  expect to have to work some on these  ,  turnips ,  etc . 
this seems like it would have been such an easy fix . 
i love that they are dishwasher safe  i hand wash the lids  . 
if i stay away from oily beans there s no static problem . 
i never have wires all over the place anymore . 
i do have a great mixer ,  so why to bother with a processor too . 
the rubber ring around the base keeps it from moving on countertops or the corner of your num_extend
in the past ,  i ve ordered the seidio batteries but after upgrading phones a few times ,  they just add up . 
i haven t had any problem whatsoever with this charger and bought several for my family and friends . 
the commuter series doesn t protect like the defender series ,  however ,  it is easier to use and charge . 
if i have extra in the bowl i just replug it and it heats up again . 
i also have an iphone num_extend and an android ,  but i love the blackberry for my business . 
as other reviewers mention ,  it looks terrific ,  and you can t beat the price here on amz . 
i m very glad that i bought it ,  i ll recommend to everybody that wants to by a phone charger . 
when i do need one though ,  this one is great . 
well , thanks to this can opener ,  i no longer have sharp edges ,  just smooth ,  beautiful edges . 
the cool blue clock digits also match my microwave s clock . 
you can cut through food and turn heavier foods without it drooping because of the heat . 
i bought this to replace a much more expensive unit that finally broke . 
i got this for my wife to use at the gym . 
i deducted one star for the price of the set . 
i ve owned a lot of carpet cleaners over the years ,  and this is the best so far . 
i was initially hesitant to order this pitcher because of prior reviews mention lid and handle issues . 
and it s dishwasher safe ,  too ,  with one caveat . 
just as easy to pair ,  and similar voice quality . overall it is worth the price and feels well built . 
unlike other reviewers ,  mine actually measured above num_num degrees and they probably didn t let their syrup boil long enough . 
it s a bit annoying ,  but it s worth it . 
but i am so pleased that i did . 
i use mason jars for canning food and storing dry goods ,  so these lids are invaluable . 
i ve been making fresh bread and bagels every week and it s been no hassle . 
again ,  great protectors . side note .  .  . be extremely careful while putting this on . 
recently the little wire mic cover has come unglued as well . 
this is a real ,  quality ,  motorola accessory and i highly recommend it !  . 
also ,  it doesn t stick out ,  away from your face ,  like some bluetooths . 
for that purpose alone the num_extend is perfect . 
it is easy to install and remove the tools once you have done it once . 
it workson severalphones in my home . the side plug help wit more space in the outlet . 
i tried this as a way to steam them in the microwave . 
i store many things in canning jars now such as ,  coconut and all different kinds of nuts . 
it is much better than having to clean to mixer prior to using it each time . 
judging from what i said above ,  i bought the first one more than num_num years ago . 
check this out before you buy another one . 
i use them daily and enjoy the comfortable feel of their handles . 
henckels knives that i wanted to keep in top shape . 
i rubbed it ,  heated it ,  and threw it in the oven to keep it clean . 
the num_extend smart pen is one of the best i ve tried . 
a wonderful product ,  and my husband loves all the breads that i can make now . 
after extensive research on the more expensive grinders we decided to give this capresso grinder a try . 
i did not need it for the phone but i have more uses for it ,  thanks . 
i purchased prior to taking a num_num day weekend trip and was able to use extensively . 
got this as a gift for a foodie in my household . 
if they just made this about a half inch deeper and wider ,  it would be perfect . 
i like that it has too plugs for two usb cables . 
we use it when preparing meals for larger groups  e . g . 
this helps a lot for cleaning potatoes that i buy that happen to be pretty dirty . 
some of the parts cannot go in the dishwasher . 
cleanup is easy since you can toss it into the diswasher without fear of rust . 
faberware is always a good realistic priced product . 
once ,  after num_num hours ,  i went to pour the coffee out because i thought it was cold . 
i just wish they had more colors because i would ve bought them all . 
if you want to talk on a handset rather than your iphone ,  this product will do the trick . 
the realook is definitely flat at its edges . 
this case looks sharp and feels good and does what it says . 
so $ for this kit was very much worth it . 
i bought this phone for my num_num year old father in law . 
it ll irritate you no end in the beginning but you get used to it . 
leaving off the crock was a poor move . 
they really gleam ,  right out of the dishwasher . 
the breadman panini maker is a welcome addition to my kitchen . 
this is a great juicer iv been using it over a year and its great . 
i am not a great cook but this helps . 
these have made it really simple to bake . 
my girlfriend lost hers and needed a replacement . 
easily worth five times what i paid for it . 
when i got it i was pleased by how sparkly and deep purple the cover is . 
it definitely comes in handy if traveling for the weekend . 
perfect fit did not have to trim corners . 
grinder can be set to grind for num_num to num_num cups of coffee . 
large buttons ,  big numbers ,  loud buzzer that stops after about num_num seconds ,  has over timer and works perfectly . 
guests love using it ,  and it is a bit of a novelty . 
very simple easy to use digital thermometer for ensuring the food has reached the correct temperature . 
since cleaning is super easy i guess this is fine but i was a bit surprised . 
it might take a few tries to get the screen protector on straight without any bubbles showing . 
the machine is high enough to accommodate high rising loaves so i have been very pleased . 
i lives up to the expectations . gs ii looks super sexy in this case . 
the variable carafe hotplate control is nice as well ,  because i hate burnt coffee . 
given how many complaints have appeared concerning this unit ,  you would do well to check reviews of comparable models . 
it does not charge a nokia lumia num_extend
they have also held up extremely well  :   . 
i ve been using it for over a year and it is still working fine . 
my strawberries are putting out little shoots that want to grow roots . 
who puts a salad spinner in the dishwasher ?  just rinse the lettuce bits off and let it air dry . 
the sheets ,  mattress and pillows all dry quickly because of the low level heat . 
i have several digital probe thermometers ,  but each requires you to insert ,  read and withdraw . 
i ve never had any issues ,  but if it ever stops working ,  i will buy the same grinder again . 
i have looked on amazon for them and don t see them . 
 box contains num_num double packets; each double packet contains two num_num gram portions of starter . 
if your using it for potatoes then think again unless it s just for one . 
i love the phone and was concerned that if dropped i would be picking up pieces forever . 
i still feel the  clip plain  after wearing it for num_num min . 
a lot of these recipes require these attachments . 
i would suggest either have a fixed plug that doesn t fold ,  or have it lock into the  open  position . 
the tarts shells for the quiches turned out perfectly !  the weights cleaned very easily too . 
they fit the wide mouth jars and won t rust like the metal lids eventually do . 
i ve purchased countless numbers of mugs that are advertised as thermal and drip proof . 
that s a difference of $ which is about a % savings . 
i heard that you could use a drinking glass to cut the dough . well ,  that didn t work well for me . 
we puchased tthe adams cups because they resemled the old ones . 
in some reviews ,  people mentioned that the cheese cutter did not arrive aligned correctly . 
nice to have them off the counter and out of the way . 
makes an attractive serving after i have removed the twine from each wedge prior to serving the meal . 
took a while to figure out how to put them in . 
sinks are hard and a little bump can cause damage to expensive items . 
this case is not ugly but it leaves a lot to be desired in terms of looks . 
the small phillips head driver wore out before i got all the screws out . 
good product as a backup for other cables . 
you any beat the price along with free shipping . 
though they don t drain a car s battery ,  they do lessen the playing time of your ipod or player . 
had no problem paring it with a lg num_extend lg num_num and a htc design . 
this is fine by me as i do not move around with the phone when i am at work . 
i really like the fact that its a magnetic closure . 
easy to open ,  easy to close ,  no leakage . 
they are beautiful ,  durable and machine washable !  highly rec . 
then i inserted the sim and removed the film . 
i m back again buying another bluetooth after my cat ate yet another num_extend and counting  . 
i also ordered the  clamp  style peeler to ensure options for use . 
i received two of these griddles for christmas num_extend and absolutely love them . i use them on my gas range . 
it does not inter fear with reception or anything . 
the only thing i have discovered is that i have better results using thicker sliced bread . 
this is a very nice little crock pot . 
it s safe ,  easy to use ,  easy to wash ,  and makes chopping less of a chore . 
i was lucky that in early october ,  best buy chose to offer the fascinate for free . 
i like that it s retractable plus i also like that the retractable cord is extra thin . 
that being said i was using a wall charger that came with the phone . 
i love waffles and this contraption makes great waffles . 
great product ,  easy to install and very durable . 
it works fine and makes the expresso perfectly . 
the sturdy wood handle is great to manoeuvre the wok to get some brown color on the side . 
i have enjoyed using this product over the years . 
we have used it over num_num years and had no problems . 
num_num years ago ,  i had some little wussy thing that i gave to goodwill . 
the best part is the way it unlocks the aroma and flavor when you grind . 
my other set block out even more noise and have better sound quality . 
while my steak was resting ,  i quickly scrubbed my pan with some warm water and salt . 
was so glad to see that these clotheslines are still available !  . 
not a super big deal for me but i have had a few very frustrating moments with it . 
some other stylus s i ve used are too short and fat or too skinny to actually use . 
please check the review date on some of the less favorable reviews . 
each piece is solid and easy to lift and manage . 
a full charge came about num_num hours after being plugged in . the set also comes with micro usb ac adapter . 
i really needed it and it took about num_num weeks . 
but it s not an issue with the hard shell cover . 
my mom cooks probably every single day so this is quite an accomplishment for any sort of kitchen utensil . 
it took a long time to clean it up and season it again . 
this is a great grater ,  it is sharp ,  handles well and even looks good . 
it cooks evenly ,  never sticks and is easy to clean . 
never thought i needed this little tool until i got one . 
it is missing some protection at the top of the phone but no big deal . 
but ,  there is . this chef knife is great ,  and for the price ,  it s way better than some more expensive brands . 
i had to play around with the settings at first . 
i m just happy that they finally made a mirror screen protector for the iphone num_extend
very flexible ,  but strong neck allows positioning to suit your needs . 
i like the medium setting as it mimics the sound of the air conditioner . 
also i use them in kitchent to help organize different size dishes ,  plates to save cupboard space . 
it also blocks out background noise as well . 
that is a long time !  so of course my replacement was going to be a west bend . 
what did i ever do before these were invented ?  i use mine every day . 
so you see it in the first pitcher with a new filter . 
not so good for marathons if you sweat a lot . 
the sound on both ends of a phone call are very good too . the fit for me is almost perfect . 
the detachable water piece is nice ,  though i never detach it . 
the last brush i used was from the dollar store and didn t last very long . 
so easy and much faster to get the lids on the jars for their water bath or pressure cooker . 
i know it is a veneer ,  but you would never tell just by looking at it . 
i use a tupperware juice container with measurements on it and a pour spout . 
this organizer for my daughters small kitchen is very nice and very sturdy . 
if you need something of high quality that will protect your phone ,  this casemate will certainly do the job . 
these both work ,  but clearly the espresso grind will extend your brew time . 
it grips tightly to the windshield and hasn t fallen off once . 
but oh well ,  it s a good price for num_num cases . 
the handle also stays cool to the touch . 
as the title says .  .  .  . but i drive a lot for work and have num_num cell phones . 
the bottom of the pot stained pretty quickly . 
i generally like zyliss products and added this one to my kitchen . 
honestly ,  this thing is solid enough that you could knock someone out with it if you had to . 
this wheel is great because it is duel purpose and works very well . 
so glad to have found a soap pump that is practical and works . 
i am pleased with these screen protectors ,  the price is great and they do the job . 
they are easy to clean and make delicious fruit rolls !  not much else to say about them . 
i bought this to replace the original battery that came with my htc evo num_extend
the bread canister goes in my stainless steel interior dishwasher at sanitary setting . 
it small profile is prefect in tight areas . 
works great on parmesan ,  ginger ,  and garlic too . 
this case appears to be made of an acceptable grade of plastic that will give your cells good protection . 
it is convenient and results in nicely popped kernels . 
it fits nicely around my phone ,  the button popped off ,  but was easily fixed . 
as with any cover ,  they sometimes need cleaning ,  but have yet to scratch . 
i guess we all live life at num_num miles per hour these days . 
and you can play flash games too ,  if it s not hard enough . 
the suction cups are large and placed well for standard size shower tiles . 
i m not putting a ribeye in the microwave !  high end price on this one ,  though . 
anything i can get off my countertop makes me happy . 
oh i don t want to forget the ease of fulling the pot . 
they don t leach chemicals into my beverages ,  either . 
the case is difficult to use without ear peace . 
it does a very quick and easy job of slicing all hard cheeses . 
love anise bcos just like a good and plenty but better . 
for the price ,  this is a quality set of cutlery . 
my favorite part is that i can put it in the dishwasher !  . 
but it does make the phone feel more solid ,  and fits in my hand better . 
this otter box defender series case and holster was exactly what i needed . 
neither one has faded or degraded in any way . 
what else can i say !  works just like it should . 
very little so it doesn t take up a lot of room on a night stand . 
the reason for the num_num is because the screw on top will  pop  into two pieces . 
they work great ,  so i ordered num_num more !  . 
these are always consistent and very good quality . 
i was unaware of the problem so just was lucky on the particular machine i bought . 
i wanted to try rapid rise yeast ,  but it requires hotter than usual water . 
it says it fits all barbantia boards ,  so i figured what the heck ,  i ll just order a barbantia one . 
dough hook really adds to usefulness of mixer . 
holmes used to make a bathroom heater ,  and i loved it . 
it isn t as noisy as my hand mixer . 
easy to use ,  cuts pizza nicely ,  cleans easily , excellent quality .  .  . highly recommend . 
i would never put these knives in the dishwasher but apparently you can . 
this is a good product for drying out vegetables . 
i received my product today i was a bit concerned thinking it may not work . 
i used this to replace the shattered screen of my boss  boss  num_extend
i only just received mine but i know it is going to be used very often in my household . 
this eureka had great reviews ,  but i most liked it  clog resistant hose  . 
this dock charges it and puts it at a great angle for an alarm clock . 
just takes a little getting used to in reading how much power remains in the device . 
and ,  my family uses these scissors all of the time . 
serves the purpose but you have to be careful not to use a knife to cut the baked goods . 
turns out we are in a poor location for america s more modern  and supposedly superior  cdma system . 
even my num_num year old can attach and inflate the bed . 
the knife is sharp enough to go through the bread without any trouble . 
i have had them for almost a month now and have no problems with them at all . 
since buying and using there is a definite difference . 
i has been using a num_num year old low end model and there is no comparison . 
and it happens often enough with my num_num year old dad . check the price mentioned at the seabreeze website . 
as a result i called a particular person a few times and they couldn t hear me . 
it was to close to let the charger plug in all of the way . 
probably use this size scoop most often for my cookies . 
i wish all appliances were made with this same durability . 
the phone has all of those things you don t like from the big providers . 
i only do birthday cakes for kids at home and this is perfect . 
it is about as noisy as a hand vacuum . 
i suspect it will look even better the next time i clean it . 
just a little clamp and glue an it s solid . 
this was consistent over the last num_num days i ve had the phone . 
use them as the manufacturer advises; as an aid to handling utensils and food on a hot grill . 
i ve been looking for a magnetic knife holder for quite a while and finally settled on this one . 
it does that and everything else . even with sunglasses on in the texan sun i can read my phone !  . 
when they were cool i made my husband bite into one . 
i highly recommend this product !  it is really fast .  .  . it just took a little practice . 
there was no catching ,  or damaging the produce ,  and it took a lot less time . 
but at $ or so a pop ,  i was hoping they would be better designed and nest . 
i like the programming when it s turned on . 
i believe because of the thickness ,  it was hard to get all the bubbles out ,  but worth the effort . 
easy to setup ,  great battery life and they voice quality is really good for hands free use . 
the top plug for the headphone jack seems to be off by a millimeter or num_extend
it feels nimble in my hand ,  is easy to work with and keeps a sharp edge . 
for the price + quantity ,  this is a good buy . 
pairing additional devices can be done by pressing the device and holding for num_num seconds . 
its floppy and has treads like a tire . 
unlike other graters ,  when i tap this one ,  all the grated ginger falls right out . 
they work just like they say they will ,  there easy to install and are very well priced at amazon . 
and then dumping out the water and cleaning the big pot . 
an egg cooked in this machine taste so much better than boiled ,  i recommend it anyone . 
this case fit fine ,  had a good feel ,  but i expected more for something at this price . 
of chunky cinnamon applesauce and canned it for the winter . 
this is a great product and zests well . 
when my braun flavorselect coffee maker unexpectedly stopped working ,  i had to scramble to find a new machine . 
i had this phone years ago before i got a smartphone . 
this one protects the back ,  front ,  top ,  bottom ,  and sides . 
bad reception at your home or office ?  just add wifi . 
i love it !  it looks great in my kitchen . 
these are a little bit more decorative than just a normal set of chopsticks ,  . 
they are the best made glasses i have ever used and they are affordable . 
i finally settled on this kitchen aid thermometer . 
mine had become torn ,  so i found this on amazon and quickly purchased . 
as one of the other reviewers pointed out ,  the battery life is very good . 
she has this on her dry erase board which makes more room on her desk . 
these arrive quickly and are of better quality than the cheaper chargers . 
it s not there for show . cons :  i did not realize that there is no belt clip . 
i ve used it several times and it still looks brand new !  the popcorn never burns . 
but for the price it is certainly acceptible . 
this is a great utility pan in my kitchen ,  and a great price from amazon . 
i ve been looking for something like this for a long time . 
i read the tips from other viewers and that helped . 
the medium bowl i rarely use and could do without . 
having a bunch of them ,  means they all are the same height if you want to build a num_extend
it is just what every num_extend owner needs to protect their phone !  . 
slightly pricey but as the saying goes ,  you get what you pay for . 
bought it to soak nuts in before making milk . 
i haven t used them yet ,  but they appear to be as advertised . 
i follow the paula school of butter and pan fry my steaks with it . 
i wont bore you with all the scientific evidence . 
this charger is the same one i paid $ for at att . 
we try to be careful and push them in carefully yet determined . 
if you re slightly off ,  just squeegie it into place . 
i love this case !  i got it for half to retail price and it is pretty and durable . 
very reliable att service with this booster . same thing at home . 
they are not too cheap but they are not the best . 
it s cute !  got num_num of them ended up giving it to my mother . 
i knew i would be thrashing my battery during the day ,  so i opted to get a backup . 
this is my num_extend farberware coffeepot in num_num years . 
i bought one for me and one for my wife and we both love them . 
nice product and i will continue to use only blackberry products for my blackberry phone . 
a little cumbersome as it does need to sit away from the walls but worth it for less allergies . 
the picture shows black and i wanted black . 
i also like the fact that it is small but still does the job . 
that s my opinion .  .  . you make your own decision . five stars and my recommendation . 
both are available for free download on the nokia site .  another option is to get a usb sim card reader . 
i use it everyday as it hold my oatmeal . 
all the parts you need to clean are right there and easy to get to . 
seems to be of good quality and really protects the phone at a great price . 
maybe you don t need it ,  and that s fine . 
i couldn t even make it through half a day anymore . 
the less work i have to do in the kitchen ,  the better !  . 
plus ,  i can put a few pottery items on top of it . 
it fits my samsung galaxy num_extend and my daughters htc evo and htc evo shift . 
i expect to get a lot of service from this one as well . 
this was my first time and i made mini brownies . 
we have used this for some time and it is terrific . 
first ,  the color !  while the kitchen aid orange is paler than the francisfrancis !  espresso machine ,  it s a nice orange . 
i haven t had any problems with the lid like other postings described . 
for this to fit in the window ,  i would need to get the additional spacer available for the fan . 
i wear it almost > num_num hrs every day between music and calls . 
i like having it as an option for wireless sound . 
but in lattes ,  there s only a small bit of froth and it s not nearly as important . 
if you have read all the way to my review ,  just stop here and buy this breadmaker . 
that s why i give it four rather than five stars . 
as all oxo good grips ,  it has a tactile feel and great fit in the hand . 
i am now getting num_extend num_extend dbm hspa+  reception with no variation in signal . 
those things might not warrant the deduction of a full star ,  but amazon doesn t do half stars . 
i had to make my own cut outs to make it work . 
that one is just perfect for me !  unfortunately ,  i had to return this item . 
they are wonderful for use in my daughter s room ,  but i wouldn t display them in the living room . 
it performs basic phone functions flawlessly and handles moderately complex multimedia without a hiccup . 
it still works and i ll continue to use it ,  just wish it didn t look rusty on the edges . 
plus ,  using the scoops keeps my hands clean ,  just kidding . 
i actually returned the first one i got because there was a dent in the bottom . 
i like it ,  but really i want exactly look picture in amazon website . 
my cakes brown nicely ,  but not too much . 
works great !  have used it daily for about a month . 
to my relief ,  the sound was due to the separately packaged box of lids and shaker tops . 
much less expensive that replacing the entire toilet brush and holder !  . 
it is well made and i expect it to last a long time . 
some comments i ve read said that the steam containers easily break and you can t order replacement parts . 
the added bonus features of the flashlight and laser pointer may come in handy . 
a little oil and it s ready to go . what a cool piece !  . 
prologue :  i am referring to the klipsch quintet iii speakers manufactured from num_num to num_extend
i just had my first lunch omelet with crumbled bacon and cheese and it was perfect . 
i cut up an old mini usb cable for the wires and secured everything with electrical tape . 
makes it easy to use your phone for entertainment or plug into an external speaker . 
i love this device and was sad when motorola discontinued it . 
thank you so much for the low price on this movie . 
made of a softer plastic and resistant to scratches . 
i add melted butter and lite salt after popping . 
the phone is very well protected and gets minimal bulk from the case . 
i work at home and my office has porcelain tile . 
now run it around the underside of the lid with downward pressure . 
works great ,  cleans very easily and makes great popcorn . 
now i m thinking about the teaspoon size too . 
used it for a few days and haven t had any problems . 
this coffee maker brews coffee and it is in my mug in num_num minutes . 
all of my other batches have been good . 
they are so handy all of the time !  . 
i didn t even know about the silicone part ,  who cares . just can t rave enough over these . 
only downfall is i keep forgetting the handles can get hot and grab them . 
it doesn t have any temperature degree settings just a few numbers ,  a star  asterisk  ,  and a fan icon . 
this one is very similar and i expect it will be just as durable . 
plus ,  with the brushed stainless interior ,  i can use metal utensils without worrying about damaging the finish . 
solid mounting ,  and the  jaws  clamp down nicely on the phone holding it solidly . 
all i to do was research more the best price . 
fits nicely on my num_extend num_extend and num_extend pots . 
and the size ?  well it too ,  is perfect ,  just right to fit in almost any drawer or cabinet . 
if you can t keep it together then you will be cleaning the inside of the microwave . 
the sound mode button allows you to set an equalizer setting to adjust for voice ,  instrument ,  or music . 
was looking for light weight racks that would store easily and these fit the bill beautifully . 
so fall small short or waht ever th pc term is this year ,  should be good fit wise . 
love these ,  they give a high fashion look to my bathroom with an expensive shower curtain . 
i mean ,  don t stand on it ,  but they are more substantial than a lot of the wire organizer stuff . 
i dropped my previous kettle which bent the spout . 
besides myself being a cuisinart snob ,  i will say that i wouldn t use any other product in my kitchen . 
the suction cup is on there pretty solidly . 
once i figured it out ,  it was great . 
the phone has a couple of draw backs . 
the pop maker is great and fits in the freezer . 
i ve ordered a total of num_num of these cases . 
this is my second krusell case and it is very different leather than the first one . 
this makes rolling dough ,  whether it s elastic or crumbly ,  a breeze . 
however ,  it will acquire its own share of scratches . 
that s why i decided to get this trent icarrier . 
i doubted the durability when i got it because i felt it seemed flimsy . 
we have a bar type and quality old fashion single toggle osterizer mixer for num_num years . 
instead ,  i searched for the best ground coffee and was satisfied with the results of my investigation . 
just be warned if your clumsy your going to want better protection for your phone . 
if you are planning to wash this in a sink the version with handles might be safer . 
have it on an iphone num_num and it fits well . 
clean screen and very clean environment means a very clean install . 
it does not protect much but it allow you to keep a thin device . 
as far as roasting veggies in the pan you won t get a better flavor to the vegetables . 
i also like the ability to charge two devices at the same time . 
i had another pan ,  but i could only use it in my huge oven because it was too big . 
having it s own filter and basket is nice and the filter hasn t stained . 
you pretty much give all the commands by your voice . 
easy to clean and dishwasher safe too ?  wow !  look no further !  !  !  . 
great little zester ,  as i expected from oxo . 
all in all this spice carousel is attractive ,  useful ,  and optional . 
not only the best rice cooker ever ,  the best mw i have ever had . 
it was not thin enough for my iphone element case ,  but then ,  almost nothing is . 
i m hoping it just needs to be broken in . 
we held off on buying a salad spinner for years ,  but are glad we finally got one . 
the stainless steel look is very sleek and great looking for parties . 
the cup rating for these is european cups ,  like a shot of espresso num_extend oz  not american cups num_extend
i ve been using it for a few weeks now and there are no signs of wear or zipper issues . 
the pointer looks to be just next to the fourth mark . 
i really get use out of this cutter . 
i don t know ,  but from now on ,  i won t . 
i was scared it would add bulk ,  but its perfectly slim and hugs the phone . 
i put a lot of heavy coats on it ,  and it still works well . 
this is a very heavy board so be prepared if you purchase it . 
i messed up and forgot and the pan was really discolored from overheating . 
the stockpots are wonderful ,  they are the used most of the times . 
very attractive on the table or just on the counter with fruit . 
but really my bacon consumption has increased num_num fold . 
also recharges her ipod  shuffle  ,  and her kindle too . 
as to noise ,  it is actually quieter then my wind tunnel . 
the protector still seems to be stuck on well and is not coming up at the edges . 
it is very modern ,  attractive and whisks ,  but not better than any regular whisk . 
yeah ,  a num_num year warranty that they seem to not honor ! well ,  back to the wmf . 
yet ,  it has never failed to produce a pot of favorable coffee ,  especially when using freshly ground coffee . 
this is the best sifter i have ever owned ,  i am extremely happy with it . 
if you can live with that caveat ,  the zyliss does a better job for less . 
quick and easy way to keep your phoen charged but untethered if always on the go . 
and so easy . if you re a baker ,  i d say go for the mini muffin tin . 
this was a needed accessory for my htc evo . 
it does cover up the ridge bumps though . 
it s not bulky ,  it s pretty solid and blends in my car . 
i buy them in lots of num_num given how prone i am to losing earbuds . 
not only is it cute looking but it makes a mean foam on top too . 
this product met all of those requirements and it cleaned the carpets very well . 
in some ways ,  this phone lacks the pizazz that surrounded the htc evo num_extend
worked out great ,  got a much better charge for a lot longer than the original battery . 
it s a basic white silicone case for the iphone num_extend
i think it is a great grinder for the money . 
since droid x is a larger and wider smartphone ,  smaller smartphones will have no problem . 
the quality appears outstanding ,  and it makes a great cup of coffee . 
i went to target ,  and they had similar chargers for $
they look about num_num times better than having a plastic bottle of dawn sitting on the sink . 
these really take the chlorine and other chemical tastes out of our city water . 
i really enjoy cooking and nothing makes it more relaxing than a beautifully well balanced quality knife . 
nice to have a case to keep them in . 
did i mention that people comment on how handsome it looks ,  too ?  . 
it does slide on pretty snug ,  so its not loose or easily moving . 
with this adapter ,  i could hear music coming out of both sides of my ear buds . 
customer service at breville is good but not great . 
i also plan on using it for sangria . 
paring knife logo is smaller and placed differently on the blade . 
what more can you say ,  its an otterbox case . 
it s so bad ,  i ve decided to buy samsung galaxy num_extend
we have even used it in the oven  baking  and had great results . 
it came a lot quicker than i had expected . 
i can only assume it provides some protection . 
nice set and has everything you need to do your basic canning . 
i worked off my faulkner reviewing the filters for these units . 
it s welded in and although you can clean it through the  gills  on the lid ,  you cannot replace it . 
i uploaded some customer images ,  since this is difficult to put into words . overall ,  this is what i wanted . 
my fiancee took it with her on a num_num day trip to germany . 
after all not everything comes from mcdonald s ,  kfc or the pizza delivery man . 
i want to kiss the person that made this product . 
we have a gas cook top and it performs better than any other . 
i am able to reach my phone with this unlike the other adapter on the window . 
a definite plus in the kitchen to have !  . 
i keep it on my counter and use it to grind spices ,  herbs ,  etc . 
mine will stay up indefinitely using this method . 
the crab scissors are wonderful and having these cute butter warmers to keep the butter melted was great . 
if you re a person that likes to be outdoors a lot ,  this is a great case for your phone . 
it works very well and really easy to install and remove . 
we rent out our beach house and a guest dropped it on the tile floor breaking the hinge . 
it all comes apart again easily when it s time to clean . 
touch controls work very well for volume control and making a call . 
obviously if you don t have dogs with long fur this may not be a real issue . 
search amazon and you ll see the cable too . 
it is very nice to look at as well as being really light weight . 
it s a different story . i had to have a backup charger and this was  it  . 
probably could have found something similar somewhere else for cheaper though . 
the num_num series has plenty of power to spare . 
of course ,  stoves vary but hopefully that gives you an indication of how low i have it . 
i came across this hook rack on amazon and thought i would give it a try . 
dishwasher safe ,  nice durable plastic ,  even has a grippy lip to hold onto while you re pouring . 
another couple of millimeters would have really helped . 
this is great for my allergies !  especially in winter when everything is closed up and the furnace is on . 
run water through the unit until no more fibers ,  dirt ,  etc . 
i will update this if needed as time goes on ,  as i have more experience using this item . 
really good quality and was easy to install . 
the protection screen takes away some of the touch screen sensitivity . 
you can t beat the ease and security with which these are installed . 
i love this drainer ,  it fits perfectly and holds dishes ,  pots ,  whatever and it looks good too . 
my only real reason for liking that one so much was its awesome volume level . 
easy to clean .  .  . my only gripe is that it s bulkier than my old one . 
so far ,  this gadget is working well for me . 
for example ,  this one has an odd lid with a valve contraption . 
the  open bottle here  logo on this one is cute . 
to be honest i ve just received this spiral slicer and have used it once . 
easy to use ,  serves a good purpose ,  sturdy built ,  works fine . 
solid grinder . have one from about num_num years ago . 
the cover adds protection and not a lot of weight . 
moreover ,  it s easy to clean and efficient and easy to use . 
for some reason i can t get the timer to work properly . 
this is absolutely necessary and keeps you from getting burned when working with hot jars . 
found this paring knife on america s test kitchen reviews as their favorite . 
i feel i really need to be in the same room so i ll hear it . 
would highly recommend this to anyone looking to cook pasta !  . 
however it s easy setup and ease of use is to notch . 
then i guess it is an everyday case . 
good quality cookware for the money and dishwasher safe . 
i already bought num_num of these for my htc evo . 
sigh guess i shouldn t worry about it now that you can get insurance on the phone !  . 
it was time for a new paring knife . 
be buying a couple small bowls as well . 
i had a white iphone so the scratches were less on the back . 
a couple of days ago i ran a conference call from my cell phone ,  from the car . 
it looks very expensive and it was actually very cheap . 
the cardock screen has six windows for apps . 
then you have to cool this mixture in a bowlwith icewater bath . 
and because martini doesn t taste like a martini if it is not served in a martini glass . 
i have num_num of these and just purchased another one . 
in the woods all day ,  fishing ,  out in the field working . 
fits the towels snug ,  so you don t take to many towels when you pull them . 
i create art with polymer clay ,  and this garlic press is perfect for making hair ,  flower centers ,  thistles ,  etc . 
it came so fast !  i got this item the next day ,  and uses stander shipping . 
and it s attractive enough to serve from at the table . a good componant of a basic set of cookware . 
haven t tried any of the attachments ,  that will be soon . 
the noise canceling mics num_extend in each  are positively amazing . 
the black got scratched just below the cover easily and looked bad . 
during the hot humid weather that we have been having the latter is very important . 
i use them almost everyday and they are still going strong . 
these are a good match for audioengine num_extend speakers . 
hot air is all upsides and no downsides  unless the noise bothers you  . 
this book has been real helpful to my daughter . 
my other pan is num_extend and i found that for certain recipes ,  i needed something larger . 
i have used it for several months and have found it to work flawlessly . 
it is very easy to use and clean . 
it is a soft silicone slip on case  not tpu  . 
replacing all the cheap containers i ve had in the past . 
but i do wish that parts made of polycarbonate were better packed . 
i use it everyday and i also use it for developing android apps . 
this blender can wake up sleeping kids on the other side of the house very easily . 
this bowl has been with me through pastries ,  salads ,  guacamole ,  and mashed potatoes ,  and everything between . 
no similar problem with my husband s iphone num_extend
the one you have to add the powder ,  milk ,  salt ,  vanilla extract and sugar . 
i bought it for him early last year in june and it s still going strong . 
this keeps my battery from losing power plus charges it along the way . 
when it arrived ,  i opened it up ,  got the manual and sat down and read it . 
does my pepper corns and my coffee beans just right . 
try to be creative you don t need to follow the traditional standard . 
i see no flaws on how effective this device is . 
you need the additional tray on top however  kitchenaid ft food tray attachment for stand mixers   . 
 : dthis little bundt pan delivers !  it pops out beautiful cakes in amazing detail . 
this battery fit perfect ,  charged quickly and has tripled my phones up time . 
i think i paid num_num dollars for it . 
i bought this for my niece she loves hello kitty . 
they last a long time even though i am not very gentle with my phone . 
the num_extend lbs weight makes flattening chicken breasts very quick . 
i took it off and applied a second protector . 
they work great and i purchased num_num pairs . 
after which ,  the headset will tell you how strong of a charge the headset has . 
but not after spending twenty minutes cleaning pot and area and starting over . 
the charge light got green and thecable was a success . 
this is a huge pain when you are behind the wheel and driving somewhere you are unfamiliar with . 
bought this num_num months back for my htc inspire num_extend
this may be the last set of dry measuring cups i will buy . 
this item is exactly what i needed for me krups num_extend all in one machine . 
much safer and gives you more surface area to carry items with as well . 
nice quality and will last a lifetime if you take care of it . 
this is my first capresso product ,  and i am really impressed . 
my only complaint about its functionality is that it s pretty rattly . 
alternatively ,  a new canister will be $ including shipping from them . forget it . 
this product is a very good screen protector and it fits properly . 
you may never need to sharpen them but you will never have a truly sharp edge . 
i know ,  that soybean oil isn t the healthiest stuff in the world . 
the cat knocked my cuisineart coffee pot off the counter and broke it . 
nice that it comes with a car power adapter . 
it s tomato season and they need to be sharp for that !  . 
sides are high for big fingers but very protective . 
didn t have anything to lose so i bought it ,  and it has really surprised me . 
there s also another led that indicates that the unit is on at the bottom . 
great ,  it is light but my phone is fully protected . 
i bought this for my mother and she loves it . 
i touch the button when i get in my car and it works right every time . 
wonderful value . consthe water fill slot is a little small and takes a steady hand . 
at first ,  i thought that i was imagining it ,  and that all chargers work at the same pace . 
i wanted something lighter that food would not stick to ,  but not teflon coating . 
haven t made crepes in it ,  but plan to . 
have had this about a month replacing a num_extend old num_extend
also lay out a few paper towels on the counter top underneath it while in use as well . 
it is my most prized piece of cookware . 
i love to make casseroles in this and that is why i originally purchased it . 
the moment you uncork a wine ,  the wine begins to change because of its contact with air . 
its really nice and good as far as doing what i expect which is to filter the water . 
it did the job !  now my phone look cool !  would recommend it . 
that means i save money on a second and possibly third grinder . 
your oiled side should be pointing down so excess can drip off and not spoil your finish . 
lastly ,  the price is right ! i will never buy  regular  shower curtian rings again !  . 
even holds my large bags of dog food closed . 
that and after some time the case becomes loose . 
the nordic ware lifter is heavy ,  but not uncomforatbly so . 
at this price ,  why not ?  keep one at each desk ,  or car ,  etc . 
since the popper is reasonably priced ,  i m going to buy another popper and try it again . 
the charge is as fast as i have seen and the price is cheap so i ordered a replacement . 
i like these bags because i can see what s in them . 
so yummy !  !  be sure and oil it up really well after use . 
i canceled the amazon order when i thought they had the wrong color . 
sometimes ,  cheese does get stuck up inside ,  but we just use a kitchen brush to solve that problem . 
it also keeps the roll in check  vs . 
the cover stays put with just enough snuggness . 
if you know anything about the otterbox cases ,  is that they are generally ugly . 
ok first you need a pan that is flat or it will not work and do not over fill . 
it is perfectly accurate every time i use it . 
however ,  since this baby came into our lives ,  we ve been slicing up cheese like there s no tomorrow . 
i went through an num_num ounce bottle of walnut oil just prepping it for its first use . 
my battery life is now far better than when i first reviewed . 
this mount leaves everything close enough and never falls out . 
highly recommended for any one who is on the go and needs a portable system to take with them . 
very nice people to deal with and extremely knowledgeable about products . 
probably one of the most useful pans ,  you ll find many other uses for it . 
they are reliable and consistent with a rapid response time . 
most people type with their thumbs while holding the phone so for them it wouldn t be an issue . 
purchased this charger to replace the orgianal charger for my htc evo num_extend
comfortable to wear ,  works with all my phones . 
it s still fantastic for making egg sandwiches because of the yolk getting a little done . 
the fit and finish is perfect and the price is the best part . 
holds paper towel roll tight ,  doesn t fall off the holder . 
i would recommend this product however and the price is certainly right . 
the recipe is easy to use and tastes better than any english muffin that i ve eaten . 
this is an excellent scraper at a great price . 
we recieved the item fast and it is a good quality product . 
use plenty of glue and wipe off excess ! should hold up much better that way ;} . 
i didn t mark it down cause i knew the shape when i bought it . 
will definitely get one more once mine begins to show wear and tear . 
freezer is more organized . made of a very durable material . 
these are exactly the same as the set we d had for years so they matched our existing set perfectly . 
i ordered one initially for myself ,  but i sold it to my coworker . 
any dry apply screen protector is really hard to get on without lint getting under it . 
we use it for large areas in our southern california  very dry a lot of the time  home . 
all the parts have a place and make them easy to locate . 
the motorola num_extend is a very good unit . 
there wasn t anything i couldn t pick up with it ,  including dog kibble and parrot pellets . 
usually ,  there s enough friction to prevent it from just sliding out . 
they sent me a replacement set to try since i didn t like my first one and this one performs . 
i have a few of these cables in various bags . 
but i was concerned that if i bought a stand ,  i would be too lazy to use it . 
great product bugeyedigital ,  i ll be ordering more soon . 
anyway ,  it s still a five star gadget in my opinion !  . 
i have now had this pepper mill for num_num years and it has never failed me once . 
it is solid and holds firmly to the wall with the provided screws . 
usually distracts me from mulling too long over such possible imperfections  if that is what they are  . 
the only negative is that it cannot be lifted by the lid once the pudding mixture is in it . 
well ,  the years have taken their toll on the plastic cup . 
love the grill marks and the fact that s food doesn t stick . 
in any case ,  i would not hesitate to buy another if needed . 
well ,  not on my pot !  !  !  i couldn t find them inside; i couldn t find them outside . 
i use them every week and run them through my dishwasher . 
the igo chargers and tips are really great . 
this zester gives nice ,  thin slices of orange peel . 
the smallest board may be hard to find a use for . 
i use this all the time !  only improvement would be to reverse the locking mechanism . 
it s very simple ,  very inexpensive ,  and goes perfectly with the num_num inch fibrox . 
now ,  it does come with a second battery which is helpfull but they do not last all that long . 
it makes fantastic popcorn and i don t have to use any oil at all . 
well help making sausage but not great for catching juices . 
so many wonderful recipes included and available online . 
the first time we used it we got a couple tablespoons of cotton candy . 
fit well and continued to keep it print on the products . 
i like this version of a meat pounder . 
i have owned it now for about two months and the loaves i have made have been perfect .  . foolproof really . 
you will get a super thinner cuts with this knife . 
the magnet is a good feature as i keep it on the fridge . 
the power is great when using the attachments . cons . 
it s cradle arms don t just spring out when you press the release buttons ,  they  glide  out slowly . 
but ,  considering i didn t even know it was included when i bought the oven ,  it s a freebie . 
lesson learned i will be using the case permanently . 
with this mini charger i only need the wire or maybe borrow one from somebody . 
i m not a coffee drinker so i don t know how well it grinds coffee beans . 
glass is durable and i love that i don t have to worry about plastic impregnating my food . 
the boom for the microphone comes out from one of the earpieces . 
i thought he would have to go over the carpet twice before it came clean . 
this makes the perfect size coffee for me . 
i gave this waffle maker as a shower gift . 
this griddle has a permanent home on my stove and i adore it . 
i have tried both to the bottom of the num_num cup icon ,  and to the top . 
i have been using the bb curve for the last year ,  and this is a huge step up . 
if not removed the bag will later break at higher temperatures . 
these are holding up very well despite repeated dishwasher beatings . 
app development has made a leap since i originally purchased the phone on launch date . 
i thought this item was a cool concept but never bought one . 
i ve had my popper for over a year and it s so easy and fast . 
my daughter bought me the smallest  one serving  version for my birthday . 
made sturdy and it fits my iphone num_num perfectly . 
i recommend this knife set to anyone who is looking for a quality knife set for bar or kitchen . 
love this mixer ,  it is an icon in food appliances . 
i have a dslr for photos . the phone is great; very responsive . 
maybe after  x  minutes ,  turn off by itself . 
giving for a gift so it will cushion any  drops  . 
comfortable to grasp and nice enough to leave out on the counter for instant access . 
however i paid $ for this same screen protector in the store great price . 
it will fill the void since there s less on the market ,  and there s nothing bad about this case . 
the more you work the frother the creamer it gets . 
that s why i was very pleasantly surprised at how quiet the unit is . 
durability ,  this item feels like a bullet proof . 
the extra length is very helpful as i sit on my couch or lay on my bed . 
we are very pleased with this saucepan and highly recommend it to all ,  who love to cook . 
i finally gave up trying to store my open bags of sugar in big zip close bags . 
my only hesitation was that several reviews said that some were broken upon receipt . 
she uses her champion a lot and i ve noticed very annoying sounds while she juices her veges . 
i have bought this and use it with my samsung galaxy num_extend skyrocket . 
it recognized it immediately ,  but it didn t launch anything . 
however ,  it seems to be much more expensive now ,  especially with the shipping cost . 
now im looking to buy the mhl adapter . 
it does not come with very many hooks ,  so you may want to buy more . 
it s easy to clean and fits well in a refrigerator shelf . 
they are unique in that they can actually survive being dropped without breaking . 
the bottom and sides feel like rubber ,  which means it s grippy compared to plastic . 
good quality bumper ,  i purchased for a friend . 
several different cleaning attachments come with it and they too are all very well made . 
this machine is easy to use ,  and heats right up . 
i had read some of the reviews on this electric skillet . 
which leads me to the other reason i bought the set . 
other than that ,  i can t really recommend a num_extend bb device anymore . 
the color is pretty close to photo and it fits well . 
also ,  if you want to store in fridge for a few days it is perfect . 
i dump hashbrown  puck  directly out of the ricer and cook it right up . 
the first time i used it ,  i was surprised at how much dirt it picked up . 
they store completely flat in a drawer rather than stacks of cutting boards taking up space . 
i like how its soft on the inside . 
these stands a very basic in design but they work well and they look pretty nice too . 
the manual contains no instructions about unpacking the machine . 
these buds are very comfortable and fit deep in the ear . they muffle out back ground noise very well . 
and i always cook boxed casseroles lower than the directions say because of over flow . 
this one is perfect and makes great coffee . 
only negative is that the noise is a bit loud . 
overall a good value ,  and handy for small jobs ,  . 
if you leave any coffee in the machine you will wake to a mess all over the counter . 
it holds enough tea for a very large cup . 
still freezes up every once in awhile but really good phone . 
this case fit my motorola num_num global like a glove . 
there is nothing like percolated coffee ,  it is absolutely the best and presto has fabulous customer service . 
primarily this iphone case is to stop your phone getting scratches . 
this stainless steel sugar bowl is a high quality dish with lid and spoon that has a slot . 
i found this bottle and that was it !  the opening is big enough for easy cleaning and refilling . 
i purchased these gaskets to fit my vintage triomphe jars . 
grime ,  grease and dirt will effect the long term suction power of the unit . 
i bought a second set because i was using the first set so much they were always dirty !  . 
i even use it to make scrambled eggs for two . 
i figured i d try an fm modulator since they re relatively cheap and easy to use . 
this thing is great !  does eggs just the right size for english muffins for breakfast sandwiches . 
it s a large size ,  but perfect for most of my mixing needs . 
i believe the designers at belkin had me in mind when they created this product . 
it s a monster and it s not even their biggest pan . 
it is a shame amazon has discontinued this item . 
no hanging ,  moving parts to break ,  and it s extremely quick and easy and secure . 
seems a bit pathetic but that modest delay can crush the spirit ,  a veritable purgatory . 
these are great !  they are pretty durable and i havent had any problems with them . 
i love to cook ,  i entertain frequently ,  and i collect cookbooks . 
it s great when you have to pick up a call . 
bought new dehydrators capable of drying num_num racks at a time so i bought this pair to expand production . 
it s solid ,  well made ,  and doesn t bend or rust . 
i got this one and it is the best . 
on high ,  it is almost as loud as a vacuum cleaner . 
very easy to use and very easy to clean . 
with two lighter style ports and two usb ports you can t go wrong with this charger . 
if i test this one that way ,  i ll let you know how it fares . 
just be careful not to bend the usb connector . 
its charge lasts a few hours and does not require the cell to play more . 
the speakerphone could be louder ,  but i rarely use that feature . 
not as aesthetically pleasing as the more dainty cables . 
i use my kitchen a lot and it just gets cluttered . 
the sides are thin . i would like to have a stockpot that s a little heavier and has thicker sides . 
i bought this scoop because i could not make uniform cookies ,  now i can . 
i have had the racks full of cookies  ,  and stacked num_num high . 
the last you will probably ever need to buy . 
quality matches the price but they look nice . 
i have several other everyday pans and each has taken a back seat to this one . 
i wanted something to enable me to easily charge all three in my car . 
i get all of my phone accessories on line . 
it s too short for my window ,  but still rest just fine in the frame . 
buy this one it is excellent and i love it . 
low profile ,  perfect fit ,  solid construction ,  feels great in the hand . 
kitchenaid gave me a discounted price on the new one ,  which after shipping came to $ less than amazon . 
i freeze the juice for all year s use . 
i used this for my razr maxx hd and it worked as advertised . 
beautiful french press ,  the seal is very secure and solid and i never get any grounds in my coffee . 
i did not experience the leaking problems experienced by numerous other people . 
sometimes i come back to the room and the roomba didn t find the base . 
the corn will be hot ,  and perfectly cooked . 
it would be really useful if these headphones were collapsible . 
i never want to be without these knives . 
set is a nice weight and looks great for the price . 
i ve owned percolators ,  dripolators ,  electric drippers ,  really everything but one of those vacuum units . 
tmo does not play with large pics for some reason . 
simply the best screen protectors for the price . 
i like this cell phone its great but i ant to get myas i have not used it yet . 
i accidently broke my daughter s pyrex measuring cup ,  so needed a replacement . 
it also periodically shoots little bits of it out the top and toward whatever happens to be in front . 
it s a breeze to operate and easy to clean . 
i don t know if that helps justify a purchase but it seems unusual for a cell to have . included num_extend
we have had this attachment for about three months now and have used it many times . 
and no ,  i dont have to scream to it ,  for people to hear me . 
i was very happy to see that the set came just as described with no damages . 
this num_num piece set of measuring cups comes in handy in the kitchen . 
really a good quality pan that cleans up easily after a moments soak in hot sudsy water . 
we liked ours so much that we purchased one for my grandmother for christmas ,  and she loves it . 
i am happy with the purchase and i would definitely recommend it for quality and attractiveness and washability . 
the plantronics savor num_extend bluetooth headset is an excellent little device to take with you on any drive . 
this heater is very quiet and definitely a little workhorse . 
it s great to add extra battery life to your iphone without adding significant bulk . 
that takes up a lot of time and even more battery . 
i totally recommend this as a phone and gaming headset  for voice of course  . 
i love pink appliances and they are very hard to find . 
i ve used it for long runs ,  num_num mi ,  etc . 
excellent products ,  i don t hesitate to recommend this . 
i would buy these again in a heartbeat . 
all in all ,  a very good saucepan for me . 
i am fairly small and i was easily able to put it together even though it towers over me . 
the only problem i had was the ones i ordered were missing the carry case . 
it s a delightful little machine ,  designed to please just one person at a time . 
cast iron can be your best friend if you treat it properly . 
i am not a coffee drinker ,  i just clean the pot . 
coffee coffeemaker since the yankee clipper was their exclusive pitchman . 
the added ability to answer calls makes them that much more useful . 
if you use the phone frequently or take frequent calls ,  expect to have to charge it daily . 
to let everyone know if it holds up . if it continue to keep cards or separates . 
the bowl has markings for all kinds of rice so you never have to guess on the measures . 
i don t have a cord laying around that i have to try to tuck in my dash . 
i thought about buying smaller wmf pizza cutter in order to save $
i finally graduated from the small hand held ones to this beauty . 
it is this huge cooker ,  not for your everyday meal . 
imagine kneading bread dough to perfection ,  in as little as num_num seconds !  its how i make french bread . 
the key to cooking with these is using low heat because the metal is a heat conductor . 
maybe the droid razr is better choice but it wasn t out when i got this . 
the sipping lid has a deeply recessed bottom where you have a hole for liquid to come out . 
excellent rating from reviewers here :  num_extend stars !  my rating is five stars ,  and i am no troll . 
if you handle it too much it will break ,  it you clean it ,  it will break . 
they came out easily and looked so cute and fun to decorate . 
this is the best value of a pepper grinder on the market . 
sleep like glass ,  very protective ,  fit perfect on my iphone num_extend
i ll try other pies ,  like apple and see it i have better results . 
john boos oil is the best oil for any butcher block . 
i ve used so called iphone adapters before that haven t worked at all . 
this seems to help make pink and white fish even more detectibly moist and tasty . 
these towels are absolutely fantabulous for the price . 
it is heavy and bakes evenly ,  the most important quality in any bakeware . 
we have put our heaviest bins on the bottom ,  and i would suggest others do the num_extend
after washing them often times the color still looks the same . 
i need a case to protect the smartphone while i m active yet enjoy my music . 
i m looking to purchase another one just in case . 
now all i need is a lid but i don t think i need it for what i do . 
all i can say is yes !  i love this machine . 
the oxo salad spinner is the best one we have used in our household . 
i would never even consider putting one of my pots or pans in a dishwasher . 
any precipitation or dust stays off the num_extend and keeps it working well . 
also i wanted something to put in fridge so have cold water to drink . 
any thing that is bass heavy ,  i d have to lower the volume to remove the distortion . 
this is a wonderful gift for any cook . 
it ll keep drinkable hot for a few hours even ,  depending on air temp and what s in it . 
if you want to make  boat shaped  french potatoes or carrots ,  this is the knife of choice . 
it won t do wheat grass or other types of greens similar to that . 
with these tongs at the grill ,  my husband doesn t even need a grill mitt . 
love the perfect fit and slightly nubby surface . 
there have been no signs of rust  even with the dishwasher  . 
than hold the opening where the finished grinds container goes over the filter basket and tap the grounds out . 
it lets me pause ,  skip forward or backward on music tracks . 
the handle feels friendly ,  a little softness to the squeeze; yet very well constructed . 
all in all ,  very happy with the purchase . 
i d like to say this thing works exceptionally well for my purposes . 
i don t like to grill with mitts or gloves ,  so i have to pay attention to heat transfer . 
if it does break ,  i will definitely write an update . 
you re not going to mix a ten gallon vat of pancake batter with it . 
an outdoor grill was out of the question . 
it is not fancy like the blue antz headsets ,  but it is more than adequate . 
but i have to admit this is a pretty decent looking bookshelf . 
it s also great to use in the microwave for melting butter ,  chocolate ,  etc . 
it does well in protecting your phone when you drop it . 
that is all the selling point i needed . 
will update down the road as i have had more opportunities to use it !  . 
it will just take a little getting used to . 
i will be looking at their dehydrators next . 
looks nice next to a macbook or imac . 
however ,  if you are an average joe phone user ,  this case will give you all the protection you need . 
one wonders ,  however ,  if the relatively high price is merited . 
i ve used jolly time s % organic yellow popping corn with num_num tbs . 
it easily snapped on and she did not even know it was on . 
if you don t think microwave or air popped corn is the real thing ,  this is the best popper around . 
i no longer worry about their fingers getting caught in the beaters . 
the first time i used it ,  and every time since ,  my panini came out perfectly . 
it s spring now ,  and the farmers market with all its great local produce isn t far along . 
it works pretty good ,  but not as well as i d hoped . 
as long as it lasts a couple of years ,  we are happy . 
but it is really cute ,  and it works as advertised . 
it is removable and you can move it to either loop . 
this is probably the best knife i ve owned . 
the iphones have poor battery life ,  and the atrix bettery life is even shorter . 
i first bought it to hang next to the large skillet; as a joke . 
i would not use metal utensils on this even though the manufacturer says it is ok . 
this replaces a bakertowne that finally broke after many many years . 
someone wrote on their review that these were not lead crystal . 
i use it without the infuser most often for coffee or hot chocolate . 
also being so thick is should be less likely to break . 
connects faster than the num_extend and is one of the best bluetooths i ever tried . 
there are two reasons for the num_num stars instead of num_extend
one sink has more plumbing under it and the other one just ties into the first one . 
all in all i really like this dehydrator . 
radio shack wanted $ for an num_extend battery with a charger . 
its blends thoroughly and to a smooth texture . 
roomba is light easy to carry and you don t have to push any thing around . 
the blade is also very sharp and makes easy prep of my vegetables . 
then your bowl is free and spinnable ,  and your mixer isn t keeling backwards . 
my mom had one that you could use in softer ice cream without cleaning the utensil after every plunge . 
 :    :   this will be easier to form them ,  instead of making them by hand . 
for a product at this price i call that a rock solid performer . 
it will be down to it s beautiful shine in no time . 
i didn t want to add to the girth of the phone and lose that feature . 
its so good in this price ,  it protect my i phone . 
this came and i used it right away . 
i own the foodsaver vacuum food sealer system . 
one thing though ,  we have a large family and make many pancakes at a time . 
what s not to like ?  i ve got started baking and wanted to try making my own english muffins . 
i use these for basic cooking and baking . 
the slide out keyboard opens up on mine with the case on . 
just draw the blade fairly smoothly through the slot  no pauses  . 
i bought two sets and now hang lids and extra utensils . 
i purchased this to make a cheese sauce that i didn t have to watch over while cooking dinner . 
cheaper than what you would pay in store . 
i love the colors and they work well for light weight items and small bags !  . 
it s so much easier to use this juicer than to juice by hand . 
this is particularly important if ,  like me ,  you store your fruit in the fridge . 
like four small warm chocolate chip cookies on a fancy little plate after a bad day . 
these were shipped super fast ,  and arrived in great condition . 
the coffee tastes great and is nice and hot . 
i had a few others but this one does it all thank you . 
i only trust my cell phone screens with skinomi . 
i cannot say enough about the quality of the sharpener . 
deals with a case ,  charger ,  screen protector ,  etc . 
i get this replacement filter every num_num months for my blueair num_num model . 
as long as i keep my trips relatively short ,  that is . 
these glasses are by far the best i ve ever used in my lifetime . 
i bought this because i wanted something that wasn t to flashy and would hold up well . 
i ordered a whole set of these in assorted colors . 
this is the spatula you ve been looking for !  it is very thin and extremely flexible . 
should order num_num packs so they last the full num_num years of phone use . 
too small for beer pong ,  but perfect for moving from apt . 
i also have another spare battery with that same model number and that works great too . 
i doubt it will come off any time soon . 
my area doesn t have lte coverage yet but i m able to get a strong fast connection now . 
all the dough ,  sauce and cheese wiped right off the pan with ease . 
the smell fills the house and drives us crazy . 
i used them just today to make biscotti . 
so i decided i wanted a horizontal breadpan . 
it seems reasonably well constructed but i m sure it s not waterproof . 
people don t know i am on a car speakerphone ,  think i am just talking into phone normally . 
it powers through even the toughest pet stains and leaves absolutely no pet odor in the carpets . 
after several passes on the sharpener ,  my nearly rounded edges came out quite sharp . 
in general ,  it takes about num_extend minutes to cook num_num cups of rice . 
waiting to get this one next or the cascade pan . 
while the phone dropped i seen a couple of pieces fly and didn t know what it was . 
this is perfect and the cable is long enough to sit the phone out of the way . 
i really like how it seperates the volume up and down buttons as well as the power button . 
these are quite powerful for how small they are . 
hahaha .  .  .  . i believe they didn t do on purpose .  .  . i sent email again ,  the respond again very quickly and they sent again . 
even better amazon has this cup on a num_num for num_num promotion ,  so you get num_num free . 
it stays on any size pot or pan just fine . 
here s to hoping that it ll hold up even longer after we invest in the parts !  . 
i freeze leftovers and my husband takes them to work and can reheat them in the same dish . 
they were shipped in num_num days . great price for a stylus that works . 
you don t have to stand over a stove and watch the eggs . 
it is much more pen like than the rubber type tips . 
it does charge the device ,  but very slowly ,  and no other functionality . 
it shows off the phone itself ,  but keeps it protected as long as you have screen protectors . awesome purchase . 
i like the skins though so i need to wash my potatoes more thoroughly . 
it is not long enough for dresses ,  as another reviewer said . 
works just as good as the heavy duty silver fans . 
i m not going to repeat the technical specifications . 
during day i have lr blowing out and br in ,  and at night i reverse them . 
we ve found that the ones with wood handles tended to absorb stains and flavors ,  over the years . 
it pulls in a fair amount of air . 
i was told that the unit was still under warranty . 
got here sooner than i expected and was well worth the wait and the price . 
this is not one of those !  this mount is solid . 
i bought the red cover to go with it ,  and it looks great . 
that came in handy a couple of days ago when i gave myself a hangnail . 
the switch broke on the second one after num_extend years . 
this product is works perfect and i love the style of it . 
have had a few compliments on it as well ;  . 
french pressed coffee is simply the best way to brew . 
i purchased the charger for car ,  specifically for my samsung galaxy num_extend
i bought mine a couple years ago and i love it . 
all the different sizes and the two different sides . 
i lost my paring knife in a divorce . 
this will ensure a long life of no stick easy use . 
in this case ,  $ is the first time i ve found that to be difficult . 
it blends liquids poorly ,  especially in large quantities ,  since it isn t meant to do that . 
since it is so large ,  i have found that it is perfect for make homemade chicken or vegetable broth . 
this is a big mistake on amazon s part . 
however ,  i found they were always in use so i bought this set . 
the spices sold in the stores are in different shaped and size jars . 
then there was the special double sided tape needed . 
i recently read that the king arthur flour folks use this machine exclusively in their test kitchen . 
nothing has peeled off or broken ,  it s very well made and holds up to my whisking without fail . 
the only negative i can think of is that it makes it way too easy to eat fried foods . 
it doesn t really ever need cleaning  just make sure you dump our residual kernels before the next batch  . 
i liked it enough to buy a spare . 
with an easy grip handle it makes coring an apple a piece of cake . 
i like that you do not have to unscrew the top in order to pour . 
i did not purchase the chairs in the photo above ,  just the table . 
great case but crack at the bottom due to putting more than num_num cards in . 
it spins easily and the spices that were included are good as well . 
i like this little kitchen device !  it takes most of the guess work out of bacon . 
right where the cord connects the charger , it tends to fray and the wires beome exposed . 
this makes it impossible to remove the bread pan when it is hot . 
macro lens is crap but the fish eye is nice . 
saves a lot of space in my car and office . 
the bonus part is that it will protect your phone without the case being too bulky . 
i absolutely loved my zo bakery but after num_num years of almost daily use the heating element was going . 
chunky soup ,  cracking eggs to scramble ,  ice cream ,  a small salad ,  olives ,  etc . 
the infuser doesn t work all that well but this thing will keep your tea hot all day . 
it s stretchy and soft so it stays on with out being too tight . 
no mess from pans ,  and num_extend secs and you got eggs . 
i believe in using protectors on my cell phones and tablets . 
if you have larger hands ,  you may well have trouble with it . 
i ordered an extra gasket just in case  :   always better to keep extra gaskets . 
they feel hefty in your hand and are easy to lock closed and unlock when they re needed . 
i definately recomand these to anyone who love their phone . 
knives are a little flexible but better then most at this price . 
visit   .  .  .   for more info . the only downside to this pitcher is that it does not have an airtight seal . 
what a buy !  this is a good sized pot for preparing soups . 
went to the store to take a look and came running back to amazon to purchase . 
as i was in need of a new coffee maker i started looking around and reading reviews . 
if you don t want to get a grinder ,  still buy whole beans and grind them at the supermarket . 
i got it on sale i m really happy with it . 
if you have carpets vacuuming is not enough . 
this cooker is a pleasant surprise ,  because none of these problems happen with this presto . 
it fits into my purse or even in a pocket . 
make sure you check your connections before you buy this . 
most voice commands were received correctly by both phones . 
brought a lot more usage back to a phone . 
perhaps weird but straight bacon in the morning makes me happy . 
as much as i hate plastic ,  i didn t experience any odor or taste as some others have . 
this pan is great and makes a very pretty cake . 
the coffee brews directly into a stainless steel thermal carafe . cleanup is some work . 
my niece and her new husband like their wedding gift . 
i ve always wanted one and i m so happy that i finally bought it . it s simply amazing . 
about this phone ,  i have only num_num complaint . 
haven t made pizza with it yet but i imagine that will be great too !  . 
who doesn t know pyrex ?  this size is heavy and a bit unwieldy ,  but that s the nature of the beast . 
so with that i will drop my overall rating to a num_num star . 
they are heavy ,  sturdy ,  great for the freezer  they frost nicely  . 
no matter whose providing our cell phone service ,  dead zones still seem to be an issue . 
good grip and protects the phone for sure tho . 
yes ,  has seven different screens unlike the original droid which came with three . 
for the cheap price it functions just as we ll if not better than the more expensive ones . 
they recommend cleaning the unitas needed with a drip coffee maker . 
cooking meat spatters ,  so almost every inch of this rack is covered with grease . 
inexpensive and fast shipping at a resonable price . 
great item if you own a samsung galaxy phone and your charging port stops working . 
this filter came free with my new mr . 
  .  .  .  the bold s camera was a surprise to me . 
but again ,  the customer service was great and far exceeded my expectations . 
it wipes clean easily ,  and is very sturdy . 
my wife loves these and i have to admit they are pretty . 
fully wet the sticky side of the film as well ,  but don t spray the liquid on the phone itself . 
i definitely recommend this product to evo shift owners . 
i m sure i ll use it sometime when i rearrange furniture or move it to another room . 
it does what it said it would do . 
keeps my mixer dust free ,  without having to store the whole thing in a cupboard between uses . 
yep battery life is a problem with most pda phones . 
would look fine on a shelf or desk ,  in a bathroom ,  almost anywhere . 
isn t the oven setting correct ?  well ,  at times it isn t . 
it provides great height for my plants to grow and the seal is super tight . 
product performs great and was avery reasonable price . 
the bumper is easy to put on or remove . 
i am brutal on headsets due to my line of work  carpenter  . 
some of the problems people have had with the lid ,  i have not experienced . 
the first filter i received from shop deals usa was much smaller and extremely lite . 
just put the slab of meat in the freezer for a few hours and slice away . 
magnet is excellent at holding knifes with a large surface area . 
i did not use any egg or oil in the mix . 
you can also adjust the vent to help control the flame and how much heat is being put out . 
i originally used the verizon screen protector ,  but recommend the zagg . 
it has definitely helped me out ,  works great !  . 
next morning or whenever ,  you have a vitamin rich drink . 
its nothing more than advertised ,  great spare charger to have around . 
but i m not sure if there is a better  dishwasher safe  way to design the lid . 
my kids are drinking green smoothies ,  because there is no problem having everything frozen and blended smoothly and quickly . 
all of the pans stack together so i have more cabinet space . 
seals tight and locks so thats great just in case you knock it over or drop it . 
i handwashed the lid and bowl so i ve no idea how it handles a dishwasher . 
a previous reviewer mentioned how quickly it works ,  and he s right !  . 
all in all this pan is well constructed ,  and will give you many years of service . 
all connections between the case and your phone are soft . 
was unsure if this would actually work better than a standard balloon whisk ,  but was pleasantly surprised . 
i have this set of spoons ,  along with the regular rsvp measuring spoons . 
after this ,  i m not sure i d go back to an electric one again . 
maybe if we put num_num scoops in we d see an overflow of grounds ? no drips or leaks from the carafe . 
i got the item on a friday sale for num_extend so i guess i cant complain . 
we used it on the board and it did a great job . 
anyways ,  if your looking for an alternative to the expensive ram solutions ,  this is it . 
wow ,  lots of unhappy reviews about the lid . 
they make jerky all the time and love it . 
even better ,  you can find it in department stores everywhere . 
a lot better design from num_extend i love the slide power button . 
reccomended to me by andrew whaley of coffeeboy . 
i just wish i would have bought one years ago . 
no longer will i be stuck with a mere num_num gb of storage . 
and speaking of firmware ,  i haven t checked to see if num_extend is available in the u . s . 
have given one to each of my children and plan to give more as gifts to new cooks . 
i is a very good price and does its job well . 
don t put cocoa powder in % milk before frothing . 
i m not sure if that s just a fluke or not . 
if you are looking for a good reliable charger ,  i would recommend this item . 
although my experience with bluetooth is very limited ,  i am impressed with this one . 
my visor is thick and the slip on holder for the ikross won t stay . 
forget the num_extend generation ,  this grandpa does the job better . 
came on time and just as described ,  i might buy a few colors for myself !  . 
i ve always had good luck with hamilton beach products . 
i find it somewhat entertaining that these forums show a good degree of brand fanaticism . 
if you have the stock music app running ,  it works flawlessly . 
in general ,  i still like the case and still think it is a good value for the money . 
easy to install and if the need arises ,  easy to remove also . 
however because of the design of the bars some boards will not sit flush to the wall . 
the handle is firmly attached ,  to help keep everything steady as you fill jars . 
i tore mine removing it from my pocket so be careful with those . 
and to think that i used to content myself with instant coffee !  !  !  . 
the cutouts keep your control buttons and camera lens usable . 
this case is perfect for the iphone num_extend
it s kind of hard to unhook once it s closed . 
there s really not much to say about this particular item other than it works well and as described . 
i ve made excuses for it ,  but now i realize it s the weakest aspect of this phone . 
parts like this either work or they don t ,  and leave you frustrated for wasting your time . 
bonus ,  even a klutz like me can t break these bowls . 
samsung branded so you know it works good and it does . 
most people have no idea i m using a headset . 
it s not thing so great but it does protect the headset when not wearing it . 
by the way ,  this charger is motorola brand ,  but it charges all devices that have the micro usb port . 
it is very easy to slip under over easy eggs with out breaking them . 
its a beautiful design ,  however as it was at a discount store ,  it included no packaging or instructions . 
easy to install ,  just peel off the paper andpress onto to wall . 
i still use the old one with the  shortened  handle ,  too . 
hope it will fix all the problems and i will fall in love with it again !  . 
in that brief moment in time ,  your pulse quickens and your bp rises . 
i have had this press for a couple of weeks now and i use it every day . 
the power indicator is very convenient to know charge pack status . 
i used it to peel an apple ,  and it worked great !  i didn t know that peelers could do that . 
yeah baby .  .  !  and the chickens love it too !  . 
recommend this for anyone who uses their brita filter system . 
the blade attachment works very quickly and as i said quietly . 
the firmware update shifted the camera performance from abysmal to very average . 
am i paying more for the brand name rather than the product ?  . 
i always make sure to put a light coat of oil on the pan after i use it . 
as the sole coffee drinker here ,  i swear the first cup is the best ever . 
gently squeeze out the bubbles ,  and then remove the top protective sheet ,  and you re done . 
also when i have breakfast in bed they fit perfectly on the serving tray . 
i should have looked at a ruler to see how long num_extend inches was . 
commercial is the handles ,  which on the pro do get very hot very fast . 
there were ,  of course ,  the traditional can openers . 
in the same respect ,  never put your food into this pan when the pan is cold . 
this knife is really ,  really sharp and holds an edge well . 
my husband likes popcorn and makes it quite often . 
the color changing text is interesting ,  but staring at it would not be a good idea while driving . 
the only problem we have is that if the lid gets mixed up with the other shaker ,  it leaks . 
find the device on your phone and it pairs within a second or two . 
every woman in our family num_extend now  has received a gift of a kitchenaid . 
i have a white and a black  bulk packaging  . 
i get about num_extend charges on my iphone num_num from the charger . 
it stays on fine ,  but it picks up a lot of background noise . 
this is a perfectly good full cover to protect your investment . 
this egg cooker works well and makes perfect soft and hard boiled eggs . 
i really can t think of anything negative to say about it . 
this strainer has just the right size mesh for straining puddings . 
did a good job of cleaning up my cluttered spice cabinet and for that i give it num_num stars . 
if you want your inner box to be intact when you get these ,  please order from another seller . 
turns out they take twice the time to charge your phone and break twice as fast . 
turn that damned light off for something a little more subtle . 
we live in a renovated basement and our closet is just a bar hanging from the support beams . 
they are extremely sharp ,  cut well ,  and have a very comfortable grip . 
i would buy this product again and will continue to buy oxo products !  . 
but its a good headphone for the price and for its use . 
if i can put a fork in easily ,  the fish is usually done . 
i bought this product a week back and it performs great . 
to simply remedy ,  i took scissors and cut the opening a bit larger . 
i think this amounts to a matter of opinion . 
it is heavy and a little bigger than i wanted ,  but couldn t be happier anyway . 
the pans have made me a much better cook !  . 
i also have the num_num and num_num liter along with small ones . 
it just does not inspire confidence that a more solid contact would impart . 
all the buttons match up ,  and the color is the exact same . 
it s already saved my phone once ,  when dropped . 
all holes and good and buttons are easy to press . 
directions as well as trying other techniques found posted on the internet . 
i like this because its not real heavy like the one i used to have . 
i bought this for my girlfriend ,  who has hearing loss ,  and wears hearing aids as a consequence . 
the earlier plantronics was also very good as well . 
i mill my own flour ,  so was a bit skeptical regarding how this oven would bake the pizza . 
ver high quality finish and feel to it . 
it works fine without installing the water filter . 
i actually like that the clasps are a little tight because then you know they won t accidentally open . 
i ve had my unit for years and love it . 
my prior homeowner left one of these on the dryer when they moved out . 
i contacted the seller and to their credit ,  they immediately sent two new ones which work well . 
still loving my phone and android period ;  i hope you will too . 
it s a good product and i ve given it as a gift for friends . 
bought a spare battery ,  haven t charged my phone is soooooooo long . 
i lay the lids on loosely for microwaving . 
these knives are the best i ever bought . 
i reasearched for hours what wok to buy on youtube . 
i do not have to prepare food in another area when using the microwave . 
so ,  that s just a little general pasta machine info . 
fortunately ,  i looked at the old one first before i ruined this one . 
this little gizmo will charge my phone from dead to full three times on one charge . 
i then purchased one through sears and am very impressed with it . 
very pleased ,  after boiling turning the heat to simmer it makes a good tasting full bodied cup of coffee . 
it appears to be extremely high quality and very well designed . 
i wouldn t recommend it to anyone shopping for a headset . 
so ,  order today because oxo s exacting standards sometimes make it difficult to keep up with consumer demand . 
for the iphone num_extend you have to make sure that that the bluetooth is on . 
this dutch oven is exactly the right one to own . 
it does exactly what it is supposed to do and does it very easily . 
i expect kitchen gadgets to come with recipes ,  and was surprised when this one did not . 
the only complaint i have is that the handle is way too short . 
my only complaint is that it sticks a bit when retracting ,  otherwise it s a num_extend
we ve always  ground  beans in a blade grinder but it s impossible to produce a uniform grind . 
the rounded edges and chrome trim give it a more upscale feel . 
amazon vine review : i ve been switching back and forth between plantronics backbeat and motorola num_extend for a couple years now . 
i just baked a chocolate cake num_extend in num_num minutes !  you would absolutely never know the difference . 
everything cleans up so quickly ,  in the dishwasher or by hand . 
this is my first rectangular one ,  and i like it a lot better than the round ones . 
fits well ,  does not stick to screen well . 
just bought this processor last week and i m already in love with it . 
not just for the htc but for any phone that takes a usb adapter for charging . 
this how ever seems to be a beast . 
i am using this for an htc thunderbolt and it fits it perfectly . 
i ve had expensive machines ,  cheap machines ,  major brands and generics . 
until the iphone came out ,  needed another battery to keep it going . 
i ll recommend this product to anyone looking to experience music like never before . 
it s easy to clean ,  either by hand or in the dishwasher ,  and it keeps our microwave really clean . 
i may never have to pull out my large num_num cup cuisinart num_extend ever again . 
i bought this as a supplement to a kerosene jet heater that i also use in my garage . 
just turn on the ikross ,  go the setting on the iphone and turn on bluetooth . 
the grind settings are reliable and produce uniform results a very attractive feature is the lack of mess . 
i have had no negative issues with use . 
hard to adjust the amount of soap to dispense . 
 a feature i did not know it could do when i ordered it .   . 
i bought this shelf to organize my bathroom counter with . 
it requires a larger bowl to blend flour and butter . 
no complaints and you can listen to your music as well . 
think of this as a tiny laptop computer ,  not a cell phone . i bought the seidio num_num mah battery . 
i put my griffin bumper back on and it didn t bubble like my previous one . 
im very happy with my purchase and would buy these again !  . 
these things make using the larger ipad very easy . 
got for a christmas gift for my grandson . 
i have had zero issues with this mixer . 
i didn t treat this little pot particularly well ,  and boiled it dry more than once ,  but always worked great . 
i use this cooker more than my range top or oven . 
these were great also ,  but they are not clad up the sides . 
i wanted to find a good ,  durable blender for use at home . 
and the people on the other end of the call like this headset a lot better . 
but in our world today we rely on power to make many of our tools to work . 
i m used to putting food in a hot pan and immediately losing a bunch of heat . 
this product offers some protection and a zebra design . 
it takes a lot less shelf space in my refrigerator than my previous brita pitcher . 
when cooks illustrated recommends it ,  it s nearly always excellent . 
this blade works well for chopping veggies for a salad like cole slaw . 
you can sync two phones at once which is a plus for me . 
the best results ever and easy to take care of . 
stainless  facade  on the front and sides is very nice tho the matte black unit looks very nice too . 
on to the review .  .  . the pot lid is very ,  very heavy . 
my last kitchenaid cover lasted over num_num years and lots of washes . 
dc flat screen tv for our travel trailer ,  i bought a regular one and picked this inverter up . 
great fit for the phone and high quality construction make this an excellent bargain . 
it s not a replacement for a full sized vacuum ,  but it is a very good daily cleaner . 
what can you say  bout a pan ?  it works . 
i hope this will not crumble over time ,  because i really love it . 
it provides good protection for the phone and has room for the extended battery . 
this is a great size ,  easy to operate ,  beautiful look on the counter . 
now i simply leave in it my oven and set pans on it when i am baking something . 
since we eat a lot of fruit around my house ,  this is an item that gets a real workout . 
it is worth it however as the leftovers come out very very dry . 
the best paring knife i have every had . 
it is also very easy to clean either by hand or in a dishwasher . 
forget pounding unless the recipe calls for it . 
this screen protector  the package contains num_num of them  is of good quality . 
but you can t use boiling water ,  for obvious num_extend
this is great for my large breville toaster oven . 
this set of ear plugs does wonders for me . 
i bought num_num and gave them away as gifts  !  !  !  . 
i like the feel of it ,  the size  width  of it ,  and the color . 
we ve had these things since the little ones first came out . 
the shocks at the treadmill are yet to be tried out . 
what so great about that ? you don t put it away . 
before ,  with the microwave popcorn ,  i had to wash the oil off my hands when we were done . 
a spinner any smaller than the oxo would not hold a head of romaine or green leaf lettuce . 
so far a month from usage it s still good as new . 
i am pleased with the size and the way it saves the coating on my pans . 
we found that each setting was within five degrees of the indicated setting except for highest . 
i use it for making biscuits and it s just what i wanted . makes great pie crusts ,  too . 
they are nice and sturdy as well ,  not the cheap flimsy ones . 
these are fun to use when making cookies . 
i use this for my meat and other food thta i wanna keep fresh and it works amazing . 
i bought this electric kettle about two years ago and still love it . 
i tried many times to glue them but they still break easily afterwards . i still haven t seen a better holder . 
we used to knife to remove scale ,  but this one is much better than knife . 
i am all about bins ,  and they are perfect for storing bins . 
the first holder works well when my iphone num_num has no bumpers of any kind . 
it has a normal good size fan noise that i don t find irritating . 
the magnetic smart switch in the cover isn t as good as the apple factory cover . 
this was a gift but as far as i know ,  they are very happy with it . 
as a side note ,  putting it together after taking out of the box was very easy with included instructions . 
ateco is a great brand and this offset is reliable . 
i would suggest for a cheap git or yourself . 
and have given many sets as gifts  greatly appreciated  . 
they all make coffee but so few have the shutoff . 
i have scratched it ,  cleaned it with a metal scrubber and it still works great . highly recommend . 
works like a charm and looks good on our kitchen counter . 
we used it day and night during a num_num week cleanse . 
unfortunately ,  these do warp after a long time use . 
so if your looking for a change sure i would recommend this . 
i like the teflon coating on the screw and the fact that it s dishwasher safe . 
this stylus is wonderful to use ,  when it s new . 
i found this product to be a great value and the service was great with this vendor . 
this is really great at getting everything out of the mixing bowl and smoothing cakes and icings . 
besides of that i like the quality of the music and the phone calls . 
it must double the thickness of the phone . 
i ve had this product for some time ,  and i ve been nothing but impressed by it . 
it s my first amazonbasics ,  but the styling and features are anything but basic !  . 
it really gets the dirt and pet hair . 
the quality on the other end is very clear . 
now i m looking for recipe s where i need an immersion blender . 
i bought this for my brother and he s so happy with it . 
just like my parent s had when i was a kid . 
i think i paid num_num cents for this . 
the retraction part doesn t work as well as i think it could ,  but it gets the job done . 
they have wide models and another shape i think ,  didn t need them . 
oh yea it gives you a wifi hot spot too from you data package . 
the buttons on the phone don t lend well to alarm clock functions because of their size and location . 
it was so easy and so much fun . 
i gave the protector a real work out my playing my gem drop game for about num_num min . 
i see nothing wrong with the way they slice in spite of what another reviewer said . 
if you re looking for something that will last over time then this is it . 
once the grilling was done ,  i waited until it was cold and wiped it with soapy sponge . 
the only issue i have is that it doesn t come with a lid . 
finding a way to use the long arms to hold the actual phone can also be a challenge . 
the seller was wonderful and got them to me long before the promised shipment date . 
i love to bake cakes ,  so i m not sure why i waited so long to buy one of these . 
this was only one of two sets that i found that met all three of those criteria . 
the card holder is a great bonus as well . 
goes over the area rug in our bedroom which is on carpet ,  with great ease . 
however in comparison to another similar product that i ordered this one has a few things going for it . 
just bought a new one to have a new one . 
i had try several kind of bluetooth and this is the only one that has worked perfect for me . 
this replaced a backberry she got from a friend when she dropped her origional . 
easy to learn to use the different features . 
apple s num_num pin connector  and this cable is no different . 
this iphone made cord will work with any standard num_extend jack . 
it was a bit spendy for a can opener ,  but it should last a long time . 
i got two of these aero beds for my kids . 
now i hit every one i go after . 
i d rate it a num_extend but the parts are plastic and i m not sure yet ,  if they will last . 
i have a verizon iphone num_num and this cover works well with it . 
it is a clean crack with the separated pieces fitting together without gaps . 
so if you have  little ones  around or clumsy hands ,  use with caution and store carefully . 
it takes longer to clean that it takes to grind the coffee . 
it chops very well to any desired amount of chop . 
most importantly it fits easily on either ear with just a quick adjustment and is pretty comfortable . 
i got two and they both fit good in the closet . 
i swear by this company and buy nothing else . 
this really should have come with the phone ,  but since it didn t ,  this is a good buy . 
no problem ,  i just used it with a regular filter and no lid . 
this extra iphone battery does give you an extra num_num to % spare capacity compared with an iphone alone . 
much better than the more expensive kitchenaid blender it replaced . 
we payed $ then and worth the money . 
the ice cream was firm ,  but was not so hard that the scoop should have broken . 
please keep in mind that these are a bit smaller than what most people might like . 
now ,  i can simply touch the head set ,  say  call home ,   and the phone starts ringing . 
and ,  in the past ten years the popularity of cast iron pans has increased every year . 
you could leave it out on the counter displaying your cookbook . 
even temps ,  mostly ,  and cleans up easy ,  even with eggs . 
it never tangles for me ,  has good body . 
this wok may be pricier than other similar appliances ,  but it is worth it . 
if you are thinking of buying these go ahead and buy them . 
they only thing is that it is hard to get off sometimes but other than that i love it . 
other then that ,  they are exactly what i expected . 
in all actuality ,  you can probably achieve the same cut with a pair of scissors and micro sim template . 
this is very sturdy and no longer have that problem . 
this shirt is very light weight and so comfortable . 
fits the griddle and does what it is supposed to do . 
i purchased this case because it had the best and highest rated reviews on amazon . com . 
pizzazz rules !  !  !  ! plus its in black my fave color . 
perhaps a better deal depending on what is on sale at the time . 
the other brand only provided partial charge on the phone and even less on the ipad . 
i can t take calls and can t adjust the music volume through the piece attached to the headphones . 
it makes my phone look like new even though i ve had it awhile . 
chargers disappear and break in my house all the time . 
after using this for a while ,  it is really helpful . 
i ordered this with the new coffee maker and it works well . 
the icarrier is square and just over an inch thick . 
no amount of fiddling could get the headset to sit right . 
some of my sealed weights leaked after several dives and had to be redone . 
still a timesaver if you re used to molding them in the pan with regular tongs . 
i put in the oven and no problems . 
chicken ,  hamburgers ,  hotdogs and steaks all came out great . 
if you are registering for a wedding or another occasion ,  definitely pop this one on your list . 
and the mute feature  pushing both volume buttons at once  was confirmed with a tone . 
the benefit here is that there is some spongy material to absorb the shock if you iphone drops . 
a quarter  us  slipped under the corner works perfectly to stabilize the case . 
it s thin material and does not necessary look like it will last a lifetime . 
it s a little big but everything i needed for my office . 
combined with an otterbox  commuter  phone case has my new iphone totally protected . 
it has the same os as the num_extend
fits perfectly in a true half size baking sheet . 
it cuts effortlessly through tough root vegetables and slices tomatoes paper thin . 
we bought these so our guests could have ice water in their rooms . 
wow !  i poured my comparison cup of coffee made in the bunn down the sink . 
i d rather bake at home than buy anything that tastes like they didn t clean the sheet pans between bakings . 
and if you are using your note num_num as a gps ,  it will barely maintain the current charge . 
i have had my first one for about num_num years and it still looks brand new . 
well the num_num was not worth it so we returned it and got this one . 
i have several friends that still use theirs . 
no complaints and will buy more when needed . 
this was only the touch screen and not the rear lcd screen . 
 very easy to do  turned it on at num_num pm on high and closed the bedroom door . 
i love my so much ,  i got one for all the secretaries in my husband s office . 
the premium crystal clear screen protectors for the droid num_extend work very well and are a perfect fit . 
all three are excellent products ,  without doubt .  .  . we have num_num homes and use them frequently . 
if the price is too high ,  i m sure you can find a cheaper cooker that will do the job . 
i bought one of the num_extend extended batteries from ebay since the seidio ones are so expensive . 
i would recommend this to anyone in the market for food processor . 
you can mix ,  bake  ziti  ,  and refrigerate in these . 
when viewing video the latency makes it so the sound and the moving lips almost ,  but not quite match . 
you can turn anything into long thin strips . 
i bought this one really for the handle trying to make it easier for me to cut things . 
most will just pop them in a bag ,  purse or pocket . 
doesn t get any simpler to use ,  worked great ,  and it also looks nice on the desktop . 
if you need one of these cords ,  this is the one to get !  . 
some places still supply this as a spare part . 
fit into my phone with no problems and into my computer also with no problems at all . 
i can only assume it is a good product . 
this was a positive experience although i still feel like a traitor to frugality for buying it . 
the fingers that grip your phone do an admirable job . 
it is a great design with a great feel . 
the misto sprays just enough oil so the pepper and yeast  stick  . 
it cooks wonderfully and the rolled ,  high sides make cooking even easier and cleanup is easy too . 
this is all i ever need for myself . 
no big deal as i just remove my phone from the cover when i want to dock it . 
it takes about two minutes for my old capresso to turn out a decent cup of coffee . 
i purchased this model ,  because the blade is held in place with two screws . 
the plugs all fit well and the charger does the job . 
i would only use it if i was out of paper filters . 
i d recommend this to a friend for sure . 
this is a very good spatula to use with stainless steel or iron skillets . 
the color went beyond pretty and it looks great . 
still ,  i love using fresh spices ,  so a little extra clean up effort is ok by me . 
i was desperate for something that would keep food hot all day ,  not luke warm . 
i have other zeroll scoops and the handles are all color coded for the different sizes . 
i don t even remember what was wrong with the other one ,  but we got the same thing again . 
this is my third pressure cooker and i love this one the best . 
i use these when i ride my bike . 
this ear phone is very good and i recommend it to all of you . 
these are rally great one arrived with a broken handle . 
i upgraded from the num_extend num_extend  also a seriously great phone  to this . 
however ,  we normally just brew num_num cups a day . 
bought for my sons iphone num_extend and fits like a glove . 
the  ballistic  case for samsung infuse num_extend is very solid . 
one for my daughter and one for myself . 
having misplaced my first oxo steel cocktail shaker ,  i bought a different brand . 
i read that and thought it silly since i never vacuum in the dark . 
but i had so many from other phones that i just used the other ones . 
you can see what is inside and how much !  old time fun again . 
it picked up three times the moisture from the carpet than the eureka . 
i got this for my son who is putting food up for bad times . 
for example ,  the output of the oem charger for the nexus one is num_num amp  i . e . 
the phone fits perfectly ,  and is easy to slide in and out . 
ive ordered alot of screen protectors and these are by far the best . 
the num_extend forces me to make an adaptation . 
the dish has high sides which i like so i can put lots of filling in my pies . 
the only thing i found myself despising was the the tail s inability to stick for prolonged periods of time . 
not much to say about a measuring cup .  .  . it measures liquids accurately . 
i like this product because it is simple to use . 
well ,  the fat does drip continuously ,  but the poultry and meats cooked in the rotisserie are plenty greasy . 
the lids are sold separately or there appears to be another version of this pan with a lid . 
so far it works and fits in car charger perfectly . 
if you ve ever held a samsung galaxy num_extend with a zerolemon num_extend battery on it ,  you know it s heavy . 
it won t fit on a charging dock ,  i don t think . 
this very simple stand has a lot going for it . 
there s this voice that will tell you it is turned on and the state of your battery . 
screen protector went on fine with no bubbles . 
the care oxo takes in design is obvious and the materials involved are superior in every way . 
it was a fraction of the cost of batteries that verizon sells for this phone . 
my toaster sits next to the stove so it tends to get splatted with whatever is cooking . 
i needed a new plug and when i ordered this one i was surprised how soon i got it . 
it works as well as my $ ge wall oven but is faster and uses much less power . 
it took a few times to cook the rice the way we like it . 
this price seems pretty high to me but i do like mine . 
have jack lalane and this is so much better . 
the bag is also very simple to hand wash . 
one made in japan  superb  and one in china  ok  . 
i have dropped my phone with this case on it and nothing happened to it . 
i want to get it in other colors . 
i can whip up flawless batches of bread in large quantities without a strain on the dough hook . 
this is a $ set of knives with a block . 
i just made me a hell of a steak in this last night . 
i decided corelle livingware would be lighter to lift and take up far less storage space . 
i use this accessory for my foodsaver more than any other item . 
i hardly ever use my regular oven anymore so it has helped reduce my electric bill . 
i just received my num_extend coffee team lux coffee maker . 
i don t know what people are finding to complain about !  love this little sandwich maker . 
i use it a lot ,  however ,  and am glad to have it . 
it s the same great quality as the larger lodge skillets . 
they stack perfectly ,  and the shape of them makes them exceptionally easy to use and level . 
it looks like the direct replacement that came in the blender . 
i don t have time to sharpen with a stone . 
growing up ,  we rolled it out on the counter and cut it with a knife or pizza roller . 
i use it for my iphone ,  laptop ,  and speaker system . 
getting really a num_num for num_num deal with the built in usb charger also . 
thought the little food processor might be nice to have too . 
no plastic taste or smell after first use and dumping of test water . 
works for peeling carrots ,  making plantain chips ,  and probably lots of other things . 
takes much less time to heat up ,  which means using less electricity . 
also i find the lid that comes with it to be pretty much pointless . 
you can make from a cup to num_num cups and it automatically turns off when ready . 
after almost two years with this vacuum is it by far the best little sweep vac i ve owned . 
if you have the space to put it on a wall or inside a door ,  that would be better . 
we think this grater is just perfect for our needs . 
i use the regular blade to make dough ,  and it has done an excellent job . 
and even then ,  it s just a small singe ,  not flames or loss of structural integrity . 
if this sounds like too much hassle for you ,  then you might look elsewhere . 
there are six spoons in the set with all the sizes you could want . 
i do shake it a little in addition to the stirring . 
it is not dishwasher safe ,  so ignore the manufacturer s directions at your own risk . 
the spout has a filter in it so that you can pour your drink and leave the ice behind . 
sometimes prone to touch screen failure or vibrate feature failure ,  but still a good phone . 
so i bought the presto pro knife sharpener and was not disappointed . 
considering what you can do with this little food processor ,  and the price ,  it s a pretty good deal . 
the sight glass however ,  does get hot enough to burn . 
this is a fun zebra case for my iphone . 
i bought these for a crab feed that hasn t happened yet . 
i mean i was like they will not be clear ,  loud or work . 
it is one of the best utensils i have ever had . 
sending num_extend pics as mms via tmo ?  cough . 
i ordered this for my sons phone ,  he loves it . 
i bought three of these num_num tspoon ,  num_extend and num_num spoon . 
this is the nicest mount i ve tried yet . 
the button is small ,  lightweight ,  and doesn t interfere with anything . 
the product works as advertised and has not failed so far  after coring out num_num pineapples  . 
i am so glad i finally got a decent machine . 
i knew both of these things before i bought it ,  but it was still a bit of a surprise . 
they sound great .  .  .  . but ,  as with any earbud ,  getting a good sealing fit is critical . 
i was hoping to make long and narrow baguettes . 
we bought this one on the strength of the cooks illustrated and other reviewers  ratings . 
we have tile on the walls and don t want to drill into them to install a shelf . 
i didn t put this in the dryer for fear of shrinkage as other reviewers have noted . 
i received it very fast and its identical to the one that came with my ipod . 
the filters are easy to clean but you do need a new hepa filter every num_num months or so . 
well i found this one easy and great to use . 
i have about num_num that are functional and two or three which are for parts only . 
i used to buy several cheap versions from marshalls ,  retail stores etc . 
we ve had many bread machines but this one is by far the best we ve owed . 
i also like how they fit like a glove and leave way less bubbles than most protectors . 
they was in the dishwasher and come out looking like they did before they were used . 
it keeps me from paying too much for juice prepared by someone else . 
i had none of the problems in the reviews . 
the pressure cooker is much larger than i need . 
by doing so ,  the lid handle should slide into place on top of the pot handle . 
i prefer more customers but it from amazon now . 
but i eventually discovered that those new spoons were not accurate !  made in china ,  of course . 
it keeps the fish moist ,  and reduces any fishy taste . 
the pan has a nice weight ,  and is very sturdy . 
it adds considerable bulk to the phone ,  but i feel like it is well protected from any mishap . 
i like to make waffles on occasions and am not a pro at it by any means . 
it works as expected and i m very pleased with the results . 
there s not much i can say that a few thousand reviewers have not already covered . 
i have had one for the num_num phones i have owned . 
if you leave it on a time  or a spot in between . 
you just swoop  slide  your finger up to increase volume ,  and down to decrease . 
it works with the iphone num_num and the num_extend
the case provides great protection with limited added bulk . 
i used this for several years ,  and it is fine for what it is . 
highly recommended product ,  this is a stockpot you will own and use for a long time . 
be sure to leave enough room to fit the bottom all the way back in . 
i like the  split fan  feature with oscillation that spreads the air flow over a broader area . 
my main issue is with using larger bags . 
i bought this because i live in the cold north and really miss grilling in the winter . 
the stew cooked up fabulously in the new pot . 
fried eggs with little butter never stick once you know how hot to get pan . 
i was skeptical because of the other reviews ,  but this case is great . 
i never thought i would review the sharpening steel for my knives . 
i am glad that i chose this one instead of one of the  traditional  wood boxes i was considering . 
it probably took about num_num to num_num minutes to install . 
check out that video too if you want more info . 
it also works great to stuff banana and small hot peppers . 
all those num_num star reviews can t be wrong . 
it s made for home use ,  but can be used in a campfire . 
filters will not work in this coffee maker ,  as the grinder blades are sitting in the drip basket . 
it was half of the price of this one but we returned it to the store num_num times . 
i ve been putting off getting a mini prep appliance for a long time . 
i also used the on board attachments and found they were convenient . 
and i did not want a coffee maker that spat everywhere . 
i purchased this cookie cutter for my son s upcoming ghost birthday themed party . 
all of them produce heat ,  but this is the handiest heater i have ever used . 
in general ,  brushes don t seem to last very long . 
pairing was cake and my droid num_num was synced in num_num seconds . 
and in truth ,  it wasn t the kind of appliance i d ever thought i d buy . 
so i went onto amazon to find a high quality ,  long lasting can opener . 
well ,  i suppose one can t wax eloquent about a tea infuser . 
it looks almost identical but the other machine just hasn t been cutting it lately . 
the mugs are not flat bottomed so they do hold water from the dish washer after they are washed . 
with a closed lid over the tools they never fall out or get lost . 
and ,  it fits so closely that one of my charging docks will still work with the case on . 
wish i would ve known about flat whisks earlier . 
it s a small price to pay to keep this coffee machine performing as it should . and oh yes . 
on the other setting ,  i like to slice cucumbers paper thin and add some vinegar . 
i repair a lot of iphone s and i d say there s a num_num in num_num chance of getting a defect . 
but it s just a suggestion that does not interfere with the product s function . in general excellent product . 
with the rubber base ,  i have had no issue with it tipping or falling . 
i add herbs and get great tasty spreads . 
my phone is silver with white keys and it looks fine with the black case also . glad i bought it !  . 
i am very happy with this butter keeper . 
expect to spend more money teaching others how to use simple machines properly . 
i am not associated with any company and all opinions are my very own . 
i ordered this because it has a wide base . 
i had to try various approaches befoe i was able to get good yogurt . 
i would like them to be thicker but they do hold up to wear . 
it feels like a tough cover that looks so good ,  you ll forget you have a screen cover at all . 
the rectangle gave them space to use the other half of the griddle for eggs and worked great . 
it has two belt loops and a belt clip . 
i purchased this set of coasters for my father to give my niece as a wedding gift . 
i can still answer calls from my cellphone as well . 
as soon as it arrived ,  i cleaned the bucket and put it in the freezer ,  and checked the parts . 
i make homemade yogurt almost every other day now . 
this is the first processor that i have owned and i am totally ecstatic with it . 
it takes some finesse to get the darn micro usb to fit into the kindle fire ,  but it does . 
they are easy to see and the safety factor is welcome . 
i love these cases .  .  . i ve now had num_num because i am a little rough on them . 
one other thing i recommend is washing the white ring that holds everything together by hand . 
an aspect i like is that it is heavy . 
i have some devices with blue leds that are annoyingly bright . 
the over the head piece is comfortable enough . 
 verizon kept adding features to my contract that i did not ask for ,  they are too big . 
this is small so it fits nicely in his lunch pack and it works great . 
yes it is expensive ,  but well worth it if you entertain . 
best thing about it ?  i ll never have to buy another !  . 
i bought this item over two years ago and used it more than i thought i would . 
saves a lot of dish washing ,  works very well with strong motors . 
and no ,  i didnt even have to do it with a steamy shower running . 
thus far after a couple of weeks it it showing no wear and no air bubbles . 
after reading the reviews here and around the web . 
it is highly recommended and i am telling everyone i know that has iphones about it . 
it is well made and designed to last . 
heated in cheese in micro num_num secs ,  drained ,  repeat until ready to num_extend
aside from that ,  it s exactly what i was looking for ,  cheap ,  light and efficient . 
i will be getting a second set soon !  . 
after a few moments ,  i forget i m wearing them . 
it puts a nice ,  clean ,  sharp edge on a knife . 
all of the flavors of connectors had a male adapter . 
mine was well used and getting a little faded from the years of use . 
this is the best case i have found for verizon s new iphone num_extend
one tip :  only put in a small amount at a time . 
my friend has the same one and she loves hers ,  too !  i recommend it to all of my customers . 
i could delete the songs ,  but not the file folder . 
i know my kids will enjoy this for years to come !  . 
i tried the scoop and it releases quite well ,  keeping my hands far cleaner in the task . 
after some trial and error we found thefarberware classic yosemite stainless steel percolator . 
 :   i intend to buy more of these containers ,  by the way !   . 
i bought this maker after reading reviews on forums . 
the instruction manual has a table of recommended cooking times for specific results . 
just the occasional scrubdown with barkeeper s friend makes these babies shine like new . 
it s not weak like a dust devil and it picks up great ,  including small stones ,  etc . 
the small white plastic piece tends to fall out rather quickly . 
if you re not going to buy a panini grill machine ,  then this is the one to buy . 
pasta dries fairly quickly and is easy to brush out . 
a good price compared to what apple charges for this . 
so easy to use ,  and it cuts below the can glue line . 
my phone battery lasts almost num_num days now without charging depending on how much i use it . 
also ,  no other skillet in the line was deep enough . 
while it doesn t offer as much protection as the otterbox does . 
all in all ,  this battery pack will serve your needs at a fine price and without bulk . 
beats spending $ in store !  the design looks good . 
all that was left after that was the seasoning . 
i just did not want to chance it . 
i bought this for friend in venezuela .  . i used to have it and they knew it was an awesome phone . 
when i saw these measuring cups in the vine newsletter ,  i was delighted . 
used it to cut chicken wings and it went through them like butter . 
then simply place it in the cuisinart and turn on . 
it s excellent on my hard floors especially as i have less furniture . 
we were always trying to find a place on the windshield where it wouldn t block our view driving . 
i m thrilled to be able to retract the cord so it doesn t bend and break . 
i ve had these headphones for the last two years and they have been great . 
i forgot about the circle opening at the bottom that would have to be cut . 
i found it hard to clean without the tool it came with . 
it instead syncs directly from your itunes library folders . 
like most oxo products ,  these are very well made . 
the little windows seem to have a really good seal . i would definitely buy these again at amazon s price . 
it took me a few tries but be patient . it s a great protector ,  though . 
the design is nice and simple and there is a good weight to each glass . 
there is a charging light which is red when charging and green when the battery is full . 
the only thing i recommend is not to over fill your sandwich . 
it keeps the fondue at an even temp and the splash guard protects you from oil burns . 
what a unique solution to a common problem . 
i have been using it for about num_num months with no problems . 
the impressive blade does an excellent job of grinding even to the point of powder should you desire . 
it holds a great edge and slices effortlessly . 
at first it frothed too much ,  so we had to adjust the usage to make it just right . 
i had some concern about scratching some of my screens with the pogo stylus . 
this pan takes the work out of making scones . 
i was a bit concerned that it would be too bulky ,  but those concerns were unfounded . 
only down side is that it is a little bulky . 
at least it doesn t throw up an error message because i am using ios num_extend
she did not thinkj i could beat targets  price on amazon . 
this is perfect for two people or a couple just starting out . 
all you pay for is shipping which is about $ per spice packet ordered . 
i would recommend this product for anyone that keeps their phone on silent at work . 
i have a delonghi num_extend and the smaller size fits very nicely for tamping . 
just sushi ,  mongolian beef or kung pao ,  et . al . 
i tried a num_extend external sata drive with the usb host cable but it didn t work . 
then i thought about this little beauty and decided it was time to get another one . 
i put the blender end in the dish washer and everything comes out nice and sanitized . 
never fill tot he top of the filter and walk away !  . 
no cracking or loosening or trouble of any type . 
apple seeds have arsenic and ground up ,  it gets in you system . 
i was not to excited about using a grater on my feet ,  as i thought it could be dangerous . 
you had to lift the element up  while hot  and try and clear the mess . 
i use them when driving and at the gym . 
this is a cute little version of the larger bodum french presses . generally ,  a good design . 
i wish i searched and found this earlier !  !  ! pros : very good price . 
i received this case after looking for one for three months . 
old battery seemed to be losing power quickly . 
and a num_num ounce tall glass of water or diluted juice is what we all need . 
it s two pieces ,  front and back ,  and is easy to apply ,  but harder to remove . 
the downside is i really didn t need a cord that long . 
even my hunting knives get the best treatment now . 
they are nice and doing the job as intended . 
but the pen clip adapter is the common link to charge the headset . 
i use the first one to grind my almonds everyday . 
it took me num_num minutes to pick the pieces from the grids . 
we live in the world with germs every day not in a bubble or microprocessing manufacturing plant . 
i use them almost every day ,  and these have held up to the dishwasher and constant use . 
overall ,  i m glad i bought it ,  and it was worth the $
messing with cereal boxes is such a pain . 
num_num without much knowledge of making pizzelles . i ve used it several times and it has worked nicely . 
it can stand the abuse of a commercial kitchen . 
this is the version that comes with the charger and the usb cable . 
but this case looks really nice on the phone . 
it quickly cuts the apple into slices and removes the core . 
i like the idea of the smooth side and the notched side ,  all in one . 
the keep up is easily done with the special oil that i would recommend buying . 
best case by far and you can t find a better deal . 
my wife grind more to remove the stains ,  wearing down the glaze faster . 
the largest one will hold a num_num pound sack of sugar ,  but not flour . 
i m not sure why this grinder works so much better than similar items but it does . 
i always have triable keeping my phone from moving when in my sports car . 
we bought this so that we could have an unbreakable french press . 
great battery works well with my lg num_num cellphone . 
great size ,  well made ,  sturdy ,  and even looks nice . 
i m not really sure what the practicality of the lid is . 
this thing is absolutely great !  i love that i have a tub that fills up all the way now . 
the bowl locks in place which is great ,  no need to hold the bowl in place . 
bluetooth was easy to setup and no complains to date . 
only things is it s hard to clean and looks bad where it is handled most . 
not a big problem here ,  i can hear others just fine . 
very cool and stylish case for my iphone . 
someone i know tried to use it for cocktails and ended up breaking it . 
finding it in amazon was a blessing ,  i just love it . 
they asked me when and where did i purchase the unit . 
just perfect for my holiday baking and candy . 
they were the best pork chops we ve ever grilled ,  including those grilled on our bbq . 
nothing is better for creating a stock in no time flat than a pressure cooker . 
the stoppers have a removable top to help with the cleaning process . 
the craftsmanship is obviously inferior to the percolator i owned for num_num years . 
and i d say both units have stainless steel construction of equally high quality . 
the stainless steel is very sturdy ,  and the measurement is very accurate . 
which is just about everywhere you go . please note i purchased this from amazon not a num_extend party . 
i have a white iphone num_num and this screen makes my phone look like a black iphone num_extend
not sure if that s why it lives so long . 
it s also good if you don t have the strongest hand grip in the world ,  too . 
i highly recommend this grinder for flax seeds ,  no idea about coffee or other things ,  just flax seeds . 
this has changed my morning coffee routine forever . 
i particularly like to fact that the top is large and allows one to see what is happening inside . 
they do not really sanitize although you could probably put a couple drops of bleach in the water . 
i get many compliments on it as well . 
there is a circular ring at the bottom about and inch and a half wide that makes contact . 
i have many sets of dishes :  these are the ones i use . 
oh ,  last but certainly not least :  it is still quality made in the good old usofa . 
very disappointed in that but don t feel like going through the exchanging process . 
can be used for a lot of other things as well . 
this is critical for the jawbone to figure out what you are saying versus outside noise . 
i love how the orange rind comes of in spaghetti like strands . 
this is a lovely tool if your avocado falls within a a certain size . 
i use it every day that i am home . january num_num going strong !  !  !  . 
i ve used it on a num_num inch cake too and it worked well . 
there was a difference in the battery life ,  sometimes the bar would be short and sometimes substantially longer . 
using that adjustment may give you a little better fine tuning for the device . 
even though the phone was just over a year old ,  i figured the problem might be the battery . 
i love to get myself some fun tools . 
i just clean with dish washing liquid and a soft brush . 
it saves time and money !  who need starbucks ?  not me !  . 
if you have really long ear buds this might actually be a little too small . 
i d rate this oven as a good buy . 
mine has survived two falls and still looks pretty good . 
i really liked this product i got it because it was the easiest to use . 
it feels a little lose ,  but the price is great . 
in the past num_num to num_num years i went through three coffee grinders ,  two cuisinart and one bodum . 
 probably a good recommendation to enhance filter life anyway  . then there is clean up . 
i have acquired a nasty habit of doing that with my amazon purchases . 
i got that paper towel tip from another amazon reviewer . 
i would not purchase one of these in the future . 
nissan claims its a num_extend bottle but num_extend is over filling it . 
nothing is wrong with the first ,  he just wanted a backup . 
i picked this up several years ago in the kitchenetc store and absolutely love it . 
she and her husband have raved about them . 
i am now using it to make pots of green tea i can drink all day . 
my husband is a coffee drinker and i like iced coffee but it never tasted the same . 
i have owned my maverick digital candy thermometer for about num_num years . 
i expect that the case will perform well and as intended . 
if you are looking for a simple but effective juicer this is the one . 
helps keeping the mess to the minimun and holds a few utensils not just one like many others . 
my company provides coffee ,  but it really isn t the best . 
this model i ve been using for about num_num or num_num years . 
my pixi+ stays charged the entire day at work sitting on the dock when i m not using it . 
so far ,  this toaster seems more robust in design . 
one developed pitted marks after the first use . 
i wouldn t call it a steamvac though as it does not generate any steam or heat . 
with the cutting guide inside the keeper ,  it will help to avoid that . 
it does what its supposed to ,  but when i flip it ,  it leaks a little . 
we have to actually slice the bread and place a few slices on the side of the loaf . 
this product does what it is supposed to do . 
i absolutely loved this product so much that i am now buying them as gifts for everyone i know . 
my whole pack got wet and this case kept my phone dry . 
it s just the right size and i can just plop it in the dishwasher when it s dirty . 
this works very well to establish a bluetooth connection and has a convenient usb charging outlet as well . 
just lift up the pad and peel away the cookies . 
after apple launched the new iphone num_num i find out that it pull more energy . 
tested with a digital camera and a usb flash drive . 
i pray they make this product for the num_num soon !  . 
just make a few extra batches and freeze it for later . 
i still have these and also ordered another pack for when i need to replace the original three . 
wrap a coffee filter around bottom of the screen ,  and press . 
i only needed it for about num_num pairs . 
no cutting which is the biggest thing i like . 
it also holds a large dish of anything i want to serve . 
well you may so but its just a peeler how could ,  it be better then any other . 
i had mine for num_num years and it recently broke . 
you can get to the power switch and the headphone jack while the phone is in the case . 
my battery life drains pretty quickly ,  although normally i do make it through the day . 
this knife slices right through the hardest bread . 
this is actual jawbone earbuds and hook ,  not a cheap knock off . 
goodbye grungy baking sheets !  this mat is the best . 
i use it a couple of times a month and couldn t be happier with the performance . 
i purchased this one because it is an in between size . 
would recommend to anyone who is looking for a case . 
it s also made in malaysia . so ,  what do we have here ?  it s a very spacious ,  num_num ounce thermos . 
i wish this grill pan was larger but that would also make it heavier . 
the number of apps i have found are amazing .  .  . and best of all :  most are free . 
its correct size for straining tea and i like the shape of the strainer . 
the help of youtube how to videos is recommended !  . 
mine is arriving shortly and i will update this when i know if that makes a difference . 
my wife uses this little guy almost every day . 
just what we needed for our vacuum cleaner . 
this one was a lot shorter than that . 
i love the fact that you can turn off the roller to do the fringed rugs and floors . 
this may ,  in fact ,  turn out to be a dealbreaker for me . 
but ,  its exactly like all other automatic coffee makers i ve had . 
amazing brush ,  just like the oxo bottle brush !  . 
great screen protectors that go on well and provide that traction you need on your iphone for frequent use . 
the top has an indicator that tells you when you need to replace the filter . 
i ve gone through so many anodized aluminum pots and pans and teflon coated pots and pans ,  etc . 
it has performed extremely well in the car . 
i love otterbox covers but it is a pain to plug in the charging cable . 
this is not a case for a florida summer . 
this is my second set of wusthof grand prix . 
instructions tell you how many coals and how to place them to get various oven temps . 
i ve had my two num_num gallon vornados about num_num months and am very happy with them . 
the blender is new ,  so haven t used spares yet ,  but glad i got them !  yea for milkshakes !  . 
i should have just gotten the same one in the first place . 
it covered my screen and back perfectly  when applied correctly  . 
we are first time pressure cookers !  just received this and immediately put it to use making oxtail soup . 
the complete brew had a lot of body with robust flavor ,  like a great americano . b  one chemex filter . 
i only wish there was a way to take it apart to clean . 
i make it without the ice that is instructs you to put in . 
i bought these since my wife drops crumbs a lot which isn t great for a couch . 
these look much better in person than the picture suggests . 
works just as good if not better than ones that cost two or three time as much . 
i felt that it was a little difficult to understand the directions when putting the pieces together . 
i love it and would recommend to anyone that is wanting to bake for thanksgiving or christmas . 
i didn t think i needed another sized scoop ,  but boy was i wrong . 
unless you get something motorized this is as good as i can imagine . 
it is fantastic once you get past the assembly . 
we pretty much try for amazon prime shipping  which this had  . 
many of the bike harnesses were quite expensive and the cheap ones didn t look very secure . 
your first question is what other headsets am i comparing this to . 
it can do this as a result of its boxy num_extend
it protects the phone really well in the leather case . 
i also move it from my living room to my bedroom each night . 
this is a great looking coaster holder that really looks great in the house . 
it s slim ,  while providing maximum protection to the iphone . 
his phone does provide power and thumb drives mount no problem . 
i took a risk from jumping from the iphone num_extend to the evo . 
it s beautiful clean shine and shiny little dents add a lot of class for something so basic . 
it is very durable and surprisingly heavy duty for not being so heavy . 
i use this almost daily !  always make consistent ,  great popcorn . 
this did a great job of pulverizing our herbs . 
i used it as a small mixing bowl . 
delivery was a little slower than i anticipated but after contacting the seller ,  i understood the delay . 
the set width is just fine for my needs . 
so i bought a lanyard and i haven t lost a bt yet . 
will try with a cake and get back to you . 
it beeps when it has reached the appropriate temperature  heating or cooling  . 
for that reason alone ,  i opted for earbuds ,  for easy removal . 
buy a refill pack . also ,  pull down when removing . 
this is the best travel juicer for putting in your luggage to take on a plane . 
i need what i cook in to be washed . 
the ground coffee container is way too small . 
this is fine for egg whites but it is way too fast for powder things . 
i have light gray carpet throughout my house that is constantly getting dirty . 
my previous processor was a kitchenaid ,  and these problems didn t exist on it . 
item arrived quickly and packaged well ,  and the price was good . 
if you buy one piece ,  you ll definitely fall in love ,  and want to buy more . 
work fantastic flipping anything over such as chicken ,  meat .  .  . it is simply wonderful to have . 
would have given num_num standard but the description is not correct but the product works wonderfully . 
honestly ,  read the packets of your microwave popcorn . 
the pan is heavier than wilton cake pan and less expensive . 
this opener easily clamps on to the can . 
but starting out with warm water makes a big difference in how the dough rises . 
plugged it in to the mac book and tv and it was recognized immediately by both . 
it s not sticky like most rubber cases so it slides in and out of my pocket easily . 
so sold on this i have recommended it over and over to friends . 
this perfectly portable usb micro cord is num_num inches from end to end when fully extended . 
it came with the otterbox holster ,  but mine hooks on my belt and totally covers my phone . 
i wear mine everyday and almost all day . 
if you try to quickly jam the phone into place ,  yes .  . it becomes flimsy and unsecure . 
it s actually quite sturdy and while it s made to be used on a table top it s not tiny . 
also charges itself though a bit more slowly from indoor lighting . 
so now ,  i keep my storm easily recharged by inserting the phone into the pods when not in use . 
if you ve had an otterbox ,  it looks like the rest ,  you re sacrificing appearance and size for protection . 
much faster than the box grater it replaced and easier to handle as well . 
this is a well designed product which comes with multiple capabilities . 
this coffee grinder is an example of their commitment to quality . 
otherwise it boils water fast and we have had our since oct . 
it was just the right size for him . 
easy to use and has num_num size tops to fit more machines . 
this silicon gasket fits perfect in my fagor pressure cooker . 
great design while retaining the excellent cooking features of the earlier model . 
certainly a bit of an exaggeration ,  but compared to my shuns ,  that s pretty much the truth . 
when this pair eventually wares out ,  i ll probably look to acquire another . 
i got spray all over the baker and cooked it on . 
much better sound than this device but less than half the battery life . 
some coffee fans think it s the worst thing you can ever do to coffee . 
nice clean way to dress up cables both in the house and in the car . 
plus libbey is a good american made brand !  yay !  . 
this is my third num_extend and i love it . 
mishandling a device when connected ,  or worse ,  dropping it can snap it off completely . 
since i have a new wool carpet ,  the bissell brushes would get jammed with lint very quickly . 
i wish they had this in better colors as well . 
the num_extend set seems to be holding up fine . 
i got one hour and a half less after a year . 
bought it as a gift and parents love it . 
its pretty easy to install it just watch the vid num_extend
these are exactly what i needed and wanted . 
it easily outclasses anything in its price range ,  and matches machines costing num_num times as much . 
i could not understand why they stopped making it a couple years ago . 
the delivery was fast which i always appreciate . 
i like the smaller size since it is more kid friendly . 
i may consider buying an upgrade version if it is made with that said locking feature for hard cornering . 
follow the instructions and you won t have any problems . 
if you re looking for bose sound quality this probably isn t for you . 
i purchased this coffee maker to replace the one i d been using for the past five years . 
i love how colorful they are and use them almost daily . 
i assume it will stretch a bit with use which will make is easier to use . 
sweet !  my hand strength isn t the best ,  so this is a real boon to me . 
well the anti glare allows me to use it outside without the glare and with my dark sunglasses on . 
it fits perfectly . the best news ,  now half of camera shots aren t blurry ,  i can actually see the whole picture . 
the phase change occurs at a temperature below the freezing point of ice cream . 
i use it for one or two cups a day . 
i bought these to make the summer oatmeal recipe in and store over nite in the fridge . 
but it makes measuring cookies ,  meatballs ,  etc so much easier . 
we put the second one on the refrigerator next to the stove . 
if you have one of the small units you should not have any problems . 
makes a great gift and will go well with any kitchen . 
now if your looking for a midsized camp pot . 
it was cancelled by the seller as they ran out of stock . 
wmf profi plus gadgets are all made very well and they are strong and durable . 
pour as much mangria as you like ,  then top with a splash of  good  orange juice .  .  . happy times ensue  :   . 
the lemoncello is still steeping away ,  so the size and shap are perfect for those needs . 
it is so comfortable you would forget you are wearing it . 
i have never had a problem when the one i had in the past or with this unit . 
just that oils  oxidize  in the open air . 
you simply tap the large easy to find and handle jog dial with your left hand . 
sure wish more pans were this sturdy !  ! highly recommend !  !  !  . 
expensive ,  yes ,  but i d gladly spend the money again for another . 
this of course ,  can be dependent on your network . 
now there s more room in my utensil drawer . 
if you must have fresh squeezed ,  then this is the tool . 
but it does the job for a crowd . 
these function really well ,  fit great ,  last for a good period of time without charging . 
my only gripe with this item is the plastic knob on the top of the lid . 
clean up is a breeze if i do not let the potato dry on the ricer . 
the phone has been dropped a couple times and remained safe . 
meanwhile ,  num_num stars for good appearance ,  price and free delivery . 
it has performed fabulously for my husband and me . 
don t use really course coffee ,  the water will shoot out of the pot . 
because of those comment ,  i tend to handle my steam containers carefully . 
no major deal killer ,  but it is rather light . 
one star is given for the first month while this battery was working normally . 
i got this in chrome ,  and it holds all of my oversized coffee mugs perfectly fine . 
it comes with num_num small labels to avoid leaving finger prints . 
i noticed that the knob was not fully set at cappuccino . 
it does not do a quick charge but it keeps them running . 
my husband broke the tip off of the one i had . 
i purchased these graduated cutters sometime ago and i must say they get quite a work out . 
i have a belkin on my phone and own several others . 
the case fit perfectly on my phone with no problems . 
i just can t say enough good things about it . 
this is a great little pot with tons of versatility and durability . 
this scaler makes quick work of any fish . 
drained the battery until the iphone shuts off automatically  by playing music ,  videos ,  games ,  making phone calls ,  num_extend
i can have this entire unit cleaned ,  dried and put back together in a matter of a couple minutes . 
the price was the best that i found on line . 
i needed a second knife bar to hold the rest of my knife set and this one is perfect !  . 
they put up to a lot of abuse ,  and honestly ,  i recommend them to all my friends . 
she told me several of her friends have ruined their phones by dumping them in the toilet . 
if you don t intend to move the diffuser around ,  go with the flame tamer . 
and hope not to test it on such . 
my first one got broken due to some significant abuse by my toddler . 
its big ,  its not waterproof ,  but its the best for what it does ,  and thats protecting your iphone . 
i also add jollytime butter seasoning to the oil before i start cooking . 
we use it frequently and it has held up admirably . 
i cut it down for an iphone ,  and it works perfectly with the iphone . 
an easy solution ,  both for church volunteers staffing the reception and ourselves . 
i have put in very hot liquids and so far no problem . 
you do have to remove the case to maximize sound increase though . 
besides it has a nice look and feel . 
even though it is just me ,  the cooker is not too big for most jobs . 
thephonedevil magicscreen :  crystal clear edition is by far the best at a most reasonable price . 
it s taking me a while to get the hang of it ,  but ,  it is very well made . 
we prefer this smaller sized tank because it is not so heavy to lift and fill . 
thanks ,  amazon for having this great feature . so i cleaned it out ,  put it in the freezer to chill it . 
i have purchased others ,  and followed the directions and still end up with lint underneath . 
this works really well ,  fits a jelly roll pan easily . 
very helpful for freeing up space in my tiny bedroom . 
generally ,  i only do one or two ,  but i ve also juiced more than num_num during one session . 
now i have used it probably on an average of twice a day for that num_num years . 
looks like it could come part at the seems ,  but so far it s held up without any problems . 
the silpat baking sheet is a great little tool for bakers to have on hand . 
bar keepers friend keeps it nice and new looking . 
this case rocks for what it really is .  .  . a simple clean well fitting protective case . 
the thing is its imposible to take off . 
i love these containers ,  i use them to pack all of my left overs and they work great . 
if they made the soup spoon about % bigger ,  than i d have given these num_num stars . 
the patterns are no longer logical but random and it will turn itself on and off . 
much better taste but we do need to filter it with a screen to keep out too many grounds . 
it is very affordable ,  and puts a good edge on my kitchen knives . 
also ordered the square version and will probably order more as they are difficult to find . 
no assembly whatsoever ,  i imagine this is how they use to build fans in the num_extend and num_extend
not too had to apply and good value . 
i own a jabra speaker for my car and it is the best one i own . 
so what to do ?  buy this case and problem solved . 
this machine is everything i was looking for . 
excellent steel and holds its edge very well . 
i got this for my daughter ,  who loves the weight and the balance . 
it charged my samsung galaxy note faster than the usb wall charger that came along with the phone . 
looks like they know what they are doing . 
it pulled up an amazing amout of fur ,  etc . 
i have not used the pan yet ,  but it appears of excellent quality . 
some sort of heavier lid material would be nice . 
this is a good price and a nice unit . 
i brought this phone cover for my wife . 
the water must be hot so that it does not crack the iron . 
it is the solid state transformer inside which makes these chargers durable . 
in fact i bought the first one for the cup ,  a great travel mug . 
so your phone is actually getting double protection . 
this is a great tool for roasting in the oven ,  especially for poultry or pork . 
to begin ,  i have never had a bluetooth before . 
we have the bowls ,  cups ,  and plates from ikea and love them all . 
i haven t been this excited about a kitchen tool in a long time . 
however ,  we tend to use the wider roll much more ,  even for relatively small fills . 
i really like the fact that it uses a standardmicro usb cable instead of the iphone connector . 
it all looks the same in the drawer . 
can store for the winter or when not in use protecting it from the weather . 
this little machine does the job quickly and easily for me . 
i landed on this one !  and then it came in the mail . 
also perfect with broccoli added on top of the rice in the last num_num minutes . 
it s been only two weeks ,  but seem to last as long as original battery ,  about a day . 
this is my fourth attempt at a screen protector for my iphone . 
good !  i don t want a protective case that fits loosely and then pops off when the iphone is dropped . 
works very well on my carpet especially when used with the hoover deep cleansing shampoo . 
but so far ,  it works as advertised and is keeping its shine . 
if you re straining stock or broth ,  this is a real time saver . 
i never realized how dull they were until i sharpened them all . 
i previously purchased the laza zcell which has a similar battery and back door . 
one of the best purchases i ve made in a while . 
looking forward to creating more delicious desserts with my kitchenaid mixer . 
we used to to make dough for my husband s strawberry glazed pie as well as to shred strawberries . 
it weighs about a pound or a little more . 
it s heat tolerant  doesn t melt on the edge  . 
i swore by them and told everyone to get one  or two  . 
use the cooker at least once a week . 
both our boys know how to use this on their own and it offers a great consistent cooking service . 
non stick coating can be seen on the ware and the handle is quite solid . 
the stand is well made and designed ,  strong materials and it looks just like an apple computer monitor stand . 
it came a couple of days before my phone came and it does its job well . 
bought it for a friend to activate her new phone . 
if you make chocolates you must buy these tools . 
i work from home sometimes and use the speakerphone for conference calls . 
i love ,  love ,  love this skillet and i would say i use it several times in a day . 
does what it needs to do ,  efficient and inexpensive . 
la camara full hd lo recomiendo al %
it takes very little space in the fridge and holds enough for us . 
i replaced mine with some hose from the local hardware store and it s worked great ever since . 
has simple to connect power and ground connections . 
the new battery holds a charge better than the original that came with my phone . 
the matte is more of a powdercoat finish than a textured plastic feel . 
it just starts immediately mixing and kneading ,  then adds the yeast . 
i don t have it anymore but it protected it while i had it . 
not very expensive and fits well in my kitchen with the rest of the oxo products i have . 
use a razor to remove the remains ,  and used contact cement to glue the unit to dash . 
always does a good job of popping corn . 
we are a family of num_num and it is still quite large . 
i don t have a lot of counter space ,  so was looking for an alternative to a knife block . 
at first glance ,  this seems like the perfect all in one pen device . 
i always measure out what i am grinding and grind it all through . 
still a great product though and i would order again . 
i prefer the normal but use the quick when running short of time . 
this toothbrush holder will not fall down off the wall . 
based on the dimensions ,  this would be num_num cups not num_extend
the procedure went exactly as described and now i have what the phone should have been delivered with . 
the only downfall is that it doesn t protect the front and very minimum top and bottom protection . 
when i saw that ,  it turned me around . 
i thought about getting this for a while ,  probably a couple years . 
i have to use my nine inch pans for that . 
this extra battery has saved me numerous times since i purchased it . 
this range top can easily and quickly heat oil to num_num degrees for deep frying . 
i use them for birthdays ,  holidays ,  and whenever i bake cakes or need whipped cream for toppings . 
on my num_extend filter now for the culligan faucet mounted water filter i purchased over num_num years ago . 
i have several sizes ,  but this is the one i use the most . 
i knew i didn t want one of those super duper high end grinders that cost $
get it if you don t care too much about aesthetics . 
i was ready to put it in the garbage . 
the main thing is that it gets me through the day . 
this is my first otterbox case i ever used . 
this freed up a ton of space in the cabinet for oils and bottles . 
i haven t had any problems with this ice cube tray . 
the hook is easy to switch around so that it goes on the left num_extend
as i unpacked mine five years ago ,  i found no signs that it had ever been used before . 
great size for the home ,  lite weight and they rinse off like a champ and cleanup great also . 
it s just different ,  that s all  and gives it a very clean outside appearance ,  which i really like  . 
cocktails originally were served in small and elegant glasses ,  strong and intense and using the best ingredients . 
hence ,  i wanted one with a thermal carafe . 
  i am the only one who drinks coffee at my house  . 
i have charged it up but not yet used it . 
i purchased this vacuum to replace another small eureka canister vacuum that finally quit working after num_num years . 
theres nothing bad i can ever say about any otterbox products . 
the cord is short ,  as others have mentioned ,  but an extension cord is an easy fix . 
for now ,  i am enjoying the even heating and the superslick non stick interior . 
right under the area where the styrofoam was busted up ,  the machine was dented in several places . 
i ll be patient .   and easy to clean ,  so i m very satisfied . 
i definitely recommend this to all my friends !  . 
nevertheless ,  the arctic sound have surprisingly good sound over low ,  mid ,  and high frequency ranges . 
the first thing that it does well is provide much needed length in the cable . 
the noise is minimal and it really does make a difference . 
one of the best purchases i ve made this year . 
so far i am impressed with it s quality . 
well ,  how did i get along without them . 
for the majority of tasks ,  this is completely irrelevant . 
i have found few uses for bags this small . 
would have been nice if they had explained in their instruction book . 
and one day ,  a huge bubble appeared under the screen disabling the touch screen . 
because this is just a piece of plastic ,  i just trimmed it to fit perfectly . 
i purchased these spice jars about a year ago for bulk spices . 
people on the other end also say i come through as if i m sitting next to them talking . 
i am prepping for thanksgiving dinner and after one use of this food processor i am hooked . 
the memory card slot is on the left side of the white sim card . 
i ve paired this unit with my samsung galaxy s mobile phone ,  and the two function together seamlessly . 
i was so excited to get this ,  but it stopped working after only a couple minutes use . 
i used a papertowel to try a test cut before sharpening . 
i like this :  the size and the shape . 
i imagine it would probably be great for making sticky candies or rolling other doughs as well . 
if and when the stainless steel grinding mechanism dulls  which will happen  ,  it s landfill time . 
i wish it was more agile to get under or around tight spaces . 
nothing sticks to them ,  and the clean up is a breeze . i liked it so much i ordered more . 
as with stainless lined dishwashers ,  i would never use dishwasher soap that contains lemon . 
i have used it for canning chicken ,  beef ,  venison ,  turkey stocks; jams; pumpkin and other fruits and vegetables . 
it works on all my knives ,  even hollow edge . 
i love fresh salsa but i hate chopping tomatoes and onions to put in it . 
but this num_num oz beast delivers a few extra ounces of coffee heaven to my commute . 
i make a cheese omelet in it for myself and it just glides .  .  .  .  .  . no sticking issues ,  even with the cheese . 
that s because i melted the first one by keeping it in an num_num watt microwave for over four minutes . 
it still works great and am even still using the original headset . 
he is very happy with the case combined with this armorsuit militaryshield screen protector . 
i m hoping it will last longer but we ll see . 
by lunch time the rice is still warm . at first i questioned if mr . 
i d never owned any inserts; so those were a bonus . 
plugs in ,  lights up red when drawing juice . 
love the colors and lasted longer than the knock offs as expected . 
i also especially like the small powered brush that you can use for stairs . 
also ,  i actually find the griddle quite useful . 
i had always wanted a set of stainless steel canisters . 
the design is far as safety is fool proof . 
so i purchased extras to keep in each car . 
i bought this humidifier specifically for white noise and it does not disappoint . 
the num_extend always had drop offs unless i had my iphone on my arm or in my hand . 
if you need a set of these this is a good one . 
this is a really heavy ,  good quality pie pan . 
if you are looking to extend your battery for this phone this is a must . 
for the price ,  i think this is the best value out there . 
i bought my new unlocked  cingular branded  treo online . 
this is a larger gap than my other num_num larger scoops of the same type . 
it s very quick ,  and definitely good enough to protect food from freezer burn for several weeks . 
the iphone is a teeny bit ivory compared to the almost bluish white of the otter cover . 
i probably will order another color at a later date . 
not being waterproof is not that much of a concern for me . 
this unit is worth every cent ,  my wife uses it constantly no complaints . 
so glad i spent the extra few bucks for this item . 
while true my household we don t really care about that . 
i really like this and it attaches so easy and is easy to use and clean . 
it s much larger then i had imagined and it is the . 
i bought this to use with my chemex . 
it also does not have any ff or rew buttons . 
consistent results everytime once you get the hang of adjusting it . 
these are very good quality and should last for sometime . 
bonus ,  it s by far the most attractive garlic press we ve seen . 
i put hot water in the empty pot and push the plunger up and down a few times . 
these are not only large but extra large .  .  .  . just make sure that is what your looking for . 
i purchased this as a replacement battery for a motorola num_extend
these pans are the perfect size for my toaster oven . 
i ll try it for cake next time i bake one . 
the hard silicone   ?   is nice to the tough ,  and gives me a little better grip on my phone . 
i owned a pair of cheap cookie sheets that were quite flimsy and starting to warp . 
it is the lightest best gripping knife i ever held . 
this system is not fancy ,  but it works . 
i uploaded a photo to the customer images section . 
they are sprayed with mixture of soy oils and baked for num_num minutes at num_num degrees f . 
it didn t even foam . what i really like about the hoover is the ease of use . 
it also does a fine job on quesadillas ,  or so my son tells me . 
i keep it on my kitchen island where it s always handy . 
like all new knives ,  this one was very sharp and cut right through crusty bread with ease . 
cast iron cookware works well ,  and works for the long run . 
i like the blue light indicator of remaining charge ,  very clean looking . 
i will be buying num_num more to max out the capacity of this dryer . 
plan on making a lot of pottery decorations with this product . 
as a matter of fact ,  i just order another for my iphone . 
like one of them had a braun that lasted me over num_num years and the mr . 
we put cast iron pizza pan on a weber kettle grill and let it get hot with burning coal . 
it does not take much to figure out how it works . 
then i have a small glass of wine and reinstall the bottle stopper and draw a vacuum again . 
leaves the carpet clean and not too damp , this is the one to have for convenience and cost !  . 
physically ,  the stylus looks a lot like a ball pen body . 
it s been three months and i ve only charged it once . 
bought this for general use ,  works like a charm . 
it filled the bill nicely and i would recommend this caddy to anyone . thank you !  . 
num_extend read the manual and do the maintenance it suggests . 
i think for the price they are good . 
i am delighted with this machine ,  and have no need to keep up with the development of newer coffeemakers . 
first of all ,  my subtraction of a star doesn t indicate disdain for the product . 
this isn t so much so though when the rack is on . 
it s so pretty and brightly colored and i love all the butterflies . 
i remember about num_num years ago upgrading from some nokia phone to the nokia num_extend
perfect for a small under cabinet drawer system . 
i could no longer use pam or any other spray oil ,  because of the propellant used in them . 
the extra battery life is so great that i cannot imagine using the iphone without it . 
and the gauge also fogs up on me pretty bad . 
but for the money ,  i would suggest a speck candyshell . 
this machine is a top of the line machine . 
this is so much more convient and easy now . 
note :   continental size silverware is traditionally popular in european countries . 
last year i started a new job where i had to be outdoors all the time . 
i do like it and keep it at my vacation house where i only have a drip machine . 
even comes with a clip for my ipod . 
it was way cheaper than the store ones and worked just as well . 
just looking at the photos does not let you know just how well its built . 
usually num_num per week in the summer months and num_num per week in the winter months . 
i would recommend this to anyone ,  especially those over the age of num_extend
get the little attachment so you can loop it over your ear . 
the cheese cakes i have made in it have not leaked and cooked evenly . 
keeps my bluetooth ear piece safe and protected . 
it does this very well ,  and easily washed  by hand  . 
they make working with baking components so much easier . 
thankfully ,  my problem was fixable and i could care less about rooting now . 
the blades are super sharp which makes the peeling very easy . 
this had the most glowing reviews so i ordered it and she loves it . 
our days of standing in line for pancakes from a skillet are over . 
i have worked over my henckel s so many times i ve exhausted myself . 
run it every day and it ll keep things pretty clean . 
update july num_num num_extend brother still has his norpro num_num quart num_extend inch deep  and loves it . 
some vents use the clamps in one direction and some in the other . 
this pot comes with simple ,  easy to understand directions . 
but i borrowed it from my neighbor and its great . 
at any rate ,  adding the weight i was able to pull up even more water than that . 
i meant a cord charger for samsung num_extend this charger is for the num_extend
i covered it in oil and kept doing that for num_num days . 
it s great for the price and works excellent . 
if i m on a call already it transfers to the device quickly . 
probably like most people i have had indoor grillers before . 
i ve used it a couple times and have these num_extend
i m testing it so many times still same problem happen . 
when i ordered this ,  i thought there would be a screen protector for the back but there wasn t . 
i ve used this only once to sharpen all my knives and they are sharp . 
it is so simple and the oven still looks like new . 
some fans have really huge openings in the front screen and can be a much bigger hazzard . 
it will make your loaves really look professional out of the oven . 
but it takes microsd up to num_num num_extend
i bought this rotisserie to replace one just like it that i finally wore out . 
i purchased this pan to replace an identical one that i lost in a move . 
there is no  top ; it s the same on both sides ,  which is exactly what we wanted . 
it is as shown except it is huge . 
properly preheating your pan and warming up your food will reduce stickiness by a whole lot . 
it s hard to find the larger ones ,  especially thick and sturdy like this . 
fits in the spare compartment to keep my phone charged while i m riding . 
it s weight makes it comfortable to use and the stainless steel makes it easy to clean . 
the ear hook can become uncomfortable after an hour or so of wear . 
baked bread and got a nice crunchy crust . 
i loved it so much a bought a calphalon sauce pan . 
one of my chef knives is used just about on a daily basis . 
i haven t tried the silicone version so i don t know if an upgrade is called for . 
hot pink and any other shade of pink is just not what s popping anymore . 
the cruiser announces the frequency and you can set your radio to it . 
many excellent reviews ,  so i went for it . 
i got the evo num_extend a month after it came out . 
this charging cord uses an extra two prongs so that it can recharge the phone quicker . 
this is definitely the sturdiest ,  sharpest bread knife i ve ever owned . 
i bought this case for my iphone num_extend and this case looks really good on the wight iphone num_extend
if you want a smooth ,  rich cup ,  this is really the only way . 
i highly recommend this if you want a small ,  reasonably priced portable battery . 
the pan is easy to clean ,  the bread comes out level and properly baked . 
the bacon comes out done more evenly due to the relatively small footprint . 
i gave that one away to the church for their rummage sale . 
it will smoke when you try to grill on it the first num_num x or so . 
when we got them her set seemed to be a nice package with everything included . 
for whatever reason ,  the super tooth enhances the volume and pick up pattern of your voice into the iphone . 
this is the perfect stew pot to cook a large dinner with . 
i bought this because a good friend who was visiting put my num_extend yr old skillet in the dishwasher . 
this works great and makes water taste very clean and crisp . 
it s still working great and still doing what it s supposed to do . 
i need a fan to sleep by .  .  . the white noise is perfect . 
i often woke up with an irritated throat and nose and knew it was from the poor air quality . 
fun project that makes lots and lots of cheese . 
this is a very basic ,  high quality pressure cooker . 
even many hours later ,  my food was still hot enough to be enjoyable . 
when we were more gentle with our closings ,  the problem stopped . 
i ended up finding my old charger but i think this one is actually better . 
the size is perfect for their microwave to catch the drippings . 
overall ,  i highly recommend this product if you like your lettuce clean and fresh !  . 
they lost it in the shipping process and promptly refunded me . 
i use this dispenser to divvy up seed for my parrot . 
this is the fourth hot shot we have owned . 
it also provides a very secure grip when handling your phone . 
it worked beautifully and with absolutely no problems . 
i went with lodge ,  because i own two of their dutch ovens ,  which i love . 
and they re comfortable to use despite my large hands . 
the product is accurately described by the seller . 
everything ,  even bacon grease ,  rolls right off of them with a light wash . 
this one has the best of both worlds . 
but it is so lightweight and small and you can use it just about everywhere . 
the handle is comfortable and a good grip ,  doesnt slip when wet or your hands are geasy . 
this comes with a cleaning brush and an injection tip . 
these bowls are really nice for the price . 
the rubber shell is very easy to install . 
if you ever had a belkin product ,  you are familiar with their quality . 
bought it because alton brown used it on his show . 
the cast iron is very flat and the pan retains and distributes heat very evenly . 
the drawback for me is that i tend to break vac pots due to most of them being glass . 
i don t like the taste of coffee that has been kept on a burner or num_extend
i enjoy slicing ,  dicing and chopping with the globals except . 
this mixer whip is the perfect little gadget . 
seems well made and should do the job for which it is intended . 
at $ the nordic ware cake lifter is comparably priced to the smaller ,  lighter ,  wilton cake $
so far i have had no problems with this product at all . 
the handle appears to have been attached by an adhesive that degraded over time . 
i intend to use this pan only for baking ,  never for pizzas ,  and it has never disappointed . 
easy to set up ,  and works after charging the bluetooth for two hours pryor to using . 
they are remarkably sturdy for having no middle support ,  and can take a good amount of weight . 
the coffee stays hot for hours and hours . 
it s not perfect ,  but it s definitely very good . 
if you love coffee ,  never fry it with a hot plate ! the coffee comes out pretty darn hot as well . 
this size works for giving as gifts or when you want to make different flavors . 
its not a super fast juicer but works great . 
i purchased this because my boyfriend is a typical man and can t slice cheese for the life of him . 
haven t had a chance to use it yet ,  but i m going to find a reason . 
it isn t a quick charger which can only be the down side . 
works well to heat water for ramen and whatever other snack and drink requires hot water . 
i just keep an extra battery charged up and i switch the two batteries daily . 
i also love that it can fit about any size of jar . 
odor control is great too with the carbon wrap installed on the filter . 
i love this peeler so much that i m giving my family these to try also . 
i got this waffler after the cuisinart round waffler bailed on me . 
i have not used the flash though . oh ,  and also you got to love the price . 
great price ,  fast shipping ,  product arrived in perfect condition . 
if you have a big chunk left ,  take it out for christs sake . 
the eforcity case often took off the back panel along with it; this doesn t have that problem . 
it takes longer to knead than my ctc too . but .  .  . it makes the best pasta i have ever tried . 
screen is very bright and readable in direct num_extend
i just dial from my phone ,  and then hit the hang up button when done . 
the knob does come off if you pull on it instead of twisting it . 
it goes from percalator grind whis is coarse to an extra fine grind for expresso . 
i gave this four stars because oxo customer service is one of the best . 
i have a friend who uses this fan for white noise in his bedroom . 
significantly different than the feel and operation of other can openers i ve owned . 
my mixer came with the funky tin looking one that turns color if you put in dishwasher . 
we have discovered that we prefer using the side that produces slightly thicker shreds of cheese . 
i have theplantronics  . audio num_num num_extend pc gaming headsetwith the latter being my  standard  headset . 
came to late for the holidays but it looks like it will work great ,  good quality also . 
i m very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone looking for a quality baking sheet . 
we have used our panini grill a couple times a week since acquisition ,  with great results . 
this is a good pan for mini tarts . 
they can rest on the edge of a hot pot without harm . 
it does not work well with the wilton disposable pastry bags . 
my son keeps his i phone in the case at all times . 
the biggest thing i was looking for was comfort . 
this was one of the first pieces of lodge cast iron that i ordered . 
if you make a quiche ,  for example ,  and it leaks or overflows ,  be very careful how you clean it . 
i use it to also charge my kindle fire . 
i plan to buy two more and put my wustfoff away for when company comes . 
it s a little pricy ,  but it s a cuisinart; so you know it will last forever . 
i bought this to replace the soft silicone skin type cover on num_extend phone . 
i think i have become a true fan of this rather than tins which aren t as secure . 
it s heavy and i keep it in my lower oven when not using . 
i liked it but a part got down the garbage disposal and broke . 
this is contructed from heavy aluminum and holds up well to use and also heats evenly . 
you put cake mix in it and make cake . 
you can also adjust the volume by moving your finger along the length of the earpiece . 
i love the shape and size of these wineglasses . 
i have had it since num_num and it has not burned out yet . 
after years of just absolutely hating shredding cheese with cheap box graters ,  i decided to finally upgrade to microplane . 
i have had this waffel maker for about num_num months . 
the laser pointer and flashlight are an added bonus that have come in use for presentations at work . 
the motors are not powerful to chop through heavy amounts ice and frozen fruit . 
it sharpens well with my chefs choice electric sharpener . 
the knife arrived razor sharp and slices everything with ease . 
the grip is comfortable ,  the peeling action is smooth and quick and it just is a joy to use . 
or maybe even a couple of lifetimes ,  when your grandkids inherit it . 
not only did they love it ,  they couldn t stop talking about it . 
this scoop is exactly the right size for uniform cookies every time . 
after it is running you can take the lid off to add things . 
i bought num_num of these for my num_num pound pekingese . 
this is seriously pretty easy to do ,  you just can t rush it . 
these high output chargers will charge most devices much faster than the charger you get with a device . 
one of mine is now more than two years old and works just fine . 
if you do not have the fga ,  then you cannot use the fvsp . 
my recommendation however is to dump the landline and save the money . 
she says that it doesn t slide easily inside her pocket . your iphone is made with glass . 
two reviews mention it running in excess of num_num watts . 
it definately works and is simple to use . 
i put my olive oil in pump and spray . 
i really enjoy baking ,  and i enjoy doing a lot of things myself by hand . 
i do prefer the thinner version ,  but the thicker versions aren t so bad either . 
the ten speed settings are a plus ,  thought find i stick with my usual speed . 
it s does a great job with no clogs or anything . 
the ends have a useful bend to them that makes picking up food items easy . 
i like the clear top  ,  i might just buy a bigger one too . 
i have a droid num_num with a case on it ,  and it doesn t quite fit exactly . 
it dims the clock and makes for a wonderful bedside clock and alarm clock . 
the angled offset keeps my knuckles out of the frosting . 
the otter is not waterproof and the ear ,  camera and speakers are fully open . 
would recommend this for the value even though this is bigger  think two iphones stacked on each other  . 
for all the other reviews about the lids not being tight enough ,  they apparently have fixed this problem . 
we have had the type that has a chemical inside it ,  making scooping quicker . 
i needed a two cup and the price was amazing !  i m very glad to have it . 
like me ,  you may not like the included travel mug . 
i love that it isn t necessary to open the oven to get a reading on the doneness of food . 
the charging dock makes the note num_num very appealing . 
however ,  it is what it is .  .  . exactly as it appears in on the amazon site . 
the inside antenna is really designed to sit on the corner of your desk . 
this pasta is too delicate and cooks too fast for that method . 
i wash all parts by hand ,  i just do . 
the only shortcoming i could dream of is the shape and space used in the drawer . 
the grippy sides really helped holding this larger device and she loves that most . 
just grab the old filter and pull it out . 
we wanted a rack that was horizontal ,  not vertical to add to the strength . 
i use for cooking small amounts of pasta ,  gravies ,  heating milk for cheese and yogurt ,  water for tea ,  etc . 
the casing itself feels great in my hands compared to the rough and edgy verizon model . 
perfect for people who cook for themselves only ,  or for a few people . 
 if you like that layer ,  keep your cheap cooker !   it s really foolproof . 
of course ,  it can cut through a lot of other things ,  too . 
i love this knife !  so happy purchasing it . 
these are well made and quite heavy ,  easy to use . 
however ,  they are not cheap for what looks like num_num cents wrth of plastic . 
i was a little concerned whether they d fit in my dishwasher ,  but there was no problem . 
i bought a second one for the other car . 
these are great sizes !  they range from num_num cup to num_num cups . 
gave as a gift and the recipient has been very pleased . 
it fit s snugly in the car s power outlet and in the iphone . 
it looks great feels just right in my hand . 
we use it almost exclusively ,  but i especially love using it with our copper bowl for whipping up cream . 
bought these for a new apartment ,  and they have been performing excellent . 
i just received the car mount and i m very happy with design . 
i have had the square canister for a number of years ,  in fact i now have two of them . 
pans turn blacker and smoother with lard than any other fat known to man ,  including bacon fat . 
works just like the one i got with my num_extend
my product came with four different sieves allowing for four differing sizes of cut . 
cakes made with this pan are evenly browned at the sides and bottom . 
i wasn t looking for brown but still decided to get this . 
i thought i d try one more popper before settling . 
i like the fact that the case can be used as a handle . 
the outside is polished so it s easy to clean it and it looks pretty good . 
they are not fragile and yet they are very pretty . 
we use ours all the time . the following review is out of date . 
i liked that this is portable and can attach to the headphone jack of a phone or ipad . 
i have found butter to be better than oil for keeping the pan seasoned . 
i have bough two of the hd models and recently purchased the legend . 
the rubber feet keep it from sliding around while i grate into a bowl or onto a plate . 
i think this mixes and kneads the dough more thoroughly than the oster did . 
i think i paid about the same price to have it professionally cleaned . 
so yeah ,  the packaging was amazing . con : the hose attachment storage is weird . 
it delivers more pepper in one turn than our previous mill did in num_num turns . 
i had lots of extra blades and attachments etc . 
i am impressed with the quality of this set . 
i would plug it in ,  turn it to high ,  and be ready to cook within num_num minutes . 
when people visit ,  i brew a decaf and caffeinated coffee . coffee will overflow making a horrible mess if you : a . 
and finally ,  the voice prompts on the unit . 
i hold a towel in front of the popper ,  not a big deal . 
i gave this a num_num because the problem is not with the blue tooth it s self . 
it is longer than others i have seen and works beautifully . 
these are made for dirt devil and work great . 
they want a very high price for there battery . 
i had just never realized by how much . 
my hands are very week and the other kind hurts my hand . 
first ,  it does make good coffee ,  and it makes hot coffee ,  which is great if you add cream . 
kitchen aid changed their model and didn t make replacement parts . 
excellent charger for the car ,  arrived in perfect condition . 
to roast a pork roast or chicken ,  you use the spit . 
i really wanted to get something simple to experiment with grinding my own meat at home . 
i also like to use them at work and can pair with my pc or phone via bluetooth . 
and a switch on the side for choosing between num_num vac and usb . 
i also couldn t get the protective cover to stay on the screen . 
used this pan for the first time last weekend ,  and the results were awesome . 
i couldn t get it to work at all at first . 
this will not replace your vacuum cleaner ,  but serves as a quick easy clean up machine for small messes . 
as for whether you spill it while you re drinking ,  nobody can account for how one person drinks . 
not real wild about either ,  but they work . 
dishwasher safe ,  oven safe ,  freezer safe and microwave safe . 
a great size for cutting fruit or small pieces of meat . 
steady noise is eliminated but music and voices still cause interference . 
this one comes in handy and very easy to use and clean . 
i wanted to make foamy coffee drinks at home so i decided to order this one . 
you can leave it there if your not going to use a filter . 
it is very blingy !  she will love it . 
the welds are inconsistent ,  with some being very even and some not . 
this pan rusted for me after just num_num years in the corners and bottom holes . 
these seem great ,  durable and of good quality . 
i see now they have a couple of other models with more options and i m thinking of upgrading . 
charged the phone fast and still showed almost a full charge on the back up . 
our only bummer is someone threw away num_num spoons and that had nothing to do with henckels . 
for food prep from making bread dough to grating parmesan cheese ,  it s such a time saver . 
i own a few other oxo products that have lasted for years . 
it arrived in perfect condition  it was very well packed  and the legs attached easily . 
my grandmother uses mine whenever she gets the chance ,  because it s familiar to her . 
i used to dread having my phone slip out of my hand ,  now i don t . 
that was terrific for cooking pea soup and other foods that tend to scorch easily . 
being steel; oils will not form a permanent film on them like you see with plastic . 
jack connection on bottom is small as well . 
i have owned my original farberware set since the num_extend and they still are amazing cookware pieces . 
done !  just had to pat dry and wrap in plastic film ! it was delicious on our homemade pizza !  . 
the grantwood case is more expensive but does not have any of these problems . 
buy two now so you don t have to come back and order another one like i am doing now . 
but anyways its a great item to a num_num user . 
i am terrible at putting these things on my phone . 
i ve not found an oxo product i dislike yet . 
a little more might make cappucino  sic ?   grinds ,  but i m not that exotic . 
but this num_extend really reduces the background noise considerably . 
who knew ?  ! the keypad does lock and the screen goes dark rather quickly . 
fagor makes fine pressure cookers ,  and this is no exception . 
first time i ve ever used one of these . 
this also happened with another otg cable for my motorola droid num_extend
the last one cost us about $ and lasted almost a year . 
i love this system but i am on my third belt clip . 
i bought these bowls ,  dinner plates ,  and saucers last month and am very happy i did . 
that one works well ,  but installation was a lot of work . 
i bought these speaker stands for $ including shipping . 
my only beef ?  i wish that it didn t shrink a little . 
i saw this one for $ on amazon and nabbed it not really expecting great results . 
all the buttons are accessible and fits good for samsung focus . 
these have held up well ,  sound good and work with iphones and blackberries . 
it fits perfectly and the zebra print is pretty . 
i had some problem with a small rack near a sink ,  in a bathroom . 
although i have purchased two other knives ,  i needed another one like this one . 
the rubber shell also takes a few minutes to attach and get all of the rubber edges aligned . 
i have enjoyed my mixer experimenting with different speeds and attachments for different products . 
i used these to protect my phone s screen and they did a great job . 
i don t need an expensive case but just one that will do the job . 
when i use my bose headset ,  i listen to music from anywhere of num_num to num_num hours a day . 
it charges at home ,  in the car ,  wherever ,  and is ready when your device needs the boost . 
it would be nice if it could handle heavier foods but we love it anyway . 
this  old fashionned  looking vac does a far better job than the new ones with plastic receptacles  i . e .  ,   bagless   . 
i am really pleased with the new canner . 
this dispenser works great  and i have num_num other styles as well  . 
these work so well and clean up easily . 
i see nothing that would indicate this is low quality stainless steel . 
you can make soup in it and ice cream in it . 
the processor is more than capable of pureeing or liquefying . 
this case has such a nice cushion it has saved me many times over . 
it is used over two num_extend burners with two perforated simmer diffusers sandwiched between . 
i takes me less than half the time to make cucumber salad and the results are beautiful . 
i mainly got it for emergencies and it serves its purpose but would recommend a better quality one . 
on normal metal racks ,  it tends to just get glued on . so ,  i think this  cooling grid  is just superior . 
i also purchased the num_num sided version of the sponge holder ,  made by the same manufacturer . 
easy to open and easy to close with the blade inside a quality product at a reasonable price . 
popping in the nordic ware is much more healthy too . 
have been using this for a week and learning what works and what doesn t . 
i really needed a new paring knife and shopped around for quite a while before i decided on these . 
keeps phone slim .  .  .  . and my phone always drops on its side .  .  .  . so no need for back protection . 
the call quality is really good on both ends . 
i wish it would charge a bit faster ,  but for the capacity there really is nothing better right now . 
it is quite sturdy ,  and a great improvement over the flimsy aluminum one our parents had . 
if you don t plan to access the battery or sd card ,  then this is not an issue . 
i d like the loaf pan to come with a lid as well . 
this may be different if you choose to but the full aluminum version . 
hmmm i think i ll budget for another one this year . 
for $ i couldn t be happier with this performance . 
i love this knife for meat ,  poultry ,  and seafood . 
other than that ,  its really a perfect set . 
i haven t had any problems with this item and would recommend it to anyone !   :   . 
this is my second jk adams pot rack . 
looks like you could drop em a few times before they would break . 
the hardest thing about making your own bread is slicing it  i guess that s why someone invented  sliced  bread  . 
i could not imagine cooking bacon in the microwave . 
this is the best steamer i have ever had . 
most of my cleaning revolves around this stuff . 
you have to flip two pads to open . 
i was careless and didn t pay attention and messed up my first one . 
it was a good price and we enjoy using our foundue pot . 
i ve fit four num_num pound lobsters ,  num_num pounds of cherry stone clams and potatoes without a problem . 
i still made it work for me just not in the way i intended . 
it was on time and has all they offered . 
the grill surface should be removable so you can really clean it . 
think about whether or not that will be an issue for you before buying this headset . 
now ,  a lot of people write reviews about how they are a pain to clean etc . 
purchased this to use to grind flax seed . 
what more could you ask for other than no batteries . 
it does what i bought it to do !  love it . 
it is perfectly balanced ,  so it doesn t flop or pull in any direction . 
the recipient loves it and uses it all the time . 
i got this as a gift for my daddy and it fits and protects his phone perfectly . 
however ,  though it may not win a beauty contest it does perform its stated purpose reasonably well . 
they work great and fit perfectly in my costco baking pans . 
that way i can buy them when they get a nice shipment in . 
i really like this headset and don t see a need to look for a different option . 
instead we found that the fabric was very nice and the case is constructed well . 
the reviewer who commented that it s hard to fill must not have read the instructions . 
we had num_num cooks in a num_num x num_num space ,  no problem . 
most importantly ,  cast iron is more brittle ,  so a cast iron wok can crack if not correctly handled . 
i have nothing negative to say about this can opener except that it doesn t clean itself . 
but my fingers still slide easily along it . 
even at that you can text and use phone without any problem . 
they are thick and hold up very well . 
for an inexpensive pizza stone ,  it does the job . 
frees up so much room in my kitchen . 
i ll be testing it on a trail this afternoon . 
these are great protectors and very durable  i m still using the first one of the three . 
i save so much time in cooking by boiling the water in this unit . 
charges much faster than the other chargers i ve ordered over the years . 
it s so comfortable that i can completely forget that i m wearing it . 
i have always used a fine ground or pods . 
i love having something portable to chase down all the fur my dog sheds !  . 
an important part to pay special attention to is the inside of the lid . 
and it was such a great price too . 
they are being pulled ,  twisted and so on . so i bought num_num of these at once . 
i bought this for my husband and he loves it . 
the quality  i think  is a slightly higher upgrade than what you d find at ikea . 
also ,  the handle broke off on my first one ,  so it needed replacing . 
simply turn to right or left for pierce to show . 
the timer instructions and face plate say to turn the nob passed num_num minutes  at least  ,  which i do . 
these are the best thing since sliced bread . 
i have owned several cases for my i phone and i like this one best . 
gave it num_num stars because it is still too expensive . 
either the polder is the worst piece of junk ever made or it is great . 
the camera is great as the reviews have said . 
even my husband ,  who won t touch yogurt with a ten foot pole enjoys it . 
better yet ,  a band that goes around your neck connecting with velcro . 
today ,  for example ,  i reached into the knife drawer ,  and cut my finger in this . 
i do not have an extremely large head ,  but it s larger than average . 
the guide notches fit right over the edge ,  and i didn t have to wash an additional bowl . 
my paring knife to my set disappeared ,  so i was happy to find a replacement on amazon . 
i m in the process of building it up . 
but is the baby george all it s advertised to be ? yes and no is the ambivalent answer . 
i only wish it had an opener for chicken broth without taking the entire lid out . 
if you leave one behind ,  hey ,  it s only $ totally pleased with these clever little gems . 
when i pour in my teacup it is still hot . 
just like the free ones from a new phone . 
all in all ,  this is an outstanding unit . 
btw ,  it s for chinese family ,  not sure if the usage of cutting board is different . 
the crack is at the right rear corner and extends about eight inches from the top . 
my only gripe is the velcro because it is loud . 
couldn t for the life of me ,  remember what these were called . 
it just works ,  very little skill or time num_extend
the track is like every other track ball ever made ,  it has problems but its ok . 
shallots ,  garlic ,  parsley ,  cilantro are all nicely chopped and no longer simply shredded . 
with the rod arms extended the board will not be nearly as sturdy or useful . 
i also really like the sound that it makes . 
i need more lids and they are difficult to find . 
it s a small inexpensive item that really does a good job frothing milk for your lattes . 
my son had two of these corningware mugs . 
shipping was great ,  had no problem with it . 
this one is larger than the others and the quality is much better . 
and it has really cut my cook time down . 
i use this every day !  i love this . 
so i bought these protectors ,  and installed them . 
i highly recommend the additional battery power to those who want it . 
this is a very minimalist case which is what i wanted . 
so far ,  i really prefer this grill and have been using it exclusively . 
hundreds of bowls of salsa ,  mountains of pie crust dough and barrels of shredded everything later . 
it is a big ,  lengthy ,  portion of natural cloth ,  i cut pieces of it and they last long . 
it is a metallic hot pink and very durable . 
i only hear it once and if it bothers you ,  you can follow instructions to turn that feature off . 
the bags are listed as num_extend inches in size . 
i ve had the $ krups and cuisinart models ,  which burned out within two years . 
the first year ,  it hardly got used ,  except at christmas . 
it s relatively easy to pair with my iphone and it s comfortable to wear . 
but the crank handle always came loose and just spun round and round ,  making it useless . 
they ve proven so durable they still look brand new even after many years of use . 
i certainly do not feel the need to put it away ,  actually the opposite . 
it won t work . always preheat your cast iron before putting food in . 
i found the following recipe for crumpets on the internet . 
better to throw out a few unpopped kernels than a bowl of burned corn . 
it is so wide that i can t pour the ground coffee into the coffee filter without making a mess . 
the edge is fantastic as is to be expected with global . 
we have two of these chargers and four anker batteries . 
the serrated edge cuts without pressure so the baked goods are not compressed when slicing . 
for less than $ i will be honest; i didn t expect a great tool . 
the extra voltage is also a great advantage . 
so i loaded the tank with the detergent and water and prepared myself for a dissapointing experience . to my surprise . 
the fact that it s preseasoned makes it a lot easier on my part . 
it just works and i m happy with my purchase . 
i successfully made yogurt !  it was easy ,  and very much worth it . 
it was hard to get on at first but it worked out . 
they are oem from the folks at rimm  blackberry  . 
i also installed a num_extend card in the phone and reformatted the phone and all is great . 
i used it daily to hold dishes i have washed . 
i buy one for every phone i get . 
also ,  be sure to follow the care instructions :  this pan needs to be seasoned after use . 
if function is the most important issue ,  this is the best headset . 
for $ something box ,  it is a great case . 
i guess that s about all one can ask for . 
i don t know how i could have gone this long without having the calculator . 
the tips are awesome ,  and cover just about everything you could need . 
sometimes you get something nice for less money . 
we purchased this item used from amazon fulfillment . 
voice quality is good ,  range is strong and provides solid voice commands . 
don t know if it is ruining the surface or not . 
it is always nice to have an extra cup when baking . 
so i do recommend any one to buy it . 
but for now ,  this is the best travel mug on the market !  . 
i d replace them with the same product if i lost them . 
hay ,  i can food alot and this canner is great for that . 
as soon as you see it ,  you ll be struck that it looks like a work of art . 
the screw is teflon coated so it goes in easier to minimize tearing of the cork . 
plus ,  for the price level ,  it works much better than anything i ever had from motorola . 
the top center portion should still be wet ,  but this when you may add cheese or other filling . 
but i put it on medium or high when we aren t in the room ,  and close the door . 
i bought this item a few months ago and so far it has performed flawlessly . 
sadly i already ordered another one ,  the num_num mah for a christmas gift . 
purchased this product and i am very pleased with it . 
i really dont know much about this and i dont seem to have this issue . 
also i haven t had it randomly disconnect as i turn my head as my other one did . 
make sure you add water to any leftovers when reheating to maintain soft rice . 
this machine is well worth buying ,  i will not buy anything else but one of these again . 
i am not a big fan of mexican food ,  but my husband is . 
the charger will show red while charging ,  then switch to a blue light when fully charged . 
i haven t had a problem yet but it just feels so very frail . 
love the innovative design of a two part case with a close and comfortable fit . 
i travel around with an iphone ,  blackberry bold ,  ipad ,  wireless hotspot ,  electronic cigarettes ,  and sometimes a camera . 
i love the mini sized because they come out faster when serving a crowd . 
it had to be manipulated in order for it to charged correctly . 
i use her method to keep the carpet clean  spot treat; use only boiling water  . 
these are the perfect size and utility for my daughter ,  who has started buying her grains in bulk . 
went on easily without any mishaps and is wearing wonderfully . 
i didn t like the fact that the stainless steel travel mug was plastic lined . 
buying a fresh battery from the rim source is important . 
the handles stay remarkably cool while the pot heats up quickly and efficiently . 
can t believe the difference since i have been using the steamer . 
based on the reviews ,  i did not expect the permanent filter ,  and there was not one in the box . 
i use them for everything ,  from bread to cookies ,  chicken breast to hamburger patties . 
my samsung eternity fits perfectly in the leather pouch once i put the hard rubberized cover on the phone . 
most of the fruit recipes are gimmicky and contain too many ingredients . 
since most mobile devices connect via usb ,  this gives a great amount of flexibility . 
i cook for just me ,  so obviously this would be too big for everyday use . 
it has very good range especially with my panasonic cordless phone . 
i bought two more and ran them in rooms our family uses most often . 
i have been using this for almost a month now and it keeps my tea very hot . 
the gauge is easy to read and has different settings . 
i make them for all holidays ,  weddings ,  and whenever the grandchildren are over . 
i m changing my review from num_num star to num_extend
here are a few pros and cons that i have come up num_extend
at the time i placed my order ,  i didn t know about microplane s professional graters  the num_num series  . 
it has some very easy to understand instructions ,  and comes with cute little cloths ,  to wipe it . 
which makes me second guess how it was . 
you basically have to purchase a whole new dustbuster . 
there are other colors and it was hard to choose which color i wanted because i liked them all . 
my outer box stopped snapping together with the internal protection . 
i have definitely gotten value for my money with this brand of cookware . 
we have about num_num pieces and this is one of our favourites . 
i will purchase again if i break the carafe for the num_extend time . 
i bought a num_num cup as well which works well when you need to make a larger amount . 
if you tighten the screw the paddle moves up ,  loosen it and it will move down . 
i got the pink one for my wife even . 
eventually ,  i got around to buying one for myself and gave her one as a gift . 
it s all about the timing of when each ingredient goes in . 
i never realized how much difference good knives made . 
heavy batter or a fuller bowl can relatively easily lift this shield up . 
cooks eggs perfectly every time ,  and they taste better than when made on teflon previously . 
my concerns are that aluminum should never be used in cooking utensils . 
however ,  after extensive decades use ,  they had to go . 
upon arrival ,  the pitcher appeared well made and stylish . 
be careful if you decide to purchase other cheaper backup batteries . 
the ear buds were also a perfect and comfortable fit and the most important thing .  .  . it stays on your ear . 
despite being smaller than my other blue tooth the comfort is much better on this one . 
i like it so much i bought it twice ,  after the first one was destroyed in a fire . 
at first i didn t realize i needed to calibrate this thing . 
current glass ,  including pyrex ,  is very durable; i have never broken a piece . these bowls work brilliantly for myriad uses . 
i did not purchase this oster breadmaker on amazon . 
 wow !  it is also very quiet in comparison to other machines . 
i still have this and i still really love it . 
my bed is low so i just put the controller underneath it ,  behind the bed skirt . 
the initial ones i received were awesome !  the second set was not . 
this filter is great if you have a small fridge . 
i understand that there are upgrades to the  red  . 
i highly recommend it . i m just blown away by the feel and the price . 
i have had it going on a year now .  . update january num_extend i own num_num of these . 
i say num_extend because i put num_num regular num_extend packs and num_num larger one . 
don t waste your money on any other plastic handle type . 
i replaced the battery in about num_num minutes . 
read the user s guide which walked me through an easy assembly and proceeded to cook a pot of beans . 
not for serrated blades ,  ceramic blades or certain japanese blades  wrong angle for santoku etc  . read the manual and practice . 
yes ,  the machine does have a rather loud beep to tell you the coffee is done . 
i like the battery meter on top and the easy on and off button . 
i have made small amounts in this larger size model and it is still cooked perfectly . 
i received this product on april num_extend num_extend
it just bothers more particular people like me . 
these units make the best tasting coffee i have ever had . 
the color seems to match well with the photograph ,  and the item itself is attractive . 
most all wilton sprinkles are okay; they aren t the best taste . 
here you just raise it up ,  and then pluck it out . 
great holder . my only complaiwe is the foam parts were damaged when i received the package . overall is great ,  highly recommend . 
i am extremely satisfied with this chrome trimmed cover . 
i bought this pan because i did not own a bundt pan and it was highly reviewed on amazon . 
i would have given it num_num stars if not for the exterior fabric becoming brittle . 
the small pour spout is hard to clean but otherwise and great kitchen tool . 
we used to drive num_num minutes and wait num_num hour for deep dish pizzas at our favorite place . 
breakfast will be my important meal of the day once again . 
this is the best iphone num_extend case that i have ever had  and i ve gone through quite a few  . 
i ve had similar products to this ,  but this is both the most compact and most reliable i ve used . 
if you need a replacement battery ,  this isn t a knock off ,  it is quality . 
when the grinder arrived ,  we were careful to follow all the recommendations and have had no problems at all . 
the ricer is very well made ,  as are most oxo good grips products and it works perfectly . 
i want a kombucha crock with spigot eventually ,  then i will use this jar for pickled eggs . 
the battery life you will receive with this seidio num_extend extended battery is simply amazing . 
its comfortable and gives the secret agent look . 
i don t use it as much as i used to ,  but still do occasionally . 
they are built to perform and to last . 
we have tried electric and mechanical can openers ,  none of which worked very well . 
i have not had this problem at all . 
great for whatever use you may need it for . 
there is a variety of tops to use depending on what you have in the bottle . 
it has a delicate look ,  but seems to be very strong ,  a very nice weight in the hand . just lovely . 
have not cooked with it ,  but it s great as a mold . 
i really liked that the product had the wrong and the right sides marked . 
i cook a lot of those marinated flank steaks from costco ,  my kids love them . 
i read all the reviews on this and other brands before purchasing . 
they re blingy and glitzy and girly !  !  it s not the most protection but it is a pretty case !  . 
too many times the cheaper charger fail quickly and have odd sized plugs . 
you can t ask to behave as a wifi hotspot with this small battery . gps is accurate and fast . 
good price point on this unit ,  i was happy with my purchase . 
the color is really nice and it fits very well . 
it is just long enough to hold my serrated tomato knife and my longer cheese blade . 
i ve purchased two of these to replace the two from kitchen aid . 
i had an old motorola razor cell phone ,  but it would not charge . 
i got mine new at a thrift store ,  but the price here is cheap as well . 
i guess the opening around the flash is not big enough and the flash bounces off of the cover . 
the clean solution tank holds one gallon of water  one reason for the light weight  . 
my boyfriend s mother uses these cookie sheets too and i plan to order a set of my own now . 
peanut ,  grape seed ,  and corn oil add different flavors . 
it s perfect for citrus zest for baking and parmesan cheese for cooking . 
i love butter so this item was a must . 
the microphone and speaker are completely covered but do not impede the transmission of sound . 
this is better than my swiffer since it vacuums up dust and pieces that the swiffer doesn t . 
this is a great mini chopper for prep work or light duty chopping . 
but ,  assuming that i don t wash our carpets that often  once every year . 
and the soft stayhear silicone tip keeps the headset comfortably and securely in place . 
this was a gift purchase for our son num_num who loves camping out in the wilderness on his own . 
great buy really for anyone that enjoys wok cooking this is awesome . 
cable is flexible and seems to have ok strain relief on both ends . 
i truly thought i had already written a review . 
i highly recommend this over juicing by hand or with a reamer . 
definitely big enough for triple batches of cookies ,  but doesn t fit under the cabinets . 
also when this charger is being used it will get very warm . 
it s a good quality hanger and dead useful . 
i only wish that i had purchased it sooner . 
other than the  flower shears  that we seem to have lost ,  these scissors get used several times a week . 
it does great job and sharpens all my knives very well . 
doesn t slice spongy eggplant well ,  but does great on many other veggies . 
i was sad when eventually my rhinestones chipped off . 
hate the plastic ones ,  and these are much easier to put in your curtain . 
i love this vacuum and want get another one . 
they are super easy to clean ,  they don t stain ,  and the lids all fit tightly . 
i am going to purchase another one because i often need more than one spoon when i am cooking . 
i haven t used the audio output feature yet but i m sure it works perfectly . 
diswasher safe ,  they easily snap on and off the plastic ring which makes them convenient to hang . 
this sealer seems to pull air out of the bottle as i screw it shut . 
i have had this coffee maker for over a year . 
we use it every night to cook our steel cut oatmeal in . 
wish the head had a tough scrub brush ,  but i suppose the flat plastic scraper thingy works as well . 
i don t think it will break ,  just feels weird . 
i dont use programmables ,  since that defeats the purpose of getting the best out of coffee beans . 
half the price of the cell phone store for the same item . 
i am always searching for something to protect my cellular phone . 
these are cheap and make the roomba more efficient . 
i run it all day ,  usually at the lowest setting ,  but turn it on high when i leave . 
the new design eliminates this problem but requires more work . 
the other spinners i had broke and were hard to clean . 
this is the second set of boards we ve purchased . 
he s always liked it ,  despite the bulk ,  but now it s num_extend more than paid for itself . 
i don t think the ribbed panini presses are as useful . 
some cases impair the use of the buttons but this case doesn t and allows full functionality of them . 
needed these for my dehydrater for smaller fruits so they don t fall through the racks . 
no problems inserting into my ears and keeps planrronics in place . 
i was looking for a product that would not require charging every couple of days or so . 
prefect alternative for your old wire whisk and no worries on your expensive cook wear . 
although i am not an engineer ,  i had no difficulty putting this together . 
excellent for those with limited space for sprices . 
we have had this toaster for over num_num years . 
when not in use ,  all three baskets nestle into each other for storage . 
i was going to buy a rowenta ,  but consumer reports recommended this one and i bought it . 
with just about any blade grinder you have the problem of the grind not being even . 
here in venezuela works with all the companies even in num_extend
the range of the headset is quite good ,  but i get more static in my apartment . 
read the directions when you first get it ,  spend a few minutes num_extend
i enjoy it with a little olive oil and himalayan sea salt . 
it pairs with both of my phones at the same time just by turning it on . 
iphone num_num has a higher resolution ,  but color saturation and black levels are just stunning . 
i used it for ice cream as well as watermelon and many more stuff . 
i like to take long hot baths and read . 
the connections are firm and positive ,  i have not had any problems . 
since this purchase ,  she has had no issues with battery life and loves this !  . 
out of then box it seems that anything made by samsung  apps  worked % without bothersome adjustments . 
the detailing on all these pans is deep and sharp and puts other shaped pans to shame . 
worth the money if you get it installed as designed . larry . 
it is a kitchen tool that will not go unused . 
i haven t tested the usb port yet though . 
my normal case is a much harder plastic ,  which is actually difficult to remove from my phone . 
this is by far the best and easiest can opener i ve ever used . 
i like the percolator first because i love really hot coffee . 
i notice this has only one heat vent not several like the older model . 
small and stylish but large enough for most bluetooth . 
it pops into the dishwasher after use and provides insulation to keep the coffee warm after pressing . 
i had to give up baking from scratch due to arthritis until i got this mixer . 
we use plastic and other safe utensils that should not have made any marks . 
this one has more suction than i d imagined ,  and it is very light . 
it cuts your cake layers perfectly even ,  quickly and easily . 
the norprp cast iron panini press is a very good and useful gadget . 
it was shipped promptly ,  not really much i can say about it other than it fits the jars . 
i have one of those big red fancy popcorn machines on a cart and i love it . 
it s four years now and it s still performing flawlessly . 
they fall apart or are not strong enough to hold a big back of chips closed . 
great for tethering your phone with a laptop or charging from your desk . 
until you try these ,  you won t realize how poorly most kitchen implements are designed . 
i was making a zebra cake and it turned out perfectly . 
i have owned many oxo products over the years . 
for one ,  the clip attached to the barrel is poorly designed ,  and difficult to clip to your shirt pocket . 
i have not tried removing it . when it comes to durability it has managed to hold up pretty well . 
it opens big cans as well as it does small ones like those little tomato paste cans . 
they are easy to wash and make for a nice accent . 
i am using all of the ones i ordered and i may have to order another set . 
who knew ?  easy way to get your daily serving of veggies . 
eventually ,  the two devices would fail to reconnect . 
it does everything it is supposed to do . 
they both love it and i would recommend this to anyone . 
excellent design ,  sturdy so plates can be stacked in the microwave ,  functions perfectly . 
i ve had my first pair for about two months now and just ordered another . 
i wanted tongs that would not scratch my nonstick cookware and these are just right . 
i need to order another pair of cans . 
i have had no problems with this thermometer . 
i have wooden cutting boards that i cover with these . 
it s a simple item ,  but is up to kitchenaid standards . 
nothing !  it even made my num_extend stand mixer look weak . 
the battery sits over the ear and is balanced perfectly . 
after a poor experience with the kensington dock ,  i eventually bought this and it is perfect in every way . 
after breakfast wipe it out with a paper towel and put it away . 
because it s strapped so tight ,  i have actually got a bruise when i did bicep curls . 
this is great when you want to just check how the cooking is going . 
it fits the phone very well and will protect it on small drops . 
there is a button on the top to search for the best signal ,  but i found it was unreliable . 
i do not know if the hard plastic would scratch the phone or not . 
looks exactly like the apple charger and works wonderfully . 
if i d got it elsewhere it would ve been num_extend and still might not have worked . 
i love this case ,  the color is really nice with the white iphone . 
it feels good in the hand and becomes an extension of it . 
needed a panini press for my le crueset square grill pan . 
and they double as a headset to make calls ,  which is a plus . 
it is affordable ,  easy to use ,  and cleans well . 
i recommend two important points when shopping for a purifier :  num_extend always examines the cadr number . 
this case is thin and looks like it belongs on the phone . 
every time i made tomato sauce i would scorch it unless i stood right there and stirred . 
it works especially well for grinding chunks of venison . 
this is not the average thin ,  wimpy apple slicer you may have seen . 
hand wash and immediately dry it and wipe it down with just a hint of oil after every use . 
get it !  !  !  !  yes !  !  !  !  i did not have problems with the garlic sticking at all . 
it s a little tight on my ears ,  but not painful . 
the welbuilt undercooked the bread ,  the cuisinart burned it . 
i would definitely recommend giving them a try . 
the different length cords to the earbuds don t bother me . 
when i ordered my droid incredible i knew i needed an otterbox . 
with the enclosed directions no one could go wrong with this . 
i did not pay upwards of num_num bucks for this ,  either . 
works so much better than a double boiler type steamer ,  or in pot steamers . 
i bought three of these and mounted without problem to back splash and installed the various utinsels . 
emptied the container and could see everything it sucked up . 
in breezy conditions the microphone was not affected . 
my wine stays nice and ready in the frig . 
i use it for almost anything that s going on the stove . its faults :  nothing serious . 
pushed the button ,  and added the water slowly as directed . 
so glad to have this back in my kitchen once again . 
i love the minimal static in the glass collection cup . 
enough for a dessert for my husband ,  daughter ,  and myself for two nights running . 
done ,  next kitchen tool to research  :    . 
unlike some similar products ,  nothing seems to stick to these mats . 
i originally got this for in the garage as well ,  for mixing catalyzed paints and clear finishes . 
it is powerful ,  easy to use and easy to clean ,  and the shopping experience thru amazon can t be beat . 
it s not as easy to clean anymore ,  but at least my food comes out normal . 
the color is true and the protection is good too . 
it is easy to use and toasts quickly and fairly evenly . 
i have purchased as good of protectors in bulk packs that ran me only a couple dollars . 
and % of the time ,  gets out all of the core and seeds . 
in the past i have used the cheap plastic hangers bought as cheap stores . 
love corelle !  i had some inferior dishes for awhile ,  bulky ,  heavy ,  and got screaming hot in the microwave . 
i learned it from new trent s website after i made those mistakes . 
i d order another one if i had the need . 
 also comes with a heavy gage plastic lid to guard contents from moisture .   will purchase again . 
the picture does not do this unit justice as most would overlook it as just a normal dispenser . 
makes bacon nice and flat and easier to cook . 
i ve used it on a mellon and a watermellon . 
they didn t like so now i have num_extend
like most kensington accessories ,  this works as expected . 
another plus is that i feel like a professional chef when i use these !  . 
battery life is short ,  about one continuous hour on a recent call . 
this pan is just perfect for a half a loaf . 
you need to find the sweet spot for this to really sound good . 
for me there is nothing better to cook with . 
however ,  do note that this style of headset with its mic positioning may present a challenge . happy listening !  . 
you need to do nothing if the bottle is just out of wine fridge . 
it is quite large if you are only frying one type of food without the center piece in there . 
the bristles aren t soft but they are not stiff either . 
the plug is tiny and can be used to charge any other device using a mini usb . 
otherwise ,  since it wasn t expensive ,  i consider it a satisfactory buy . 
you can use bar keeper s friend to keep everything shining like new . 
this product would be vastly superior if it had one of those . 
these scissors are good enough to cut chicken bones ,  and they come apart for cleaning . 
now it does have a more powerful fan than the num_num and creates more white noise . 
my wife actually had this on her wishlist and i purchased it for xmas i believe . 
i bought this to use as an adapter for the kindle num_extend
but it wouldn t if the machine itself wasn t fabulous . 
combine this with the right exercise and you ll be on the way to health living . 
i guess i d have to say ,  i like everything about this case . 
this works ,  but because its so small it breaks easily . 
keeps the phone nice and tidy and doesn t cover up the camera button . 
but let s start with one thing at a time . 
i was fearful that he may drop his phone and needed the added protection . 
i was fixing to do some mixing in my kitchen one day . 
the machine is nicely and snugly packaged with styrofoam and cardboard . 
brings back the old days when mama cooked sticks of cornbread to die for . 
extended battery requires different case and this is the one for protection . 
will be getting lots of use out of this cake pan  . 
lastly ,  i took out the ice cream and put it in a container . 
a food processor and a blender do process things very differently and now ,  i wouldn t be without either one . 
this was actually more expensive than finding one in a store like walmart or target ,  but i needed one . 
when i opened it up i noticed there was only one battery when there should have been two . 
this extra rack really helps to free up space . 
the only difference ,  however ,  is the handle style . 
this keeps them in tip top condition and always ready for their next use . 
it s the same product my cell phone provider tried to sell for $
syncing media with your iphone is much easier . 
tall and narrow ,  it avoids the splatter i ve experienced with shorter ,  wider measuring cups . 
you will not be pouring the powder on your ipod or the screen case . 
but this mitt has made the cleaning and care process simple and easy . 
with multiple device connection ,  i can use my cell and voip at the same time . 
not all of the kit are needed . the lift span of the priers aren t very good . 
i love this small canner so much ,  i m going to get a larger one ,  too . 
just got mine delivered today ,  and couldn t wait to try it out . 
each person that i have given one to has really enjoyed it . 
not that disgusting  tube o pasta  from the box . 
very convenient and would recommend anyone buying this . 
the original galaxy s has a somewhat larger bezel which is coated with a chrome finish . 
don t have one bad thing to say about it . 
the sharpener was well padded and wrapped in plastic . 
finally ,  we also use it for home roasting coffee ,  which is a cool hobby if you really love coffee . 
the case it comes with helps cover the point and that is a good thing to have . 
this coffee maker looks great on the countertop . 
i have had two blueant num_extend prior to this and i love the quality and features of them . 
this coffee maker makes excellent coffee and is priced right . 
i just let them soak a few minutes . 
they clean up easily with a soak and a soft brush . 
i suspect the confusion is over how capacity is measured . 
it s a good pressure cooker that works well for most of my cooking . 
i didn t really have a good idea of how small it actually was . 
so for chopping things fast if somewhat inconsistent in size ,  this is great . 
i simply do not understand the negative reviews . 
it doesn t last long at parties ,  that s for sure . 
this book was recommended by my cake decorating instructor . 
after reading other reviews ,  i thought i would give this reconditioned kitchenaid food processor a try . 
i purchased the oxo good grips large cookie scoop  oxo item number :  num_extend
when the three pieces came ,  i said oh i ll just have need for one . 
comfortable around the neck and i forget about them . 
i purchased this brush for the sole purpose of cleaning out my cast iron pans . 
the size of this is great for a refrigerator with little space . 
i recommend following  bahama dude s comprehensive instructions for a simple and easy installation . 
i use it to remove pizza from my oven . 
red cayenne color is much more durable and appealing over the red  the pictures don t do it justice  . 
the finish is flawless ,  the inside is nice and smooth ,  and everything fits together as it should . 
the num_extend does a great job of sealing outside sound in say like a crowded coffee shop . 
i would have preferred the back piece be wider than the sides ,  but all num_num are the same . 
your phone s screen is exactly duplicated ,  which by default doesn t take up much room on the screen . 
i did have to purchase a few more tips and odds and ends for the class . 
it s very well designed and it s easy to use . 
i m all the time hitting against it with my hand or whatever . 
it allowed me to turn the pot upside down to get all the water out . 
glad i bought the item ,  although i will have to be careful not to drop it !  . 
the shape is great as it works super well for deep frying too . 
for the size ,  this speaker is just pretty dang good . 
i will throw the disclaimer that i am a very heavy phone user . 
if you have a phone that this works with buy it . 
a much better way to store knives that did not come as a set . 
num_num inch length is the best length to weight ratio . 
when i place my order ,  i always know that i will receive them within the same week !  . 
what more could a girl ask for for her headphones ?  . 
and it goes with white and black checked tableclothes ,  graphic design napkins ,  red checks ,  you name it . 
for seven bucks ,  i m going to buy another of these before i get one of the more expensive sharpeners . 
also ,  no issues needing to reboot daily as others mention ,  or any of the other problems . 
so far i m very happy with this product . 
when you are always on the go ,  it s easy to forget stuff . 
i can clean after my kids are in bed ,  the soft steaming noise doesn t disturb anyone . 
don t complain ,  just take it to best buy and pay $ to have them put it on for you . 
the device is hands down the nicest looking handset out there . 
i will be ordering these again in the new future . 
my husband and i have and use our sets often . 
this has been used many times to cook great bacon !  !  highly recommend anything from lodge !  . 
the curved handles are a wonderful fit for small or large hands . 
the argyle pattern is very nice ,  and only adds to the design . 
it charges the ipad while docked and can fit almost anywhere . 
both my daughter and i cook and bake . 
from the previous testing ,  i expected it to stay put better . 
seems like it should recognize i m already a member . 
its much easier to handle and they take up less room in my utensil holder . 
great charger !  it is just like the original that came with the samsung infuse . 
i can t put in more than num_num cups of flour or i will burn out the motor . 
if you only have space for one foodsaver accessory in your kitchen ,  make sure it s the quick marinator . 
the inside of the cap ,  which doubles as a drinking cup ,  is plastic . 
i am reducing my cook times from the printed tables . 
i can t tell you to buy it or not go off what i said . 
you cannot use any kind of screen protection with the phone . 
it gets sufficiently loud and sounds good and clear . 
soy bean milk was not good with large pieces of pulp . 
surprised to see i have been using this crock for three years . 
my only reasons ,  and they are minor ,  for not giving this vac a num_num star rating is as follows . 
the thing pulverized the garlic right through and it s easy to clean . 
i love the colors fiestaware comes out with . 
i gave it to my son for his first apartment . 
i was very pleased that it chewed up the flaxseed . 
with the motorola num_extend it is impossible to actually lay my head down while wearing them . 
the holder protects your fingers from the sharp blade . 
other reviewers have used it on other vegetables and praise its production . 
you have to add a lot of fruit to get a decent amount of juice . 
it does not have enamel in the inside to discolor . 
and that s a heck of a lot easier when the snow s flying . 
it keeps liquids hot or cold for longer than i could have imagined . 
great if paired up with a bottle of saki to go with the set . 
before you buy a food processor ,  consider what you typically process . 
even so ,  don t plan on trying to watch tv or carry on a conversation with the thing running . 
these are great for any type of kitchens . 
i purchased this as an accessory for my pressure cooker . 
for the price i paid its worth the money . 
you can make anything out of this pan . 
you can buy john boos mystery oil which is a mixture of mineral oil ,  linseed oil and tung oil . 
i could not believe i had actually  out of the blue  picked a set to give to her . 
however ,  i am on the atkins plan for life and eating poached eggs . 
no movement ,  no separation ,  still looking like new . 
what more can be said about lodge cast iron ? i just made a deep dish skillet pizza . 
we registered for num_num sets on our wedding registry and received them both . 
great set of four cereal sized bowls with one bigger serving bowl . 
i just didn t notice that when i was assembling the safety cage . 
perhaps you could get some other product that does a little better ,  but at what price . 
it s so much faster than a regular pot ,  and the results are fantastic . 
the wireless connection doesn t have to be fast for that but it does have to be consistent . 
they make a huge difference when shredding ,  slicing ,  etc . 
i looked at the portable wired speakers such as ihome ,  but they seemed cheap and tinny to me . 
it is awkward to use them all hooked together so i store them without the ring . 
usb charger only ,  which may or may not be a good thing for you . 
i would recommend to prospective buyers that they ascertain their needs first . 
as evident from the picture ,  it has a nice contrast of white and pink . 
great if you are looking for the least bulk possible . 
we did brine for num_num hours before roasting . 
the  press  in french press does not necessarily mean squeeze the grinds . 
the ease of setup and the exceptional call quality are the biggest selling factors of this unit . 
i ve had it for a few weeks now and it works great !  . 
it is easy to use ,  easy to clean and just the right size . 
i love the color of my blue lids . 
that is much quieter .  .  . but it is twice the price . 
highly recommended ,  especially if you like bright red ,  this thing is bright !  . 
you can use them to cover the table ,  or the cutting block ,  or the counter . 
many units completely forget everything and you have to start again . 
however one of the batteries can t hold a charge anymore . 
you will love this pot and find many uses for it !  . 
i purchased this bluetooth because of the color ,  style and promised functionality . 
it s small enough to fit in my purse . 
it browns evenly and whatever i bake in it ,  comes out easily . 
deep fry chicken or simmer a stew .  .  . this thing is versatile . 
this is going to be around the house for a long time . 
i needed to shave a little off the sides because the i pad cover kept lifting the edges . 
it is fantastic !  !  !  i would recommend it to everyone !  it is also very attractive to have on your counter !  !  !  . 
of course ,  none of the sheet touches the burners while the burners are on . 
i have worn this on my belt daily for num_num months and it has held up very well . 
these were a good investment and protected my phone from scratches . 
this unit is a bit quicker and pulls a vacuum better . 
i love everything about this machine ,  even the waiting is okay . 
i have had the same one for over a year and it hasn t let me down . 
for cookies ,  this makes a good medium to large sized cookie . 
disclaimer :  i enjoy music ,  but i lay no claim to being an audio expert or purist . 
i ll just list the pros and cons of the num_extend
it is at once sickening and gratifying to see what appears in the clear dyson bin . 
i think for the price this is a great buy . 
i used the same amount of butter i always have . 
the screen protectors were easy to apply to my cell phone . 
to me ,  a flashing indicator means something is wrong . 
the mic boom is contoured to follow the curve of your cheek . 
i often the tools and they ve held up quite well . 
this is my second case for the iphone num_extend
do this and you ll get the instant read feature . 
overall it was a good buy with the holster . 
your phone will die much quicker than this headset when playing music . 
i yanked them out of my ears one time and the head of one earbud separated from its socket . 
they work great ,  they look great ,  and they will be around long after you pass on . 
the coating makes this splatter screen so much easier to clean . 
one for the office and one for the night table next to my bed . 
note :  the picture above does not accurately show the flat shape . 
great quality replacement cable to charge my android phone or anything that requires a mirco usb plug . 
i find i don t even have to apply a hammering motion ,  the pounder does it for me . 
it is well made and the perfect size for our family . 
a little flimsy ,  but i don t use it a lot ,  only when i travel . 
it works great ,  nice attachment on it to attach to my tab . 
the camera on the evo has a red ring around it and this cover helps blend it in . 
thank goodness it came with six of them !  . 
i kept chopping until the onions were the size i wanted . 
i have the most expensive covers and they each had bulky and stiff feeling in use . 
nice portable size and serves its intended purpose . 
variable speed is a feature i ve not seen on a stick blender before . 
my pitcher is  still  shiny on the outside ,  and sort of brushed on the inside . 
i like the compact storage tin as well . 
i really prefer using glass measuring cups for liquids . 
so i went online and found this ,  and bought it after reading all the good reviews . 
i have bought this for several people over time and they still comment on it . 
it s been accurate and has held up very well . 
so the raised grooves were toasting but not the valleys between ,  where the cheese soaked through . 
it s very easy to do and does not sacrifice sturdiness . 
get the sliding attachment and maybe another grater with different hole spacing . 
i cook one load while setting up the next until i am done . 
these are much sought after features by treo users . 
much better r than some of my more expensive knives . 
it ll be around forever ,  and i m glad it will . 
my favorite table in the kichen has gouges from years of family sitting together enjoying meals . 
seriously i love this dinnerware ,  it doesn t clash with anything and is easy to clean . 
it s easy to use and easy to clean . 
it is also easy to have get the pieces to a consistent thickness . 
i have been using sitram cookware for years and have been spoiled . 
much better than the free one she had on there before . 
but what of this blueant ?  yes ,  i d heard of it ,  but no one i know has one . 
this matched perfectly and is just what i wanted . 
the flavor is better and the design is improved over the ones i used num_num years ago . 
this unit can have the input cable changed to accomodate this type of side loading tape . 
just like the pre itself ,  the touchstone is an adventure to unbox . 
have had this case on wife s iphone for num_num years so this is a replacement case for her phone . 
since the amoled screen does not use power with black pixels . 
i purchased three sizes of these glass lids and have been using them for almost a year now . 
i love lecrueset and collect what i can in the dijon color num_extend
there is mounting hardware and the running of wiring ,  both of which are cumbersome . 
i wasn t able to use the lid with a turkey this large so i used heavy duty foil instead . 
turned phone off then on and have not had a problem since . 
i plan to give theseas gifts in the christmas season . 
the pictures online do not show the new design . 
we haven t had any trouble from using ours . 
no toxins in the air or in the food to worry num_extend
parts are dishwasher safe ,  but i prefer to hand wash . 
i ve been producing an assorted seasoned popcorn with this . 
this product provides sufficient power to use my ipad on long trips . 
i love it this product !  !  !  i have very crooked arthritic hands and had no trouble holding the steamer . 
i ve had no issues with people hearing me on this set while i was on the phone . 
i usually cook with a bit of olive oil ,  but it s fine without it . 
it feels great ,  doesnt look bad and protects your phone . 
explanation :  when i tried to select text on screen ,  it would never select the exact text i wanted . 
it s sturdy ,  ergonomic ,  well balanced ,  takes a good edge ,  and is very attractive . 
i am a big fan of all calphalon professional and commercial anodized cookware . 
so if you do not have extra usb cables you will need to purchase them . 
i bought two of them to give as gifts . 
i like this case because it fits well . 
the cord is a bit short for me . 
it is a bit heavy but it works great and conducts heat well . 
i suggest ordering a charger when you buy these batteries . 
what was not expected was the wait to get the product . 
so i got the ones that has the bus sticking out . 
shipment was quick ,  thanks amazon .  .  .  . keep up the good work !  . 
these corning ware mugs are perfect for reheating leftovers or warming up canned soup . 
the bowls are a really great size for lots of dishes . 
i have found the button to be a bit of a disappointment . 
i mainly use them with sushi rice and cutting sandwich . 
a good purchase which is also available in another color . 
works great on lemons ,  limes and small oranges  valencia  . 
other than that ,  it s a sturdy ,  durable kettle !  . 
i recently gave a skillet as a wedding gift . 
for what it is ,  a single glove ,  not a pair ,  i think it is over priced by about $
it hasn t given us any issues thus far and seems to be a pretty good machine . 
the feel was nice and the inside has a lining that is very nice . 
and i  m active all day so i don t want to plug my phone into an outlet . 
well ,  while opening my iphone num_extend i ve lost some of the screws ,  and needed to find good replacement asap . 
do not decide to put this together with a baby sleeping nearby . 
note :  i have a num_num toastmaster  no ,  i m not the original owner  that still works great . 
hopefully a phone firmware upgrade will fix these . this is the first cell phone i ve had with a real speakerphone . 
i received this pan in the num_extend size as a wedding gift in summer num_extend
i ll let you know after more extensive use . 
i have had the breadman num_extend for about num_num weeks now and i think i like this breadmaker . 
for the money you paid for it ,  it was worth the buy . 
i purchased two of these fans for my husband s studio . 
i will not be told what is good for me . 
it s stiff enough to stand on it s own and protects my mixer from dust and grime . 
you should also avoid using soap to clean the inside since that strips off the seasoning layer . 
you ll use water ,  time and effort rinsing this filter ,  after tapping out the grinds . less grinds . 
cookies don t stick to the racks and they clean up easily . 
fyi . it assembles fine and isn t too cheap feeling . 
that one had simply gotten old and didn t look as pristine as i wanted . 
i did not see the other two and hung it from the two eye hooks first . 
i didn t realize that the radio would not come thru on this ,  so you have to have earbuds . 
and add salt of course if you like .   it s great for healthy snacks . 
i usually cut off the fat then grind the meat and it works like a charm . 
it should be well heated before cooking and the more you use it the better it works . 
also ,  do not put these pans in the dishwasher . 
was surprised to see how dirty the water was in the water pickup container . 
i find myself peeling in amazement at the ease even gnarly veggies can present . 
i m single ,  but i like making a larger quantity and freezing the leftovers . 
no complaints other than i wish is had elastic around it to cinch it around the jar . 
don t let your phone s glass break and get this . 
i purchased the num_extend motorola bluetooth headset and thought i would love it . 
for an otherwise nice bottle ,  being made out of cheap plastic detracts somewhat from the design . 
better than using a towel ,  which could catch fire on the stove top . 
not what i thought from the ad and the pictures . 
it is a good little guy and seems to do its job well . 
great for make ahead meals for a quick microwave meal . 
i would have gladly given up an inch for storage reasons . 
i ve had some issues with wear on these . 
ready to move on to belt sander with impregnated leather strop . 
the definitions of  hepa  and  cadr  are placed at the end of this review . 
i bought one of these and promptly bought two more . 
in the past used a plantronics bluetooth ,  and i have two of those for use in the house etc . 
works great and quickly charged my iphone num_num over three times . 
make really good popcorn and the top is the serving dish . 
i travel a lot for work and this is the best purchase i ve made in a long time . 
and if it breaks there is no other way to charge the device . 
i got this fryer after seeing all the positive reviews for it ,  and i haven t been disappointed . 
i initially got this bowl to fulfill a promotion . 
i just had a glass of wine that i opened num_num month ago and it still tastes the same . 
i m online now to buy another one so i can bake double batches . 
i replaced one that had served for over num_num years with this product . 
as you close in on month six ,  buy a new box . complicated ?  not at all . 
the small plates that come in this set are the same diameter as the cereal bowls in this set . 
for the money it does what it is intended to do . two num_extend
cookbook is easy to follow and bread has turned out perfect every time so far . 
when i got it ,  i actually spent ten minutes looking through the instruction manual . 
my wine has stayed fresh for num_num weeks or more using these stoppers . 
i had a pair of insignia headphones that were not anywhere near this nice . 
i was a star this past week at my firm retreat with this battery pack . 
they are glass against glass not air tight . 
i have a hunch i ll be buying more packs of these . 
after a minute or two i hear hissing and it s at num_extend
this is a great addition to our kitchen . 
if you re looking at any current motorola headsets ,  stop now and look no further . 
i was skeptical ,  but pleasantly surprised by this product . 
you can t beat the price and they are very durable . 
my first one came from a national catalog . 
the cable works great with my iphone num_extend
i use this on my cheapo knives to keep them sharp ,  and it works perfectly . 
the only drawback is dealing with the grounds but it is really no trouble . 
although the sides are not straight ,  i didn t find this to be an issue in frosting the cakes . 
with the occassional calphalon anodized that is reasonable . of the two ,  my vote is cast for the all clad line . 
it will however ,  produce finely shredded cheese . that is a mere quibble with the attachment . 
after it cools down ,  i wash it with a scrub brush ,  hot water and soap . 
it doesn t seem to get salad as dry as my old spinner did . 
i don t know how i operated in my kitchen without it . 
this is a must buy for any working kitchen anywhere . 
this thing makes a great cup of coffee . 
as with all my calphalon ,  i love this . 
i bought these to use to hold fishing rods and long handled tools in my open carport . 
i bougt the $ breville num_extend when i started my bean habit and was considerably satisfied . 
these are easy to grab ,  slip off the ring and use . 
this is a good spare charger if  and only if  your phone was designed for a num_extend charger . 
the top shelf is used for lighter items ,  such as cartons of tea ,  coffee ,  boxed items ,  etc . 
it works great and you don t even know you have it on !  perfect !  !  . 
and ,  unlike many fiesta bowls ,  these do stack fairly well . 
so i do need to be more carefull . 
the unit quietly puts out num_num gallons of moisture daily which has greatly reduced my daughter s coughing bouts . 
the stream begins to distort ,  which indicates that a mess is on the way if you don t slow down . 
these pens are nice ,  but the one you purchase at the apple store are more effective . 
now i know it s better to have more than one . 
 :   then you can finally grill your chicken or roasts to the proper serving temperature . 
i searched this product put here on amazon for a small cottage kitchen . 
i have few friends already had different kind . 
a lot thicker material than the ones that came with my nesco . 
this tool popped open the case ,  and slid the edges open . 
then lightly flour the inside before pouring the batter into the pan . 
i have other peppermills that i will now use for other whole spices . 
i would buy it again . i think it works well . 
plantronics num_extend bluetooth headseti purchased the num_extend after heavily researching motorola and other competitor models . 
not to mention it is reasonably priced ,  especially with amazon prime . 
and then simply died one day last week . 
in fact ,  one of my friends asked if we had gotten new carpeting . 
i like it so much that i thought i would try mr . 
it also helps to keep it in your shirt pocket if you carry your phone there . 
this is about right for num_num people . i recommend it . 
once i figured it out though ,  it has been working perfectly !  . 
a fine product that actually does what it s supposed to do . 
the color of this phone matched pretty well what i thought it would look like . 
easy to clean ,  just don t ever use soap on the oiled surface . 
the two little ones are perfect for cheese ,  etc .  ,  and are thoughtful and handy . 
i like the look and feel of the design . 
this num_num inch stone fit perfectly and worked like a charm . 
she can knock my phones off of anything ,  even ,  literally ,  the top of the fridge . 
i make all my sauce and dough myself and like the way these cook my pizzas . 
i have owned three of them and the hd version is the best so far . 
if it had a pour spout on both sides ,  it would be perfect . 
i have nothing bad to say about this skillet . 
this has been the case with other calls i ve made using this headset . 
i bought this particular plug because the description says ,   heavy duty  ,  and it is worth it . 
the cordless was convenient but was powerless after num_num minutes of use . 
i like the fact that this one does not require any extra disposable disks to work correctly . 
i ve ground coffee of varying degrees of coarseness and i ve also ground whole grain brown sugar into confectionary sugar . 
i love these things they are always crafted differently each one no two are alike . 
if you are a coffee lover you need a french press and this is the one . 
i find that it runs very quietly and i am a light sleeper . 
if you want this one get it soon !  . 
i had been wanting to get a whisk and saw this one recommended by ci . 
i have used it almost daily for over num_num years . 
she wants to use her vizio android tablet extensively on the five to six hour flight . 
it s so easy to make any bread in here . 
disgusting ! the hoover steamvac does a great job cleaning . 
easy to clean and has held up nicely . 
in my opinion this will offer better shock protection . 
if watching the bowl sit flat on a counter is your main priority ,  then this bowl isn t for you . 
would make me think twice about buying this again ,  despite my apparent good luck . 
he has had this case for a good num_num months and its still holding up strong . 
i am still extremely happy with this purchase . 
if you love fresh pineapple ,  this makes serving it a breeze . 
these are extra large steak knives and sturdy . 
the presentation box was a nice finishing touch . 
the first one lasted about a year and a half and the tab that holds the phone in broke . 
i bought this after seeing many others for higher prices . 
cheaper can openers are just frustrating from the start . 
it s the exact same shape and size as the kitchenaid one that came with my mixer . 
right now i m listening to my pioneer speakers blare away to the avengers soundtrack . 
any more than that ,  you will have an absolute mess that takes so much time to clean up . 
i bought my first spiderpodium from touch of modern but it took several weeks to get it . 
its been over num_num years of use now and there is no degradation of performance or appearance . 
have used this effective and inexpensive product for years . 
while it is a bit heavy for this purpose i am glad i got it . 
using the coffee pot ,  i fill to the number of cups i want to make plus one cup . 
wood and stainless steel make for an elegant looking strainer . 
i would definitely recommend this pan to anyone who bakes bread at home . 
and a super buy at $ from the  friday sale  . 
and add salt of course if you like .   it s great for healthy snacks . 
they sound was far better than expected . i confirmed this personally the next time we were together . 
don t worry so much about the speaker hole just focus on those phone edges . 
i love color and these give them to me . 
we love this item to put fresh lemon juice in our cooking . 
i like the clear color because the sleek look of my num_extend isn t covered over . 
had i known it was going to be that small i d have gotten the larger one . 
found this one ,  read the reviews about the removable plates ,  and was anxious to give it a try . 
it is an amazing little cordless vacuum !  i use it several times a day for cleaning up after children . 
i purchased this pan to use at work on a hot plate and it works perfectly . 
it s also a great scoop to move your chopped ingredients to another container . 
it gets easier every time ,  and i m considering just leaving it clamped to my counter at all times . 
this was originally intended for that room but i don t want to give it up now . 
i like it because the top screws closed to prevent leakage . 
it says  lightweight  right in the title for gosh sake . i would buy it again . 
my wife thinks i look like a total geek . 
we ended up ordering another squeezer for lemons . works well ,  looks decent . 
do all your shopping on amazon with it ,  or play games . 
its something that you don t think about until its too late . 
people that complain about the quality of them must just be using them wrong . 
it will also charge another usb device at the same time . 
has a built in screen protectr that might not work if you have one on there num_extend
this phone does everything from num_num megapixel cam to really good internet speeds . 
my husband and i both are so glad i did . 
supports fast charging at num_extend and a good connection at the micro usb port . 
yes ,  this product does it s jb very well . 
don t forget to add a small amount of salt to the water . 
glad i listened to the reviewers who praised this brand . 
i needed cookie cutters to make a variety of sizes of hearts . 
i use it alot and the quality of this oster product i would have to say is supurb . 
also ,  the price of $ can t be beat . 
came quick usps in envelope and each boxed . 
i ll order another soon been telling people about it . 
i have a couple of these and the lids do wear out . 
plus they were much cheaper than the ones i previously bought at the verizon store . 
i got them for the price ,  i think its a steal . 
this is a gift for a friend who did not have a headset . 
i m charging the battery now so i ll test it again in a few hours . 
the filter basket stopper must be on wrong or something because it leaks when you remove the pot . 
can be compared to the incase slider which sells for almost double . i love the dual color theme . 
as other reviewers have said ,  the clamping could use some work . 
we finally decided we would get one ,  so we did . 
it makes a great bowl for popcorn when you re watching a movie or other tv fare . can t go wrong here !  . 
the new foam cushion feels great on the ear . 
bought this to replace higher end wire cheese slicer . 
okay i bought this for my first ever smartphone droid num_extend
you will not go wrongbuying this case because it is a great protector . 
i have bought several cold steel items and i am always happy with the quality . 
i wear it most of the day ,  on project sites ,  while driving ,  even at home . 
universal standard usb connector means no special cables needed in a pinch or extra parts to lose !  . 
if you have to pick between the two ,  i would suggest the num_extend
if i had sprint service in the office i m sure the battery would last num_num days at a time . 
an excellent alternative to the standard white and it cleaned up very easily in the dishwasher . 
was able to consolidate knives that had been stored in other drawers . 
either one is weighty ,  so you aren t going to gain in that factor . 
other then that not so bad for the price . 
i will update this in a few months when i have used it more !  . 
this is a great product ,  gave it a num_num stars because it does everything it stated it would . 
after cleaning ,  it makes the air feel lighter and i feel good that i m not using chemicals . 
the steam fast was the right price on amazon   $ so i bought it . 
the screen protectors have been very useful in keeping my htc incredible screen nice and protected . 
plus they come in about num_num different colors . 
even with a few bubbles though ,  i like the matte appearance on my phone . 
it just stopped working .  .  .  . i feel really ripped off . got this one yesterday . 
most of the case damage to my phone was when opening it to insert a sim or sd card . 
i didn t like the look of my plastic tupperware and wanted the cleanliness of glass . 
he has not yet tried this item but very anxious to try it . 
one thing i don t like is the big letters on the side . 
the packaging was superb ,  battery was wrapped nicely . 
i don t care if it s heavier than other vacuums . 
it s also very easy to clean since there are now only two parts to this . 
they stack nicely as long as they are not over stuffed . 
for those who complained about drip marks on the exterior surface i have this answer . 
as advertised ,  it does a great job of mincing garlic . 
i will continue to buy these for my new iphone . 
it charged my playerpretty quickly ,  only a few hours . 
how did they taste ?  pretty much the same ,  except the trader joes organic was tougher and more chewy . 
the skin peels after a few months but oh well . 
i am using this cable to charge a bluetooth earpiece with any usb port available . 
it fits perfectly on the glass turntable; cleans easily or throw it into the dishwasher . 
thank you for and great price and great product . 
all in all this was a great value and will last me years . 
i can not wait to see what capabilities android num_extend and num_extend will give to my evo . 
and ,  the butter slips into the water a little as well . 
we have convinced many people to purchase this model . 
we will buy from this company again  if the ones we got ever wear out  . 
i havent had a hamburger press for a long time . 
it is a must forthe cast iron cooks out there . 
the glaze has held up great to cutting of the butter . 
when you assemble it ,  but it is a little powerhouse . 
they re great in the dishwasher or washed by hand . 
you can easily get accurate measurements from standing in a normal position . 
i like the oblong shape for the many roasts and briskets i make in it . 
bento for small things ,  but it doesn t do nearly the job of keeping things warm as mr . 
i love the heavy weight of them and i love the fact that they are not plastic . 
i m considering one for my permanent residence . wonder if i can find it in white . 
this thermos is very nice looking ,  and it keeps things warm for a very long time . 
i would say you should replace it every num_num or num_num years . 
no more bulky knife holders and this is brilliant . 
i m even eating more cereal due to the ease of using my new dispenser . highly recommend it . 
the case fits the voyager like a glove ,  with the long necked microphone fitting behind a piece of num_extend
i have several of the micronet towels ,  which i use as my regular towel . 
best coffee grinder i ve ever had !  solid ,  reliable ,  easy enough to clean ,  perfect for getting the right grind . 
for the price though it is worth it . 
i would recommend this mixer ,  but i d be a little weary and realistic about its durability . 
during our discussion they gave me instructions on how to apply the shield to the face of my phone . 
the quality of the cover is very good . 
then i add the flour ,  salt and water and start the cycle . 
the circumference of the lip is just a little too large . 
i can only assume it s doing it s filtering job ,  but i use it mostly for white noise . 
i think these num_num ounce mugs are the perfect size . 
 i ve previously tried plastic designs which lasted for exactly one use  . 
the ballistic hc case for the iphone is the extreme case for the extreme user . 
this case also has a kickstand ,  just like the phone . 
i can t talk about the longevity of the case or the finish but it seems to be pretty good . 
making jerky or drying soaked freshly blanched almonds etc makes it easy to lift off the dehydrator . 
i did a lot of research ,  and i came across this set . 
i have been using this product for many years ,  and i highly recommend it for red wines . 
this was my first experience with a moshi moshi handset ,  and i have to say i was blown away . 
some people don t use any soap because the pot is seasoned much like a cast iron skillet . 
i think great coffee is a little bit miraculous ,  and it s worth a little extra work . 
this alone makes the press worth while . easy to clean . 
it is easy to use and i like its metal construction . 
again ,  just another case of you get what you pay for . 
if you re used to drinking grandes at starbucks ,  this is the perfect size . 
turns out it is the real deal ,  in the original retail packaging ,  and appears to be new . 
it checked all the boxes needed on the design requirements listed above . 
it is the same qualityas the original and lets face it .  .  .  . you re kinda out of luckwithout it . 
i guess i ll just have to live with it . 
it has held up well with very little visible scratches . 
it has stood up to all my abuse and works awesome . 
hello , i bought the screen covers for my cell phone and so far not complaints ,  very good productthank you . 
keep them oiled up and they will last a lifetime . 
the camera is unobscured ,  and all the buttons and ports are protected . 
the pie cooked way more evenly since all of the apple pies were uniform in size . 
today it s $ and it was $ when i bought it . 
i put them in a pot with a bit of water and simmered them until they were soft . 
easy to add appointments ,  just pick a date and start typing . 
the fan is large so the heating process is rather quick . 
wonderful ,  lively pattern; makes one happy using it . 
i suggest going right to the website for a better pdf version that is readable . 
the only two negatives is that the top is plastic and should be replaced by glass . 
and the mic people dont notice the difference that im using one . 
it is frustrating trying to get the baked loaf out of the pan . 
after having pottery ones that are porous and do not work ,  this little gem keeps the butter fresh . 
i purchased this and a few days later purchased the miu num_num thermometer ,  one for each fridge . 
it s so much healthier this way !  it works great over my air popped pop corn ,  too !  . 
especially for long periods . overall ,  this is one of the nicest headsets i ve used ,  and would recommend it without hesitation . 
i love the feeling of it in my hands and its just so cute !  . 
it is terrific for grilling onions ,  mushrooms or mixed vegetables . 
these are the regular brita pitcher replacement filters . 
it fell on some uneven concrete ,  and while the case got scratched . 
on the treadmill  ,  they seem to do a good job deflecting moisture . 
i found this griddle for a great price ,  and it was reversible so that was a plus . 
while i was not convinced this knife would work as advertised ,  i thought it was worth trying . 
i bought my bread machine a few weeks ago and i use it every day . 
they arrived in a large box ,  with really nice packaging ,  for the travel . 
now ,  i ve finally got a little class . very satisfied . 
reviews for this product are all over the place on whether they re airtight or watertight . 
yes this is great on the stove top . 
pan made this is great ,  but using a stone puts it over the top . 
a few common sense suggestions here :  the bowl is large and a little heavier than you re likely used to . 
or buy a second base for other rooms or for very large rooms . 
i would change a few things on it to get five stars though . 
great item easy to clean and to use . 
i have a lot of cases for my iphone . 
couple this with some great beans and a french press and you will have incredible coffee .  .  . guaranteed . 
it does what it needs to do and works for me . 
i thought apple would fix the problem in the recent num_extend update but no luck . 
i would get a universal dock if that is the case . 
if you are on a budget ,  build your collection slowly . 
after being away from home and no cell power after num_num pm i carefully researched portable external batteries . 
so after that the rice continued to burn to the bottom of the pan . 
it then came in handy when i had to portion num_num servings of cream cheese . 
so it should not be released in food . 
wish i had known this came in a matte finish . 
i m using it for the first time today . 
after receiving i immediately installed it and loved the darker red color . 
i have found this brand to be the best . 
he fell in love with the whole concept the very first time i made him breakfast this way . 
there is a steamer basket as well as a strainer for pasta . 
would recommend to anyone and everyone with an iphone num_num or num_extend
we store a lot in mason jars and this vacuum attachment does a great job . 
there is a small learning curve to master . 
this is the best coffee maker i have ever owned . 
this works perfectly for me ,  plus i love pink . 
my original mixer was received as a wedding present num_num years ago and it is still going strong . 
i haven t used the accessory hub yet ,  but i know it will work wonderfully . 
nice you do not have to go fishing in the jar for the one you used previously . 
finally i found the right cover thanks to the explanation on this site . 
i found new covers from amazon and should have used amazon in the first place . 
this is a big issue for those of us who want to install a ton of programs . 
they cut magnificently and are well made ! haven t tried the flower snipper yet . 
this is every bit the quality and  rustic  look that i ve been seeking for sometime . 
i ve had no problems inserting the droid into the multimedia station . 
i wasn t sure what to expect with these pasta bowls as i purchased them sight unseen . 
yup ,  just like others the template was off but i jerry rigged it to work . 
however it cleans very easily .  . just rinse and scrub briefly with a metal brush or pad . 
well ,  it will fit in the left side of my double sink . 
this pitcher sits on our kitchen counter next to the coffee maker . 
i hope to never have to find out . 
i glue num_num of them together to make a base for my large num_num tier cakes . 
my aqua colored cover gets marks on it from my black belt case . definitely recommend this cover . 
the spinner continues on its axis long after the last pump . 
i have already bought four of these sets . 
then i go back and do num_num slices on the first side and num_num slices on the other side . 
this case is really two cases that combine to protect your phone . 
i personally prefer the grand prix ,  but this is an issue of personal preference . 
excellent size and does not give extra bulk at all . 
it sounds great looks nice and small and its not to expensive . 
comparatively to a  store bought  plain yogurt starter ,  this start makes a more tart end product . 
i will be buying more for friends and family . 
however ,  the anker charged both units and only dropped down to % power remaining . 
it protects the phone and i love having my cards in there . 
it is a high pitched whine .  .  .  . still worth it when you think about the powerful motor and workhorse capabilities . 
i love how it allows me to have my cell phone ring in different places throughout the house . 
we have to tell our guests to be careful when using . 
plug in any usb item and it has started charging them . 
however it tends to leave the meat very dry so it takes some getting used to . 
when you think about it ,  this unit can be pretty dangerous . 
there s a lot of of online comparisons between these two blenders . 
i have never had overcooked food in this slow cooker . 
but that is part of it being stainless and unbreakable . 
this is the only stylus of it s kind i could find on amazon that clips into the charger port . 
they never fail to put a smile on the faces of those who receive them . 
i am actually very pleased with this product . 
these are faster ,  much more comfortable ,  and produce much better results . 
the battery life is as bad as reported and yes ,  i know smartphones use them up . 
however ,  they chip too easily in the dish washing machine . 
love the individual colored mats for fish ,  meat ,  veggies ,  etc .  .  .  .  . helps avoid cross contamination . 
this is a nice reasonably priced pen for this use . 
this electric sharpener did just as advertised and put a nice blade on all my knives . 
this spinner is also about the right size if you make salads for one or two people . 
i ve started walking ,  and i have always hated having a cord when listening to music on my ipod touch . 
interlocks prevent the grinder from operating if everything is not in place ,  which should prevent any inadvertent mess . 
it came well packaged and fit my phone like a glove . 
this allows me to add a few more inches of water to my tub so i can really soak . 
it came with alot of silverware for the price . 
this item arrived quickly from the seller and it works just as advertised . 
initially when i saw this charger i thought it would be nice to use but wasn t worth the cost . 
i sent the necessary details to otterbox and they sent me a new one free of charges . 
so these however are great ,  the front just goes in my stash with the others . 
as long as you follow your directions to the  t  ,  it will last probably for generations . 
got this and found it easy to put up and heavy duty . 
put the old ones out front for trash pickup and they disappeared almost immediately . 
voyager pro+ only beeps ,  and does not offer voice controls . 
only drawback is sometimes it doesn t crack the num_extend very well and you waste one . 
i m kind of rough on holsters so having a spare one is great . 
worked great for the three months that it functioned . 
it is easy to use and comfortable to hold . 
great purchase for me ,  i use this several times a day . 
that is the spot that seems to frequently collapse . 
i own an ipad ,  kindle touch ,  and a blackberry . 
at this point ,  i may not ever buy the keurig . 
i owned a vitamix before $ and the juiceman is equal in it s power . 
i also want to continue using the holder in my cabinet . 
i got one because my husband had one and raved about it . 
i ve never been a hot coffee person ,  or much of a coffee person in general . 
they literally last forever or at least a lifetime or two . 
not a wind tunnel ,  but exactly what i expected out of this small of a fan !  . 
the blade moves slower than other slicers i ve owned in the past ,  but it works very well regardless . 
a much safer way of heating up your meal . 
the furniture is metal so i was hoping to save some space by utilizing the doors on the cupboards . 
 note :  do not attempt to  snap  the back plate onto the rear of the bumper piece . 
oh ,  so you know ,  your great great grandchildren will enjoy them too . 
a quick spray before cooking and after cleaning will keep this piece in great condition . 
i drink about two quarts of coffee each weekend morning ,  so hot coffee for four hours is important . 
we wanted a good one ,  but most of the good ones are incredibly expensive for the average user . 
i don t have any real issues with this unit except the volume . 
i had num_num units til instead of returning tp cingular . 
no it is not real leather ,  but who cares ?  it only cost $
they look ,  and are labeled like the original charger for the atrix num_extend
the only thing i don t like ,  having to reconnect every time i restart my truck . 
temperature is accurate . had trouble with the handle coming loose after second time using . 
my new years day brunch was a delicious success . 
the product came quickly ,  and it is what it says it is . 
we just pour the eggs into the pan and pop it into the microwave . 
as a vessel i use primarily for handling large volumes of liquid ,  it is ergonomically nearly perfect . 
i am committed to healthy cooking ,  so not having to use oil to prevent sticking is a plus . 
thanks amazon really are trusting and very confident in their transactions . 
you have to put a bit of wrist power into the pounding as its quite light . 
as julia child reminds people all the time ,  a fine paring knife is a must . 
i have one in scarlet red and one in black . 
swing the filter back and then let it filtered through into the pot . 
i read some horrible reviews about kitchenaid blenders but this has the new gear box housing and works well . 
the only negative is you can t listen to your music through this headset . 
the packaging was pretty cool ,  with a magnetic clip ,  and the product was easy to take out and use . 
i can t believe some of the reviews written for this case . 
it takes time to get it right ,  but once you do it s the coffee version of good sex . 
my first otterbox series hybrid case for my bionic tore after about a solid year of use . 
hamburgers  fat tastes good ,  lets face it num_extend
my measurements are now accurate and i don t worry if the sauces are going to be good . 
i have purchased num_num cheap rice cookers until this one . 
i purchased because they were recommended by cooks illustrated . 
the stems aren t the most durable around ,  but that s expected . 
this was great for mash potatoes ,  carrots and yams . 
i purchased this as an extra fro travel ,  works well for both phone and kindle . 
it s large enough to hold the galaxy num_extend with a hard shell case on the phone . 
they all perform their function well and with style . 
for roasting chicken or turkey ,  i like a stainless steel roaster  with an aluminum core  . 
price is right especially when crepe making is an occasional event . 
this is my one and only case for my blackberry . 
the donvier is not restricted to just these recipes but can handle others as well . 
the next thing i noticed was the beefy holster and the wide ,  ratcheting belt clip . 
well taken care of ,  it will provide years of good service in your kitchen top and oven . 
this hoe is not the same ,  however .  the pan is just plain simple and the output is oh so good . 
the standard size and type of acrylic board used for years . 
i suspect these will last about a year or so ,  and then it will be time to replace them . 
i ve read another user s review about how the lettering came off . 
i ve used them in this capacity for a few years now . 
it is heavy enough to not tip over with utensils in it ,  and the color is a vivid red . 
i am glad i bought this instead of a fancy coffee machine that froths . easy to use ,  easy to clean . 
i ve had two plantronics that i liked ,  but wanted something less bulky . 
feels cheap but has gone for multiple charges . 
this case is a perfect fit ,  the screen protector is even surprisingly good quality . 
if cook s illustrated recommends it ,  i m buying it . 
the balance and grip of these knives are as close to perfect as i have found . 
this microplane is a zester and very good at it . 
they have averaged about five years of daily popping . 
i do wonder if the store bought espresso with its finer grind ,  delivers better coffee . 
i love the ease of use and ease of cleaning . 
i can mix up the flavorings or have none ,  whatever i feel like . 
easy clean up and i prefer the manual wind up cord system over any automated spring action thing . 
quality product . the cord could stand to be a little longer ,  but it is of a decent length . 
i ve never had a vacuum with better suction ,  no matter what the price . 
i used it constantly until num_num when hurricane katrina flooded my home and i lost it . 
these knives are useful and helpful when serving cheeses while entertaining . 
i don t need it at all in everyday circumstances . 
he tried the hard cooked eggs and the shells just slid off the eggs . 
kept water much warmer and for longer than the carafe it replaced . 
if size ,  battery power and transportability are important ,  this is the way to go . 
i would totally recommend this case  !  i already have like num_num of these and they do the job . 
they are heavy duty ,  will last a lifetime . 
the lid was very simple and easy to put on and i had no trouble with it at all . 
okay .  .  . i really did a lot of research before buying this product . 
they are cheap when you think about ,  my local hardware store sells them for a little bit more . 
for $ this product is a must have for handheld tech users . 
it is so nice to know i am covered . 
i tried every apple cable i could find ,  and even ordered a higher end cable than apple ships themselves . 
it s easy to clean ,  pours without making a mess ,  and closes very securely for travel . 
i was obviously having a ditz moment ! the value of this item ,  just in food saved ,  should not be underestimated . 
the old one failed to release one too many bundt cakes . 
i could wear them all day and not know they were there . 
screen protectors were identical to those purchased from verizon ,  at a much better price . 
i think they should offer it with a glass top for the price . 
liked the first one so much i got a backup for party time . 
it does not work for cheddar at all . 
some obvioiusly do and i m sorry for that . 
apparently it takes some skill or trial and error to get it right . 
not entirely since it does full num_extend hd recording and has a num_extend camera . 
mind that edge ,  folks . edit this post | permalink . 
 in our experience actual  bag clips  are much too large because they get caught on things in the freezer .   . 
i gave this as a gift and its perfect . 
once you find that ,  it s easy to use and to find when the phones are on . 
my bissell has a heat option that keeps the warm water warm . 
no worries about the mechanics breaking at this point . 
i m a longtime virgin mobile customer that was also a helio customer before and after vm acquired them . 
i bought this for my mom of num_num yrs old . 
i began to avoid recipes calling for zest . 
the set is attached with a ring clip that is also very durable so they won t come apart unintentionally . 
my fiance also got the num_extend on our upgrade . 
there are cheaper ones which does the same job ,  but this product has a good design and a stand . 
fits perfectly and is exactly what i wanted and order . 
love my fiestaware for years but they are so heavy on my aging hands . 
we tried cookies once and they came out ok ,  but we probably wont use it for that again . 
it is the only one that i have seen that will also work with an ipad . 
even when something sticks to it ,  it comes off easily unlike before . 
it had a tiny tiny slot in it for a strap . 
our old one broke so we went with this one ,  refurbished . 
don t burn the butter ,  but let the pecans cook slightly . 
i like it so well i ordered num_num sets . 
i was pleased with the num_num piece tea set made in china . 
i like the purple sparkling iphone case , it helps protect my iphone . 
wilton excelle elite make a great line of metal baking pans . 
i m glad it has the extra cable so it can go into a computer . 
it has a lot of power and chops food very quickly . 
from the many online reviews i ve read ,  early versions of the num_extend had problems with lockups and dropped calls . 
another big plus for this model is the button layout . 
now it does go down very quick but as long as you charge it after every use . 
the first time or two ,  take your time . 
this in an invaluable kitchen tool for making homemade gravy and soup . 
they work pretty good and the sound is great !  they are a little flimsy ,  but they should be fine . 
it s solid value too ,  so that makes me happy . 
it s also easy to assemble and easy to use . 
you have the option of not having to have the sweeper attached to the battery charger . 
don t waste your money on high priced name brand cases . 
this pan bakes up a great num_extend bear cake that will wow everyone . 
i ve purchased num_num from other places that didn t work for syncing data ,  so i was quite pleased . 
in the num_extend mom was sold on joe dimaggio s pitch for mr . 
got it in the mail and followed instructions to get it working . 
if you re a fan of the french press ,  you really can t go wrong with the frieling . 
as with any cast iron pan ,  it cleans easily and cooks awesomely . 
great control ,  great whisking action ,  fits perfectly with a tiny footprint in my top drawer . 
still ,  it does its job ,  and is really easy to clean when necessary . 
the products arrived promptly and work as advertised . 
this osterizer i ve been using for several years ,  and quite frequently . 
my screen remains crystal clear and the touch sensitivity has not suffered one bit . 
for years ,  it is way too big for every day ,  single person use . 
these batteries outperform both and for a much better price . 
thid does an excellent job of cooking eggs . 
using two or having to scoop out the ingredients three times . 
i love anything zebra print and this was no exception . 
i have used this many times ,  but can t seem to roll as well without handles . 
it looks just like the picture shows !  !  way better than plain shakers . 
works perfectly !  !  i am very happy with the purchase . 
arrived on time . easy to use but too much waste for an expensive product . they protect from freezer burn as advertised . 
a lot of other vaporizers have lasted a year or so and then i throw them out . 
everything comes apart ,  so you can just throw it in the dishwasher  in the silverware tray  . 
i was after a grinder that would give me consistency without spending an arm and a leg . 
i only use it a couple of times a year !  . 
i use these in all of my kitchen drawers and in the boudoir ,  too . 
i have found it practical for stir fry and other similar cooking . 
i ve always pretty much looked at cooking as a tedious chore . 
last time i bought belts for my hoover they were oem . 
it has a longer usage life and can be left in the charger too . 
i had a couple of good brands in the past for those everyday needs and they expired . 
i ve used these for years . however ,  just now i couldn t remember how to change it . 
truth be told ,  this is a must have ,  and i want one . 
i ll have to experiment and see if i can do better . 
being vegetarian ,  i ve used mine exclusively for fresh vegetables and rice . 
so i guess if you are fussy about hand fit you should try this baby out before buying . 
the opening for the micro usb connection is slightly too small . 
it is perfect to pick up crumbs etc . 
it showed up fast and looks very good . 
this is maybe the best of auto phone holders . 
beats the hell out of using a pyrex cup all the time . 
these mats are easy to clean and last a long time . 
charger works and the battery lasts longer than the stock battery that came with the htc sensation . 
i can only imagine generations of italians have used this same unit and it probably hasn t changes in ages . 
it also comes in a hard plastic case that can stand on the counter ,  if you wish . 
you ll remember how it used to taste when you were a kid . 
i gave the set num_num stars because ,  for the most part ,  it worked as described . 
the cutters i have do not mate with the hole inserts so cutting donuts is a two step operation . 
bluetooth works well with active sync and cordless num_extend
this  oxo good grips measuring cups updated design  set ,  is lovely . 
i wish they had one for iphone plug . 
i bought this pot for the sole purpose of being able to bake dark soda bread in it . 
if you don t need to wear your phone on your hip ,  stck with this horizontal version . 
to be more connected to certain tasks i . feel is fulfilling . 
i trust kitcheaid so i didn t hesitate to buy this oven thermometer . 
this is a great quality press and it cleans up so easily . 
and ,  it works awesome with a num_extend too . 
plugged it in ,  got my cell phone to sync with the unit . 
i can t believe i did without a pair of these for so long . 
mine still looks almost new with minimal darkening of the heating surface . 
and it is not trackable .  .  .  .  . you kinda have to take it with blind faith that it is on its way . 
i could tell the difference of good and fresh new rice from others that are not . 
as long as you can manage your cleanups within the available battery power ,  you re going to be very pleased . 
we use the top as a measuring cup . 
how can it not ?  it s kind of awesome .  phone features : awesome . 
it would be suitable for a couple or a single person . 
and the cable and charger are both legit motorola devices . 
if you looking for a small food processor this is your answer . 
the lid handle and side handle have never been too hot to touch while heating the water . 
it s not a charcoal one ,  for example ,  that would readily absorb all the cooking odors . 
this is a perfect pan and roasting rack for the turkey or roast . 
it is much sturdier than the ones i ve used in the past . 
the gel tips and loop makes it very comfortable and fits nice and snug . 
well ,  let s just say i only tried that once . 
this is perfect for my cotton swab container . 
i bought this at the same time i bought an otterbox . 
so i decided on the zojirushi after reading all the reviews . 
otterbox has never really disappointed me with the defender . 
they are so thick and of such high quality that i can t imagine i ll ever need a replacement set . 
however ,  after a few months and several dozen cans ,  it is certainly doing it s job . 
i enjoy the weight of the glass and the handle ,  it feels comfortable to carry and to pour . 
it works with usb charging cables to recharge your devices . 
it never overheats the coffee ,  never burns it . 
i then had to clean each cup individually . 
it plays audio through it well and charges . 
basically ,  just a quick swipe with a wet paper towel should do the trick . 
we ve been very pleased with this toaster oven after using it for a month . 
my favorite feature is the button that controls the sound level the recipient of my call experiences . 
we replaced the standard steel mesh with a charcoal filter replacement from our supply for the kitty litter box . 
these work great and i will buy again !  thanks !  . 
i read a lot of the reviews on here . 
seems to be well made and feels sturdy . 
you can actually see the pollen ,  dust ,  pet hair ,  etc . 
i regularly go num_num days before charges now . 
the docked view is nice i was thinking of using this instead of my normal alarm clock . 
this item arrived on time and is an excellent purchase . 
overall it fits my lifestyle perfectly ,  both professional and personal . 
really no major complaints and boy can it clean !  well ok i guess i do have one complaint . 
the isi spatula heads are a lot longer than the head on these oxo small spatulas . 
my favorite is the jawbone for clarity of conversation but this one for staying on your ear . 
the slicer from the grocery store ,  the dollar store and a superstore ,  all of them had handles that bent . 
this battery case is a good battery life extender . 
the larger one works great with her big family and large cast iron skillet . 
this is good quality and will be a pan that i use for a very long time to come . 
the buttons are very clear and make sense . 
the trick is to not overheat expensive coffee beans during the grinding process and this unit does it well . 
that s so much better than red or blue . 
personally i like the slimmer phone but my wife has the seido num_extend and is happy  lasts num_num days . 
looks great and everyone asks where i got it . 
given the exceptional price under contract ,  this phone is a no brainer for those looking for an upgrade . 
makes excellent waffles ,  easy to clean ,  compact size ,  good quality . 
upon first receiving this item  items  i found the charger to have a faulty contact . 
this spatula is the first i ever owned made of silicone . 
we use this pizza cutter regularly since it was purchased about num_num years ago . 
once before i tried ordering a blackberry battery on line and it turned out to be a fake knockoff . 
works great ,  i love the extra usb plug in . 
bought this as a gift for my mother for christmas ,  she loves it . 
i purchased these knives to upgrade my num_num year old set of the same type . 
when we returned home ,  the bread was not molded and was edible . 
this is small ,  handy ,  inexpensive and works great . 
i quickly wiped it off with paper towel and didn t think about it again . 
impress your bbqing friends by bringing it with you to cook on their grill . 
note that your contacts ,  calendar ,  and tasks will continue to be stored the internal memory . 
but that won t be for a very long time . 
they gave me a credit on the initial order to cover the cost of purchasing the missing parts . 
five minutes later it s nicely crisp on the outside ,  with hot melted cheese on the inside . 
the jabra supreme is the one i am keeping . 
the speaker was very simple to set up and connect to my phone . 
charges fast and and stays charged for a while ,  has plenty capabilities and looks good ,  too . 
other pieces fit best for taking my lunch to work . 
yep , if you had one of these grills in the past ,  then you know exactly what i m talking about . 
the pan sits firmly on the glass top . 
i used this machine on a rug by my entry . 
for a family who uses a lot of sugar ,  this bowl would be small . 
needed a new battery ,  so why not go big . 
etc .   these containers make a pefect way to keep them . 
a sticky label does not affect the function of this excellent saucepan . 
it was the first whisk i have ever owned and i really love it . 
i can use the plastic cup in the microwave to reheat coffee . 
what a beautiful pasta rack !  there are plenty of arms to hang pasta and tall enough for my need . 
it works spectacularly with hard cheeses like parmasan ,  shaving it effortlously into tiny curls . 
and the handle does not get to hot frying them . 
the headphones are really heavy on your ears . 
at full volume ,  the good news is ,  they won t damage your hearing . 
i ve only used this to steam my dumplings and it does a wonderful job . 
we did a nice trout minuere last evening . 
open it up and fill it with whatever you want  feel free to be creative  . 
i really like the fact you can charge the case with the phone in it . 
it did not produce the smooth ,  creamy taste that they enjoy . 
the installation was so smooth and quick ,  i was amazed . 
great fit and superior protection for your iphone num_extend
you have to get right next to it to hear it . 
and of course the first one is cold by the time the second one comes out . 
my family has tried several brands of this same design . 
i actually use an iphone num_extend but also have an older evo num_extend on hand . 
i ve even used it on tomatoes  don t exert a lot of pressure  ,  celery ,  grapefruit ,  oranges ,  turnips ,  parsnips ,  and carrots . 
great timer ,  quality seems to be much better than the other brands i bought over the past few years . 
i plan on keeping this phone for a while and i feel it is a great value . 
i used to dread shaking and knocking the old filter outside ,  with dust blowing back in my face . 
surprised at the water that came off from the spin . 
from the tracfone saving book it wouldn t take it . 
i have purchased two different covers for the current phone i have . 
they fit properly and we have no problems with them . 
being in the side vent of my car keeps it very handy for viewing and hearing . 
the grills are removable for easy cleanup ,  which is a nice convenience . 
i was tired of having a metal ladle and fearing that it would scratch my pots . 
we have used different grinders for many years . 
perhaps i m not looking correctly ,  but the functionality is very limited with the multimedia dock . 
i am sometimes limited in the things in which i can make in this pan due to the depth . 
it is strong enough to do a good job and does not harm your pots . 
it works well with a wide variety of devices . 
the oscillation feature is really cool ,  and it s a very quiet fan . 
now if it could also quickly bake cookies and play cool music we d be set . 
i like this original nokia charger .  . very cheap but shipping is more expensive than the original price . 
once your phone is fully charged ,  however ,  it turns off . 
i would recommend anker batteries to anyone needed to upgrade . 
this one works for me ,  hence ,  my take on it . 
the different options  fine to coarse  for grind are nice . 
however ,  the phone works as advertised and continues to receive meaningful updates and features from google . 
the permanent filter is nice but depending on how finely ground the coffee is ,  it can cause problems . 
my three bedroom apartment is long and narrow ,  with window unit air conditioners at either end . 
the size is perfect for keeping gravy warm ,  i use it for veggies and warm dips for parties . 
if you have sensitive skin ,  you will need to change the cord it comes with . 
it s very light and the calls are clear and crisp . 
i love it but wish i could get a smaller one . 
the bases are heavy and sturdy ,  i don t worry at all about these tipping over . 
bowls and lids are durable and dishwasher safe . 
i use this almost exclusively for making muffins ,  pancakes ,  and cookies ,  and it works great for that . 
i had always known that cooking under a higher pressure would accelerate the cooking process . 
we love this sleek unit that holds up to num_num cups of rice . 
i am asked often where did i purchase the case for my blackberry . 
one is meant for phones while the other is meant for larger tablet products . 
i have always used an egg slicer but after years of usage ,  it finally broke . 
very pleased with this product !  .  .  . just wanted to add a note . 
please have the model number ready when calling .   . 
using multigrain bread flour and following the recipes included with the unit the bread comes out perfect . 
also ,  however ,  ubuntu is extremely weak on usb microphone compatibility ,  so that may be the problem . 
it allows for more space in my drawers . 
the   .  .  .   ,  which is a nice vacuum but clogs easily ,  especially with pet hair ,  or bit of paper . 
with the hourglass shape of these glasses she finds gripping them to be much easier . 
amazon should update its picture of the product . all in all ,  i am thrilled with my beast of a skillet . 
they either left too many kernels unpopped or the cheap materials cracked; i encountered both problems with the nordicware . 
the grease catcher is very useful and perfectly built . 
i like the fact that it is filled with our olive oil and saves on the amount we use . 
i bought it for easter and have had it on my phone for a while . 
this eliminates that . if you love retro technology .  .  . this is for you !  the price is right . 
this is a wonderful dutch oven by lodge . 
i guess that i am just too picky . the one i am currently trying out is this plantronic voyager num_extend
it looked like a million dollars and tasted deelish even without icing . 
it s an awesome dual fan that can exhaust and intake . 
great value ,  about % less than what palm was selling it for . 
its nice if you don t have any space to put your phone in your car . 
my mother was estatic as she can use them with some coordinating dishes she already has . 
thats the only thing i had a problem with . 
people really think its a cassette at first glance which is funny . 
other than that ,  the case fits the iphone num_extend perfect . 
they look and remind me of hearing aids . 
this spreads out the force of the blows and minimizes tearing . 
this thermometer was recommended by a leading consumer products company . 
just use a towel to as a barrier ,  though . 
not bad for the price ,  it s hard to even still find this one . 
if you spray oil the cloche inside ,  the parchment will stick and form fit easily . 
it is very light and easy to carry . 
can t tell you how pleased i am with them . 
i absolutely love this bluetooth !  when i m looking for a bluetooth headset there are num_num things i look for . 
the second port is a great feature too . 
i use it all the time even though i have num_num cases . 
could i melt butter or heat up pancake syrup in the microwave ?  sure . 
putting contacts in this phone is very easy . 
start with the driest ingredient first so the contents are less soggy . 
stuff some teabags in it ,  pour boiled water in ,  and every last cup of tea will be hot . 
i bought this set because they were a bit cheaper so if they break i wouldn t be as frustrated . 
great filter for the honeywell room air filtration system . 
he drops his phone a lot so an otterbox is a must . 
i drive a num_num ford edge and the windshield is pretty deep . 
just followed the directions and it worked fine . 
i am into cast iron and i like lodge for new stuff . 
highly recommended for those who don t mind a little extra effort for a well brewed coffee . 
the blades are as sharp as a surgical scalpel . 
i am a quadriplegic with very little hand dexterity and find cutting and chopping extremely difficult and time consuming . 
so ,  i just wash the potato ,  put it into the machine and whomp !  ,  instant fries . 
i will try that next time and see which is easier . 
i was afraid that it would break since the tagine was for the oven . 
i love all oxo products and even more so since the experience with their customer service . 
unlike plastic ,  the stoneware cleans completely and does not transfer odors . 
love the size because it doesn t seem to big but well protected . 
it has a couple of flaws ,  but let me get to that in a second . 
i evenuse the itorch when on the road . 
for about num_num bucks ,  i ordered one of the glass knobs just as a backup . 
i only bought it because it was black . 
this arrived in what appeared to be a nokia retail package ,  and had nokia insignia on the cable . 
this is the best num_extend pan i have every owned . 
the lids fit nicely ,  are not too hard to put on or take off either . 
best sound quality of any bluetooth headset i ve used . 
this only happens every once in a while  ,  but it requires reboot  ,  rather irritating . 
i too ,  did a lot of research before settling on this grinder . 
this juicer ,  although big and a bit bulky ,  does a great job . 
loike the original ,  it works ,  what else can uou ask for . 
the website says it will play those ,  but it didn t . 
three leds don t really give you a good idea of how much charge is left . 
the blade comes off with a twist and washes up quickly with soap and water . 
it retracts very fast ,  which makes me wonder if that will eventually damage it . 
i d seen people asking if it is bpa free . 
i was floored by how much life this gave back to my phone . 
it was easy to line up and eliminate the air bubbles . 
she already had one that she d been using for years . 
i love the quality of the sorrento line . 
it was way too big and i had to sew it and even then it didnt work . 
i got this knowing i would have to trim it to fit my ipod . 
cuts are straight and consistant in veggies as well as the meat i bought it to slice . 
the earphones paired easily with my phone and computer . 
it did a great job and i was very happy with it . 
just pop the bottom retainer ,  pull the old one out ,  move the wires ,  and snap everything back into place . 
this is so well made and works great . 
this set is the best of both worlds . 
i got this guy mid summer and wish i had purchased it sooner . 
sure ,  this isn t something i expect to use all the time ,  but they were . 
have only charged them one day ,  and after a week ,  still work fine . 
you can also brew directly into one or both of the thermal mugs . 
but once purchased don t forget to put in the water filter . 
the case was great for the few months i needed it till i got a new phone . 
i m tired of having to hand wash pans . 
for example ,  i love to use it to whisk polenta into boiling water or to quickly mix dry ingredients . 
looks great and isn t rubbery so it doesn t stick to your pocket . 
well ,  i will probably change my phone before this charger breaks down . 
i have a fetish problem collecting iphone cases . 
they are good when using with an external battery . 
i use it to charge my htc sensation num_extend and my garmin gps simultaneously and it works just fine . 
perfect for num_num big mugs and a little left for heat up . 
even the turner is large and comfortable so it does not dig into your hand while opening the can . 
well ,  that was a design overkill since the rack was staying open fine without the detachable two arms . 
but on the bright side ,  i now can enthusiastically say that this coffee press is perfect !   :   . 
and to have a top that fits so well onto the pan . 
between my wife and i ,  we just don t have enough time to keep so much floor clean . 
as stated above ,  read the instructions and you should have no problem . 
the dishwasher has assaulted them with flying pieces everytime it breaks . 
although it does still work without removing the case . 
i need to hold it in front of my mouth for it to work ok . 
i got a couple of these adapters when i switched to an htc evo and they work great . 
it is easy to clean and fun to cook in . 
the hotplate as never burned our coffee yet and we leave it on for its max time . 
this is much nicer than i was expecting . 
he loves it !  it s easy to use ,  easy to clean ,  and makes delicious food !  . 
this set might be overkill for someone who doesn t enjoy ,  or doesn t do a lot of cooking . 
i have had no problems with the lid at all as others have experienced . 
bottom line :  this makes a good cup of espresso !  follow others  tips . 
very easy to put on just like any other protector . 
look great in the room and he says they are very comfortable . 
i had another one of these that leaked . 
just from the feel of it you can tell it will do the job it s meant to do . 
i ve had this thing for years now ,  and use it all the time . 
cambro can be purchased at most restaurant supply stores either clear or translucent . 
the mixer is large and will take up room on your counter . 
this is a perfect replacement for my cusinart num_num cup coffee maker . 
it s very rugged and utilitarian ,  but i m not that hot about plastic . 
the attached cleaner for this and the overall design . is great . 
the butter melter on the top is silly . 
i just upgraded my blackberry from the num_num to the curve titanium  tmo  . 
i have even sauted vegetables with no oil sucessfully . 
i bought this about num_num months ago and really like it . 
we used the phone s gps on a num_num hour drive to georgia . 
not so with the plantronics ,  at least for me . 
i bought this knife and block set as a christmas gift for my wife . 
i gave this to my wife for christmas . 
if i realized how simple the installation was ,  i would ve replaced the battery a year ago .

it took awhile to come but it was worth it . 
i ve been using this for about a year . 
the middle of the perforated area is ever so slightly elevated . 
the prefilter is recommended to be replaced every num_num months for optimal odor removal . 
this was a very good buy in my opinion . 
my dear husband loves to help out in the kitchen to save me time . 
this is a common error message with num_extend party accessories ,  and not unique to this product . 
i love my motorola photon num_extend but the thing is a battery sucker ,  that s where the num_extend comes in . 
it will get num_num when it lasts num_num months !  . 
i baked a quick bread in it and used parchment paper and it worked fine . 
place setting consists of :  dinner plate; salad plate; bowl; mug . 
i gave it four stars ,  because i would have preferred a firmer curd .

i ve had no problems ,  and have been very satisfied . 
plus the price is right and it ships for free !  .

i don t know that i would buy it again without checking something else out first . 
while i prefer the griffin ,  which cost num_num times as much ,  her s actually work great . 
it stays in place when exercising and provides easy access to phone touchscreen through the case . 
it takes some getting use to because of the num_num different containers .

i should have read the fine print but as far as the pitcher is concerned i am very pleased .

a recommended but for the price and value . 
it s a simple machine that fullfills the measure of its creation .

it works extremely better then my motorola num_extend or plantronics in the car at high speed with windows down . 
i bought this great little vac to replace my broken eureka quickup ,  and wow ,  what a difference . 
i understand the reason for this ,  but it makes it just a little less useful . 
like another reviewer ,  the first batch of muffins had  tough  bottoms . 
things with thin handles  like shrimp forks  do fall through the bottom slots . 
battery lasted longer then with the old battery .

everyone in the family uses this num_extend knife all the time . 
sprinkle a little asiago cheese and leave the cover up a notch ,  cheese garlic toast perfectly melted . 
the carrying case really came in handy at the office christmas party . 
the only plastic parts are in the feeder . cleaning is a bit messy . 
this is the perfect size dutch oven to cook a large can of corn ,  or beans . 
it seems that some just go into motion ignoring the handbook . plates fell from the clips was another interesting one . 
the case is right but the color is off . 
just wish i hadn t let fear keep me from starting this num_num years ago !  .

the reviews on this grinder are very entertaining . 
it keeps the ice cubes frozen for hours . 
bass drums sound like somebody slapping a pillow . 
i ve made mint chip ,  premium vanilla bean and strawberry . 
this one seems like a strong hold because the threaded bolts lock the heavy lid down super tight . 
the only thing was that i wish the cable was like num_num ft longer . 
the crust is better than you get in the bakery . 
now i just need someone to put on a good screen protector for me . 
cannot argue with this one ,  it does the job ,  and it works every time . 
one of our most used tools when cooking . 
if you re ocd ,  id suggest not getting this . 
i have had mine for about num_num years and love it . 
also since this is a qualilty silicone ,  lint and dirt wont stick so it always looks clean and new . 
he was looking for the exact same one he had before  another belkin  but could t find it . 
my phone now lasts all day which it never did on the stock battery . 
i can cook hamburgers on it without it falling apart when i turn them over . 
i figured if i use it at least once a month ,  i could buy a better one next year . 
we saved the money that a new coffee machine would have cost . 
we have also used it for a large steamer . 
easy to clean and so far ,  we love it . 
still slices well enough that i do not have to worry about accidentally cutting myself . 
i just needed something basic for the car ,  and this has been reliable for our iphones . 
the balance and grip of these knives are as close to perfect as i have found . 
i got mine for $ with free shipping . 
if you can get the kit on sale ,  it s totally worth it to try it once . 
it looks beautiful sitting out on my granite counters . 
it is just the right size and is very cute . 
but ,  honestly ,  i ve never heard a quiet coffee grinder . 
now my phone holds a charge for the entire day . 
it makes the coffee in the to go cup or most any kitchen cup . 
even the instruction booklet is out of order . applications :  it has lots of applications and they work very well . 
i use mine with the small wuesthof chopping block . 
i ve not really cooked with any other products ,  except farberware . 
i got this for my num_num year old mother . 
yes ,  this is the second best can opener i have ever had . 
this case is fantastic and i even got a plastic crowbar because once it snaps ,  its secure . 
you don t have to say more than pyrex when you want quality durable products . 
sometimes before we even sit down ,  if people are slow coming to the table after cocktails !  . 
this is the perfect fit manufacturer replacement belt . 
nothing is locked in place ,  put it wherever it works best for you . 
i recently moved from dry colorado to humid maryland . 
yes ,  it is a plastic cable and yes ,  it is a bit short . 
i dn t have to worry about that now . 
exactly what i was looking for ,  perfect for herbs and grinding very small quantities . 
the colors are more vivid ,  and everything is more crisp . 
however ,  it has never given me a problem ,  six some odd years later . 
the mount itself is well constructed and installs easily . 
the strainer can be turned over to drain smaller cans ,  but i haven t tried it yet . 
this seems to be a solid and dependable pepper mill . 
justcase aced it ,  and kudos to them for that . 
a decent product; however ,  it was not the right product for my phone . 
it feels sturdy without being heavy or bulky . 
these bowls are the perfect size for a hearty bowl of homemade soup and sandwich . 
then once a week or so ,  i take it off and scrub it with a soft cloth . 
this is hands down the best little chopping machine i ve ever had . 
this is more than your average scooper ,  but it is very well made and should last me years . 
however ,  it works well to infuse tea and make iced tea with teabags . 
my bluetooth arrive and i could not wait to try it . 
took us a little while to figure this out ,  as directions in book are somewhat unclear . 
i purchased the smaller size and it fits perfectly under my desk . highly recommended . 
on getting this water out ,  i noticed it smelled of stale ,  old water . 
this replaces my bemis that i had for num_num years . 
even the old pyrex dripped so i don t see any change there . 
for the price though you really cant complain !  . 
i have been looking and comparing these for awhile . 
this is my fault and not the fault of the machine . 
i discovered this when i used a friend s ,  bought it when i had the need ,  haven t regretted it . 
i think it takes a bit of extra time due to the heavy base . releasing pressure is very easy . 
this is a great product !  one thing i was sure wouldn t be good was the little connector pieces . 
the cutter is not high enough to cut a whole potato at once . 
french fries are a pain ,  don t bother :  hand cut them with a knife . 
just don t put the top on the carafe until you have filled the reservoir . 
this attachment has been a real useful thing . gary peterson . 
it s great ,  i love it ,  but the handle is too short for my liking . 
i love that it comes with a well fitting plastic sleeve for safe storage . 
it is a business tool to me and gets constant use all day every day . 
i bought the tablecloth some time ago and needed more napkins . 
for a few $ this little device works just great ,  charging them in under an hour . 
i purchased it a couple of weeks ago and i am using it all the time . 
this case is good good case if your not one for carrying a a brick in your pocket . 
our cats like to knock them over ,  empty them out ,  and then play in them . 
the grips interfer with the buttons on the side of the phone .

i have tried so many ,  and i have found that i hate anything hanging on my ear . 
i see reviews of people saying the skin is too small . 
i plugged the dexim in and static is gone . 
it conncected quickly via boluetooth capability to my samsung fascinate galazy s . 
the adapters will catch on and ruin the pins in your phone if you are not very careful though . 
my family still uses this item and it works well . 
my bunn is awesome ,  it keeps working and working and working . 
i like a sideways phone holster better than a vertical one too . 
in addition with rough sided home grown apples ,  it can skip some of the peel . 
of my entire knife set ,  my wusthof santoku is by far my favorite . 
my old hoover carpet shampooer finally bellied up . 
in fact ,  she was the one who got this for me as a christmas present . 
thicker body might offend the  my phone is smaller than your phone  purists . 
i purchased this fits all sizes cover ,  thinking i would possibly be returning it . 
and they offer several bluetooth headsets for cell phones . 
this still seems to be up the the kitchenaid name . 
in my experience with an iphone num_extend s ,  i ve had very good luck with this earpiece . 
when it s charging something else ,  there are two leds that show that everything is working . 
i have no idea if i have followed the instructions on use correctly since they are in japanese . 
good protection for the screen so i don t worry about putting the phone in my pocket with keys . 
a little heavier than i thought it would be ,  but will sacrifice that for the extra power . 
we have both the straight and fluted cutter set and they work great . 
it s easy to clean ,  and is dishwasher safe . 
since i don t have a big ,  strong man around ,  this is the next best thing . 
but it has some nice touches that some other dutch ovens don t have . first ,  the general num_extend quarts is .  .  . well .  .  . a lot . 
gotta be on your toes and get them off the heat . 
it is still available within bb messenger ,  but just not text . 
took a long time to get here ,  but i was so happy when they arrived . 
however ,  every time i clean it i seem to slice my sponge in half . 
i have not had a single day without making   fresh   coffee . 
this is the first review i have ever written about a potato masher . 
i suggest you use this under an exhaust fan by the stove ,  it can put out some smoke . 
i had my headphones plugged in and the phone in my pocket . 
as many have noted fit is this device s biggest weakness . 
none of the juicers i had used in the past could match the num_extend power setting on the breville . 
i liked the design ,  but the small plates are really small . 
it stays on but is still easy to get off . 
i have never been a person that can use his phone while plugged into the wall or the lighter . 
i do long weekend bike rides about num_extend to num_extend per day . 
i handwash all the parts ,  and wipe down the base with a towel . 
it s a screen protector .  . works well def buy if you need one . 
as will taking it out of its case . 
it is easy to put together ,  use ,  wipe off ,  and take apart ,  and it stores small . 
i don t use any double hooks on this rack because i find it too small for that . 
too expensive to buy one every three months . 
this case definitely helped save battery life on my pearl . 
i throw the pizza on the pan ,  stick it in the oven for about num_num minutes and perfect pizza . 
i only compare this jawbone to other jawbones .

the plastic lid is a nice touch to protect from dust . 
i get % battery after num_num complete day of usage . 
super fast shipping ,  product as described ,  fits perfectly . 
i received this  unexpectedly  as a gift from my brother for christmas . 
thejabra extreme bluetooth headsetis so far the best headset that i have used . 
it was squeeze and steam ,  than wipe ,  and so on . 
a brush is needed to scrub the imbedded garlic . 
used it in a leg of lamb once and was accurate  used my digital one in the other leg  . 
i chose this decanter for my first try at decanting . 
i love this steamvac !  we have a dog and a toddler so our carpet is constantly getting little stains . 
comes in multiple sizes to fit every need . 
this was supposed to be a christmas gift for my husband ,  but he was home when the package arrived . 
i looked at several makers and decided on this one ,  due to price and design . 
since i have bought this thing ,  i have not used an iron . 
the third just has rings at either end . 
bought this product to make smooth baby food . 
just don t expect the last few drops to pour nicely . 
i really like this grill and look forward to using it to cook other items besides steak . 
i love the spice rack and the glass bottles . 
i have had one of these since num_extend
bought this kitchen aid in num_num and it is still going strong !  use it very frequently . 
each piece seems very sturdy and i expect many years of use . 
i have had this air purifier for about four years ,  and it still works very well .  .  . highly recommended . 
paired with the recipes from the book  artisan bread in num_num minutes a day  i ve had wonderful results . 
i use this tiny little skillet almost daily during the winter to quickly melt small amounts of coconut oil . 
easy to operate and no issues grabbing the can . 
the result was truly delicious ,  by far the most moist poultry i have eaten for a long time . 
i do salad ,  soup and a sandwich ,  sometimes with chips or a few pieces of candy . 
practice on a garden knife not your henkels . 
it really wasn t good when about six boxes of boots tumbled over in the closet . 
they feel sturdier than any pans i ve used before . 
can t beat num_num additional batteries with a wall charger for less than $
i used this exact kettle for around num_num yrs . 
eat as much as you want !  as stated ,  you can use the paper concentrators over and over . 
i purchased the farberware num_num cup percolator to replace my other farberware percolator that i had for num_num years . 
i bought a new battery figured the battery needed replacement .  .  .  . no luck . 
it is a great size ,  cooks evenly and clean up is a breeze . 
i ve had this grinder for over two decades and it has performed well . 
putting it on and taking it off is very easy for those stands that don t leave room for cases . 
the change to a horizontal display is great with the ability to dim or brighten it . 
at this price ,  i can t pass up the opportunity of adding additional d arques pieces to my collection . 
but you have to get used to how it works . 
i think the handle is a bit flimsy ,  and could have a better design . 
a hemostat would work too but the tongs release more quickly  handy when you re about to burn them !   . 
i ordered this rack to attack to my tiny dish drying rack for my tiny apartment kitchen . 
please see my review of the frieling primo teapot with infuser ,  num_num ounce . 
i also have trouble with attaching it to different surfaces . 
another review stated the cord cannot take too much heat . 
some days are better than others ,  same as always . 
i have used this product twice and i learned something you should know . 
i love having this because now i don t feel as if i need to have chargers everywhere i turn . 
it keeps your bird off fat and juices so it will cook more evenly . 
i wish it went directly to off or had the option for warm or off . 
i don t drink much coffee but i do like a cup every now and then . 
at first ,  by the look and feel ,  i thought it was  cheap  . 
no problem with the bread sticking at all ,  good crust ,  good moist crumb . 
for the money even if they all have a life span of a month its still worth the price . 
i don t mind the little extra to make all things work well . 
the size is perfect and lets me do a large volume at one time . 
it actually feels like there isn t any protector on it at all ,  unlike a silicone case . 
i didn t buy this and the num_extend skillets on amazon ,  but elsewhere . 
i ve dropped my phone many many times ,  face down even ,  and not a scratch !  !  ! i love these cases !  !  !  . 
or certainly not last for a second repair . 
the feature that makes this phone great compared to the competition is the operating system . 
this crockpot is very sleek looking and a nice size . 
the handles on the size of the griddle take space on the stove . 
anyways ,  this phone case seems to prevent that sensor from working properly . 
nothing else protects as well ,  other than much more bulky cases . 
i have one in every car num_extend i own and my truck . 
this is the best foil cutter i ve used . 
it is also nice for the individual in the household who wants cream with coffee . 
i have this one for decaff ,  and the plain top for regular coffee beans . 
i used the recipe that came with it ,  and it hasn t failed me yet . 
i ve never heard better sound quality from any num_extend music player ,  and i ve owned quite a few of them . 
used properly ,  the knife should be drawn toward you during maintenance . 
this works great ,  plus you always have a usb cord to connect your phone to your computer . 
this press works well and i really like that i get more garlic out of each clove . 
when choosing a manual brewing method ,  it was down to french press ,  and chemex . 
the pan itself is very sturdy and has more heft than any nonstick pan i ve used before . 
i d like the fact that it has different temperature settings . 
also it is comming obviously with a screen protector . 
i did better then ok ,  we ate wonderfully with just a toaster oven and george foreman grill . 
i have also given them countless times as gifts . 
i got these in the mail not to long ago ,  there perfect . 
for cheap cutting boards ,  i love this material . 
perfect size . get it online like at amazon for a better price than at the store . 
i ve had a ton of cases for my iphone but these are my favorite . 
i haven t used this yet but have past experience with the brand . 
the cable i got from cellular num_num star works like a charm on my ipad num_extend
got it here for a little over $
in addition ,  it comes with a clear plastic protector so that the apple logo does not get scratched . 
works like a charm and with the casters it is very easy to move around the patio . 
now i wish i would hav bought it two years ago ! solid construction and it works like a charm . 
this might be the money talking ,  but the coffee taste better . 
so ,  if i fall out of love with it later ,  i ll come back and post an update . 
there are regular sim card adapters to put micro sim in . 
i had hoped the  wind noise  reduction technology would make for a great experience . 
i just learned how to can dry goods . 
it fits great and feels great in the hand too . 
he confirmed that this was a problem with the phone and that samsung is working on a maintenance update . 
i ve been using foodsaver s products for many years now . 
if the yogurt doesn t turn out ,  you are doing something wrong . 
it just feels cheap . overall ,  when you take the price into consideration this case is a great value . 
my music sounds a bit tinny even when i adjust the settings on the num_extend
i bought one for my mother in nz and alas she got a faulty probe . 
i bought this after a trip to italy where we used it in a cooking class to make gnocchi . 
i have been looking for a microwave popper for some time . 
what more is there to say ?  except to buy a spare . 
it s easier to read than the inside of a bottlecap . 
we purchased this jug for our milk and are so happy with it . 
you ll be surprised how delicious your steaks and burgers taste . 
you re beginning to understand the mythical power associated with exquisitely crafted knives like the japanese sword katana . 
it does indeed need at least num_num square foot of working space . 
i was happy how quickly this was deliverd . 
easy to rinse too ,  so why not ?  perfect . 
i have had this phone for over a year . 
one adjusts quickly ,  placing utensils business end downward in the rack . 
i like it better than my metal laof pans . 
i purchased this price for a great deal . 
looks like i m packing this cable away to keep it as a backup for the dexim . 
i chose the black color and it goes with all the appliances in my kitchen . 
i really like the grip material as it helps keep you steady on the downward press . 
like the water filter and adjustable brew size . 
the handles on the pot itself stay cool to the touch during cooking . 
the storage stand is cleverly designed and unobtrusive . 
ordered this for some extra storage in a workplace kitchen area . 
i ve been very careful in how i ve cleaned and stored this delicate probe . 
if you re like me ,  you have about eight  turners  or similar type of kitchen gadget in a drawer . 
this cover fits nicely and looks super nice . 
the best thing about these cups is their indestructibility . 
i have had this for almost a year  since it came out i quickly bought num_extend
now i can plug in my gps and charge my cell and bluetooth at the same time . 
in any event ,  i was not sure if i would like juicing or the clean up ,  etc . 
would you hand your kid a chef s knife to chop celery ?  don t be fooled by this tool . 
i m glad i went with the num_num shelf model . 
i fill it in the kitchen sink which is plenty big enough . 
i have pureed soups right in the cooker using an emersion blender and no problems . 
i am so glad that i bought these and saved so much money . 
the tpu case is perfect ,  fits with this dock too . 
it makes a fantastic shot ,  skinny vanilla latte ,  or caramel macchiato . 
a few runs down the sharpener and they cut things crisply . 
i have found it easy to use and the magnet is strong enough to leave it on the refrigerator . 
i haven t cooked with it ,  seasoned it or washed it yet . 
the small oxo spinner is also great for drying blueberries . 
it gets more of the juice from smaller or thin skinned lemons like  meyer  lemons . 
purchased two batteries ,  one for my phone and one for my wife s . 
i believed this pot set will last me at least num_num years . 
has some nice weight to it ,  which a man can appreciate . 
and the fact that it s a bagless and with no hepa made it even more attractive . 
it s much better than the old num_extend garlic press my mom gave me a long time ago . 
this comes in very handy for straining multiple cans of beans . 
what else should i say to satisfy the number of words required per review ?  . 
it fits right in my dishwasher and cleans up well . 
works well ,  good quality ,  i can use the bottom as a serving bowl . 
the color is a nice splash on the table . 
the product is smooth ,  however ,  and it almost slipped out of my hands several times . 
it looks kind of large but i can hardly feel it when i m wearing it . 
what can i say ?  the product works and hasn t broken yet . 
you will get up to num_extend cookies with this scooper and it makes great meatballs as well . 
got these along with the larger size  supercooler  . 
this book isn t much help if you are not taking the wilton cake decorating classes . 
also ,  if you will be grinding for espresso ,  keep in mind your espresso machine . 
i think the quality of . the battery is questionable . but it does outlast my original by a significant amount of time . 
if this is any example of build quality ,  then i can now only give this headset num_num stars overall . 
for a novice ,  it was easy to set up with the phone and get started . 
that one is pretty good too ,  but inferior to this one . 
it does not fall off my belt easily ,  as some other pouches have done . 
i can t tell how far along it is by how hard it is to turn either . 
the base jumps a little while grinding ,  but it isn t bad . 
the opener latches on well and turns with gentle pressure ,  smoothly and quickly . 
however ,  for a small room ,  the hamilton beach unit provides quiet ,  efficient air cleaning in a compact unit . 
and i ll be comparing this to the num_extend vs . 
it is the best purchase i have made for my kitchen ,  right after my kitchenaid mixer itself . 
it isn t perfect but it works just great . 
i told hubby he better not mess with me ;  . 
it is noisy ,  but sometimes the noise is a good thing !  !  i love it !  !  . 
i did not realize that to get the full sesame seed taste and aroma ,  they had to be grounded . 
hot tap water will be a poor substitute . 
the case is everything as described for the price paid . 
that was until i received a cast iron pizza pan . 
after years of microwave popcorn ,  i finally remembered why i liked popcorn . 
it shows that it can cook num_num slices but they get a bit cramped ,  still ,  it works well . 
even cake mix out of a box is a whole different cake ,  much better texture . 
this is what i wanted and the right price . 
i use them on the stove top ,  for things from the oven and even on my grill . 
after a mishap with one board ,  i quickly received a replacement and it is great . 
gives me options on grind by pulsing button . for flavors only available .  .  . if by press or filter brewers . 
unfortunately ,  music listeners will not get stereo bluetooth streaming because of the limited bandwidth of this system . 
i would estimate they hold num_num regular size shampoo bottles very nicely . 
if you re looking for a little extra added protection ,  check out otterbox defender line . 
i made rice in this pan at least num_num times and it turned out perfect . 
it has also stood up to the dishwasher rather well . 
wireless charging is one of those things you wouldn t expect to be as comforting as it actually is . 
when you are cleaning the tater you can see the difference between an uncleaned spot and a clean spot . 
for some reason there is dissention in the manufacturer s description if the concentrator disk is actually mandatory or not . 
i read lots of negative reviews but decided to get anyway . 
they are super easy on the hands and seems like they will last for many years . 
it s a little big ,  but good for the upcoming holidays . 
however ,  the sound quality seems to be below what is required for consistent use . 
the shield itself was in a hermetic transparent bag and has inperfections ,  lines all over protective filed surface . 
it cuts through things so easily that i barely have to move my hand for it to work . 
it is light enough for me to carry from room to room . 
now i don t have to worry about scratching up my iphone . 
i love that it s pink and it works perfectly !  it came on time and it wasn t damaged at all . 
generally ,  the micro usb is on newer phones . 
i love this product and have used it several times . 
the idea behind this product is excellent; the product itself ,  however ,  is far from perfect . 
overall ,  definately a healthy way to get some fiber in your diet . 
they have come off my cabinet a few times . 
i love that i am able to essentially grill indoors with this pan . 
better to just wash them by hand ,  which is why i didn t give it num_num stars . 
the cord is really long and is just what i wanted . 
it really is cute but it dont recommend for a long time use . 
boy was i glad i had num_num of them . 
but depending on your purpose ,  this might not be an issue . 
this one ,  however was a bit more of an investment for me but i haven t regretted it . 
something you can t do by just rinsing off your head of lettuce . 
it holds all our knives and i like the steak knife slots . 
the outside is a textured plastic shell which feels somewhat  soft  but not rubbery . 
the top and bottom of the container are rubber ,  so no slipping which i love . 
it pretty much fits the size and shape of every cell phone . 
basically ,  this means that they brew at the perfect temperature and do it consistently . 
i have nothing negative to say about this ,  and would buy again . 
i need more and would recommend them to any baker . 
filling it is a breeze as compared to others in dept stores . 
i m assuming this is because all these stones go through shipping and are bounced around before they get here . 
i had nothing to scrap my bowls with and was getting frustrated . 
change the cold water every day and it s perfect . 
this item arrived when promised ,  was well packaged and therefore undamaged . 
i am impressed with the versatility offered by these chargers . 
they are perfect for attaching to cabinets because anything with screws would be too damaging to the cabinet wall . 
this case is a higher quality plastic that doesn t feel cheap . 
my time spent baking has been cut so much . 
i used to have two ,  lost them ,  and replaced with this one ,  which is even better . 
i recommed this with num_num stars !  it s great !  !  . 
there s hardly any popcorn that doesn t pop in it . 
upon seeing it ,  i don t think that s a wise idea . 
it cuts anything ,  is really sharp ,  and has never needed sharpening . 
we registered and received num_num set of these knives for our wedding . 
it is stored and ready to serve when called upon . 
it has been a few months now and the case is holding up . 
once that gets to mixing ,  i put the plastic  splash  guard up and slowly pour in my dry ingredients . 
it was the same premise ,  but it didn t come with the mini usb or micro usb adapters . 
if there is a difference between this and an oem charger i can t tell . 
just wish someone would make a lid for this pan !  . 
we can get pet hair cought in it . 
cool retro gift for anyone who remembers the percolators of old . 
after all the reviews and paranoia about which size press to buy ,  i went with the four cup press . 
we have had an identical one for about num_num years and we find it excellent . 
if your super rugged on your phones ,  extreme sports ,  or constuction then maybe a tougher case might be applicable . 
you could literally cook chili for num_num in here ,  or soup for num_extend
they re reasonably easy to clean with a paper towel ,  and have lasted almost two years . 
there is quite a gap between the case and the headset plug . 
fits well and has protected the phone when dropped on tile floor . 
but perfect for pasta or any main course over rice . 
i use it daily with the powermat charger . 
and it came really fast in the mail . 
this made it quick and easy to replace the broken carafe . 
shaves about num_num minutes off the cook time . 
i have purchased a zagg screen for num_num different devices over the years . 
this is one of those ,  who would have thought this is useful items for me . 
you don t waste plastic bags and know what is in your cupboard instead of in your freezer . 
it s not super heavy ,  but not flimsy either . 
this vacuum was rated a consumer reports best buy ,  though i was skeptical . 
so wrong as to be absurd . this little plastic clamshell omelet gizmo works exactly as advertised . 
i bought these to cover up my stove that looked like it came out of a war . 
it s great for the laptop because it doesn t get tangle up in the bag . 
buy the three pack !  you need one for a trial and error . 
this tool of the professional will not wilt ,  shrink ,  warp or get hot . 
i like to mix bell pepper and onions in ground beef instead of using a large spoon . 
my old corkscrew of num_num year use fell on the floor and broke . 
i almost don t want to use it because of it s beauty . 
this was my first stereo bluetooth for music and it s ok with a few num_extend
delivery was prompt and product was as described . 
i beat it would easily crush number num_num limestone to dust . well made with simple but good ergonomics . 
the one it came with was very cheap . 
very well made product that will last for years . 
i will be buying the other sizes of this oxo item ,  and trashing all the others from my drawer . 
these have fairly short cutting edges and relatively longer handles . 
other than this issue it is a good product . 
i have a lot of loaf pans but this out does them all . 
now i use this product and am very happy with it . 
the unit uses a single volume button that toggles between num_num volume settings . 
it s not like any of those cheap silicon cases that you can get for couple bucks on ebay . 
i have been wanting one of these for sometime and finally broke down and spent the money . 
i wanted to listen to audio books and podcasts . 
it is simpy large enough to cover the handle and protect hands from burning . 
they fit to the screen perfectly and stick well . 
we got this pitcher as a wedding gift and we ve been using it now for over num_num years . 
if you re looking for a bluetooth headset look not further this is the right one for you . 
it sharpened well . bottom line :  this is a great knife and worth the money . 
works fine and they are a little thicker than the older flexible mats we were using . 
it offers basic protection ,  but is much more minimal than other cases . 
it made mincing garlic much easier and quicker . 
i haven t had it very long so it s a bit early to tell how well it holds it s edge . 
one of these will probably last longer than my headset ,  but that is good . 
mine came unbranded which i m glad since i don t actually use this cable for a blackberry . 
these cartridges can easily be swapped out in a variety of brita products . 
i read the size and the reviews but i didn t really understand how tiny this platter is . 
once used to it though  ,  i find it to be a superior virtual kb . 
wow ,  if you bake bread .  .  . this thing rocks !  i don t know why i waited so long to buy one . 
i m so glad i went back to this method of popping corn . 
it has performed admirably in all of these tasks . 
when you bake garlic in this it comes out like butter . 
i would recommend these to anyone who wants to remember an easier time . 
i would love to have this same mixer with a larger bowl . 
size wize ,  it s smaller than an internal num_extend computer hard drive . 
this is a great pan at a great price . 
i needed an extended case ,  and this one turned out to be an excellent choice . 
really good experience and very happy with the purchase . 
my kids love to watch the popcorn make !  !  the taste is also a lot better than microwave popcorn . 
while i had the phone ,  the rubber sheath protected it from a few falls . 
this sauce pan is just what i wanted . 
i originally had given this style of spinner a pass because i could not visualize it working . 
the thermometer probe can help ensure meat is cooked to the right temperature . 
with the kind of background noise i get ,  i couldn t use the jabra num_extend
these work very well and impressed my grandchildren . 
but ,  it works well enough when the electric one doesn t work for the can . 
the first one i lent my sister who used it to grind some cumin seeds . 
on and off with no problems and its not coming off until you flip the lever . 
we have used these in our toaster oven and they work great for a crispier pizza crust . 
this item is perfect for making a quiesadilla . 
it cooks faster than the teflon one i had . 
machine seems powerful as it has never stopped running while using it . 
the slicing and shredding blades are different as they are just flat discs without a dedicated stem . 
it is good quality and easy to hold . 
much better than my old shower curtain rings . 
i m looking for a new headset and there s nothing like this one . 
the twin usb ports allow me to charge two devices simultaneously . 
now if the space would be taller for a larger mug ,  it would be perfect . 
this product is amazing !  it came before it was expected and it is very cool . 
i ve never had my home churn go bad before it has been consumed  :   . 
it is worth every penny ,  considering how much i ve wasted on ones that don t work from other companies . 
it would be nice if it were backlit ,  but it isn t . problem two is the reflection . 
plus i can see it from my seat without picking it up . 
have hand washed it after reading other reviews of the markings wiping off . 
this measuring cup is really useful as most baking recipes require several cups of flour and often sugar . 
it was gray and old looking ,  but it was not warped and still worked great . 
one cannot expect the world for this price . 
you do not need to cover every crevice ,  just make sure to hit each quarter lightly . 
very clever ,  works well ,  and i love it !  . 
arrived ok and have been used many times already . 
i bought it when i got my htc sensation . 
my original carafe had an annoying leak that made coffee slowly dribble out below the rim when pouring . 
they feel solid ,  screw on easily ,  and seem to seal well for my purposes . 
i have used it in my car for several months without a problem . 
i like the color and the ease to remove it . 
i mean ,  you can t  feel  it with your fingers . 
it does strech a little but for the price it can t be beat . 
i appreciate the advise of keeping it in the freezer so you can make ice cream anytime . 
it s one quart ,  so it s good for measuring lots of liquid . 
i have never set anything up on bluetooth and so i wasn t quite sure how to do it . 
comes in retail package like they say also with instructions . 
the earpieces are mostly plastic ,  with soft imitation leather padding . 
i always wash them by hand and let them air dry . 
best eggs ever but pancakes and bacon do not cook even on this griddle . 
it works very well ,  fits like a glove and a lot less tha the apple product . 
and the deal was fast in the shipping and great price . 
it twists at the clip and clicks into different positions in num_num degrees . 
this is a sturdy and very effective grater . 
as much as he has traveled with it ,  it remains unbroken . 
its taste good and its good for you . 
i run honeywell filters in every major area of the house ,  and have been very happy with them . 
its great saving the counter space by not having a regular paper towel holder . 
i really love wireless stereo from my iphone . 
really like these durable white plastic lids for my jars . 
it is bpa free so i often store juice in it . 
green light means it is on ,  and it will flash blue when connected . 
whenever i am in need of a kitchen utensil ,  i usually look at the oxo brand first . 
wonderful for people like me who sweat a lot at night . brilliant and unexpected bonus !  !  . 
i plan on ordering iphone num_extend for me soon . 
this is by far the best charger i have owned . 
it has indicator lights letting you know it s on and when the charge is complete . 
for price and overall durability ,  the eco extreme is a keeper . 
and only num_num cards fit well in the case as bulky as it was . 
it is also wonderful for carving meats ,  with its long sharp blade . 
turned it on num_num hours ago and have left it on . 
these are very nice couplers for the larger decorating tips . 
the original droid was showing its age by giving us low memory messages . 
it is very small ,  and can be stored sitting up between num_num other kitchen devices . 
it seems as though i was always filling the hand soap dispenser . 
this was a gift and the person loved it . 
the size is easy to navigate while cleaning in the sink . 
it has gotten me through four turkeys ,  and an uncountable number of other large pieces of meat . 
instead ,  it lists all the features and expects you to put num_num and num_num together . 
be very careful to not get the liquid into the area around the button . 
heavier than store parchment and your spared the trouble of cutting a circle . 
i put them on my pies and the top crusts brown wonderfully without burning . 
it makes perfect  smashed  potatoes and any other root vegetables . 
in retrospect ,  maybe num_num stars is fair but amazon won t let me change it . 
came with instructions  not that it s that hard to put them on  ,  and they went on smoothly . 
i just wishi could fit more of them in there !  . 
but it s easy to take off the empty and insert the new one with little leakage on the floor . 
think of it as if you were to breathe on a mirror ,  that s the kind of moisture you ll see . 
you won t find a better case unless you want to spend a lot more money . 
so don t buy this if you have the regular samsung galaxy s ii ,  because it will not fit . 
when buying though ,  just be sure to check you have the right model . 
if i have to ,  i will report back . 
pretty much the rule with mdf is buy for temporary housing ,  and leave behind as it doesn t move well . 
i was hesitate at first because i was unsure of the size by the picture . 
it is phenomenal and i can recommend it as a professional tool that provides the best ironing results available . 
this works really well and is a great size for my needs . 
i have no problems with steam chatter or sweat sealing . 
item needed to be treated with mineral oil . 
my cakes so far ,  have come out of it perfectly . 
i bought these headphones looking for a cheap alternative for wireless bluetooth sound . 
for myself ,  i cannot afford  nor need  $ of japanese steel blades . 
i ve used it for steak ,  rice dishes ,  and even such mundane things as tuna helper and hamburger helper . 
i was shocked to see how fast the water came through . 
perfect fit for samsung galaxy s num_extend num_extend
it fits very well and all side buttons are accessible . 
very easy to pour sugar into smaller containers or measuring cups . 
never had a matte one before ,  and i kinda like it .  .  . it was a gift for my mom s new phone . 
although i have only had it for a month ,  i strongly believe i will enjoy it for many years . 
for most of my adult life ,  i wondered why anyone would spend hundreds of dollars on calphalon cookware . 
other than that ,  i m satisfied that i got a good product at a good value . 
this is necessary to let the air out but it also can blow bits of veggies around your kitchen . 
the part that plugs into the cigarette lighter is bent shaped . 
have not had any problems adjusting the grind to what i like  which is fairly fine  . 
so bottom line :  it looks great ,  performs well ,  is well made . 
well i found i could get two burners over it if i used one side of my stovetop ,  i . e . 
we put off buying a new pair of long tongs for years because of our bad experiences with them . 
i start using the phone when i get up at num_extend and i usually have power left at midnight . 
also youcsn not beat the great price here . 
it really is the perfect size and there are very few bread platters on the market . 
overall he is very pleased with it and i m pleased that he s handsfree !  . 
that could have been any number of things . 
only hitch is that it has a raised ridge around the entire perimeter that is a little rough . 
on the hoover ,  both the cleaning solution tank and the recovery tank are external . 
i put this fan in the window over the stove . 
a ton of baking goes on in our household and this bowl is a huge hit . 
the only thing that has scratched the film is my knife which i now carry in my other pocket . 
the phones that use this connection are older and simpler model phones . 
hopefully ,  this skillet will now be one of them . 
just don t expect high end . the microphone has good quality and sensitivity . 
after i used my mothers mixer i wanted one like hers . 
since i m asian ,  i love the tradition look and feel of this japanese knife . 
so it is great when preparing lunches for brown bag or picnics . 
recently i dropped my ipod touch on concrete and it cracked the screen . 
really . as for the quality and aesthetics ,  it s top notch . 
so far the extra battery time has been great . 
cost me a lot less then buying coffee products for the free loaders at work . 
some brands are charging more than twice as much just for a tpu case . 
i have a pipe dream that the right carpet cleaner will restore the nap . 
hopefully they won t sacrifice their advantages in attempt to be more like iphone . 
just popped our first batch after this beauty arrived from amazon . 
i would use them next time i need to order something . 
these are well made ,  do the job ,  and clean up nicely . 
lastly ,  it is less expensive than other cordless irons that i shopped for . 
fits easily on my head and very light which is perfect because i have a active job . 
this bluetooth works great !  clear sound and communication is clear as well . 
i leave it right next to the stove so i m not fumbling for a towel or pot holder . 
but again ,  i ve only used older android tablets . i love it . 
i like the red ,  it is harder to get them lost in the car . 
have used it for coffee and almonds ,  and spices ,  and never had any problems . 
i like it ,  and i use it occasionally . 
this can hold a substantial portion of chilli and probably the equivalent of two average bowls of cereal . 
i had a fixed thickness wire slicer that was fine ,  but this one works so much better . 
i have num_num of these in the bathroom . 
it has not given me any problems ,  and is really pretty easy to clean as well . 
screw top on firmly ,  avoid using handle to tighten as it has broken for some num_extend
if you ve got ridges or bumps ,  it s not going to be able to seal to it . 
i was skeptical at first but this works very well . 
batteries and charger num_num stars ,  kid num_num stars . 
i imagined my grandmother making bacon and eggs in a pan like this . 
the only thing i would like to see is an optional electric pump to go with this bottle sealer . 
works better than almost any other brand you would use out there . 
total peace of mind and connection to the outside world . 
i wish i could use them ,  but will end up giving them to someone with larger ear canals . 
there is an indicator light which turns green when the phone is on and red when turned off . 
i ve used it daily since and no problems . 
i ve been using the plantronics num_extend since that model came out quite a few years ago . 
works just as good as battery that came with ohone . 
there are tons of apps and widgets in the android market . 
it s extremely tough and it reaches anywhere i need it to . 
the dirt cup is easy to remove ,  empty ,  and replace . 
one little feature that really impressed me was the ability to display the screen vertically  it s longer that way  . 
still ,  i liked it while it lasted ,  and for the price ,  i think it did great . 
not having used pressure cooker before appreciated the warnings and useful tips on how to use safely . 
when you set up the drier ,  just add a couple . 
i think i paid about num_num dollars for it ,  and i made a free shipping order . 
i miss that phone just thinking about it . 
the handle is solid and a good weight . 
thought it would b bad but the condition was descent . 
you ll pass this one on to your grandchildren . 
have even used these to can with !  love them !   :   . 
some reviewers complain that the inserts can only be oused once . 
i have small ears and couldn t find a bluetooth that fit . 
very happy with the product and the delivery . 
i expected the parts to lock into place better ,  but i have not experienced any problems as a result . 
this pan has become my workhorse from breakfast to dinner . 
delivery was almost overnight with the  good guys  who i have already positively raved about . 
i m not sure how this compares to other garlic presses though ,  so it could be num_extend
the lid is not dishwasher safe ,  owing to the components on the inside you don t want to damage . 
afterwards i drained it ,  scrubbed it with a stiff brush ,  dried it and warmed it on the stove . 
now the pot works great obviously the chip doesn t hurt its performance . 
this stick vac does an amazing job of picking up hair and pet dander . 
i am back in the us and the phone still works great . 
the pulps are very very dry which means all the liquid are extracted . 
before the wok arrived ,  i already received email on how to season the wok . 
i also use them inside because of three busy ,  jumping kitties . 
i don t see it being obstrusive at all at a buffet table or on the dinner table during convo s . 
then i just use the paper towel to spread the oil very thinly . 
this is all you need for cooking and home protection . 
i m so pleased to find these little bags since plenty of things are better suited for small packages . 
it is quite big !  don t just use the picture ,  think about what num_num quarts looks like before buying . 
also has a carbon water filter to make coffee taste great . 
i got this one for my mom on mother s day and amazon shipped it out quick . 
and honestly ,  i really cannot recommend anything else . 
fireworks popcorn is the best popcorn to pop in it !  !  . 
this came with a carrying case and it looked very impressive . 
i was raised with one from the num_extend
i ve had very few complaints from others about hearing me . 
i ve used this dish for pot pies and au gratins ,  and it s wonderful for both . 
you already know that this knife is unlike any other you ve seen . 
it has a  warm  setting ,  which is handy . 
i use metal utensils with them and so far ,  no scratches ,  no problems whatsoever . 
my only complaint is that it s bigger than necessary . 
buy the meat grinder attachment ,  and you can prepare your own groud beef and sausage . 
i have not tried to tell it to call brother; yet . 
they wash well in the dishwasher and like i said ,  bake phenomenally . 
this charger is amazing ,  but if you want a charger that holds even more ,  go for the icarrier . 
the cake slices neatly ,  producing slices that look pretty on the plate . 
i like these knives in the kitchen as they have fairly sharp ,  thin blades . 
i almost returned the headset because i could not get rid of it . 
when i went to strain them ,  the weight of num_num qts . 
this is a wonderful set for basic cake decorating ,  pretty much everything you need . 
now that i have experienced this knife ,  i m looking at my j . a . 
while i didn t need this much .  .  . it s useful around the kitchen and house . 
i ve had no problems with it ,  it s a workhorse . 
thought they would actually seal but they seam to be doing the job without the air tight seal . 
this battery pack has served me well many times . 
the pancakes you can make with these rings are almost too cute to eat !  and ,  too easy to use . 
my steamer basket fits perfectly in the bottom . 
there s a reason why corelle is the gold standard for dinnerware . 
they d fold over sometimes and there d be grounds in my coffee . 
if you re looking for a great paring knife ,  this is it . 
i definitely notice a difference when its time to be replaced . 
however i did condition this after marked and was blown away . 
if you never had a headset speak the settings and power level then you re missing out . 
it s an aesthetic thing really . but i really do love my knives and the weight of them and everything . 
the stone crock and glass lid is dishwasher safe and actually fits in the dishwasher . 
and so ,  then ,  wouldn t lie flat at its edges . 
it s light weight ,  but does a fine job . 
the handle portion unlocks and leans just like on a vacuum ,  making it easy to navigate around . 
we love the fast pumping action and the quick brake stop feature . 
it don t even try to charge my phone any more ,  but rely on this charger to keep me powered . 
they are always falling out of my ears because the buds are always too big for my ears . 
it shuts off then goes back on then shuts off repeatedly . 
the ability to mount it on the windshield it ac vent is great and both worked well . 
this is the second one that i ve had because of such an issue . 
my only complaint with this small appliance has been the static that s produced any time i use the mill . 
i love the option to transmit music num_extend
i used it several times and when im done i just put in my van door for next time . 
we bought it because our krups started making lousy coffee and then ,  one day ,  i broke the carafe . 
i use this almost exclusively to bake bread . 
pull cord ones get tangled or rotted cords . 
the is a handy little brush that gets into the crevices for sweeping out the coffee grinds . 
i use it for packets of sweeteners but i m thinking of ordering a second one just for tea bags .

when it arrived i was disappointed the documentation and  how to use  info was not more complete . 
carrying them is light weight and clean up is a breaze !  . 
when you open the iron there are two self tapping screws on each side near the hinge . 
it is small enough to fit in a closet underneath my blouses . 
love the new color !  i only use fiesta ware dinnerware !  . 
it is heavy and therefore i assume durable . 
house is bought and rack is up with lovley calphalon pots and pans glistening from the ceiling .

this dryer rack is practically cheap and serves well for its use . 
i bought this charger to use ,  specifically ,  with my nexus s num_extend

youl have to take the phone out of its case before you can use these items . 
it is still shiny ,  and looks relatively unworn . 
i bought this as a replacement for a much cheaper unit which i gave to a friend . 
like all whisks can be difficult to wash . 
no great strength is required as with other models ,  just the ability to turn the handle . 
you will need the extended battery cover for the motorola bionic because it is thicker than the standard battery . 
my initial thought was that it had slipped its mooring but it actually broke .

i feel these give me the best of several different ways of using the bluetooth stereo . 
the stuff is heavy gauge ,  thick ,  yet flexible . 
the num_extend was braun  given as a gift  and that poor baby didn t even last after num_num months . 
they are nice to use ,  balanced i suppose ,  and the rubber grip helps too . 
i started with the pre made bags so was unsure about the rolls . 
i only wish i d bought these when the num_num for num_num offer was available !  . 
note that this is not an ear bud ,  like most of the bluetooth headsets i ve seen . 
i disagree completely with the reviewer that says it has a hard time opening small cans . 
never worried about runninig out of batteries while i have this on me !  charges quickly . 
sits level in my sink ,  and the feet are sturdy . 
big enough for bigger than average irons ,  holds the ironing board fine . 
too long though for me i might take it or modify it . 
it wouldn t be untrue for me to say that the kitchen is my least favorite room in the house . 
we don t have a grand chef s kitchen operation running at our house and for us ,  these are great . 
i picked this tip up inmiss vickie s big book of pressure cooker recipes . 
i ve had several bluetooths and a few wanna be bluetooths ,  but this motorola is by far the best . 
this one will take some time to season ,  but it s a nice ,  thick ,  high quality replacement . 
i like to put a little cheese on top while frying and it does a great job . 
be careful with the plastic clip ,  as is you re hard on your belongings ,  be extra careful with this one . 
i bought this beautiful and stylish ice bucket for my home ,  but it would make a lovely wedding gift . 
my husband and i made our first batch of venison sausage and it was easy and delicious . 
a spare charging cord is always a good idea ,  and this is a bargain . 
coffee and getting tired of the burned coffee taste from any coffee not consumed soon after brewing . 
when the pastry starts to stick i just scrape it up and dust a little flour under it . 
other than that though ,  it s an excellent buy for the price ,  and my tea has never been better . 
so ,  this num_num cup holds more and does the same excellent job of separating the fat from the stock . 
the music control buttons may not work for all phones . 
once you have one ,  you can t go back . 
it s easy to use ,  compact and it comes in black which matches my kitchen wonderfully . 
if they are crappy they will strip the screws . 
bought a few of these for the usb charger portion . 
i thought the phone was outof warranty ,  but on calling nokiausa to see about getting it repaired ,  it wasn t . 
the only difficulty i had was learning how to snap the bottom and top parts correctly into place . 
but i would be interested in a pancake maker along the same lines . 
it is a little larger than i thought ,  but that s actually a good thing . 
you ll never have to worry about the metal handles ever coming loose . 
i haven t tried it with my cell phone but its bars went up ,  too . 
when mine arrived by ups ,  the lid was rattling around and i thought right away ,  oh well ,  it s gone . 
a great deal !  again ,  i wish i could exchange it for a case to my num_extend
for the price i don t think there is a better case on the market . 
i had to have this device because of the dual keypadding operation . 
it works well ,  but you loose the availability of the other outlet . 
so i can t tell you if they will hold up in the dishwasher . 
if your device uses usb power to recharge . 
for what you get ,  it is a little expensive . 
i have not received full refund yet from vendor . 
sorry you need to heat the water before you put into it . 
the picture showed num_num and the description didn t state how many were actually included . 
took forever to get here from browne food service itself . 
oh this little machine ,  i love it so much . 
we can get by with the smaller unit and it s a heck of a lot easier to store . 
you guessed it ,  the pans still brown as evenly and clean up as easily as before . 
the phone inductively charges fast ,  probably just as fast as using the microusb . 
mine is set a couple notches up from the lowest setting and it is the perfect sound for me . 
maybe she ll even use it to cook something !  . 
i do find the glass to be a bit unwieldy . 
it doesn t take up much space and does exactly what it should . 
makes me miss my evo num_extend a little less  :  thanks for reading .  .  . again !  . 
i have other wusthof classic knives and they are high quality . 
not to mention that my rueben now comes out perfect . 
the only downside is recharging through a usb . 
i bought this and ruined the first num_num by getting dust under them . 
nothing sticks and clean up is a breeze . 
this adaptor fit my num_num gallon porter cable shop vac hose and extensions perfectly . 
they did a good job and are very inexpensive . 
same with veggies ,  which do not seem to get soggy . 
most users will want to use an ac wall charger with a usb cable . 
while cleaning up after meals ,  i find myself smiling at how effective this little device is . 
it moves air around just fine ,  though it is somewhat noisy because its a box fan . 
it was blue with a white ring around the bristles . 
some people ask me why my reviews are ranked so high . 
it has been working so well for many years now . 
offers interchangeable covers ,  so you should be able to get a nice fit for your ear . 
when i opened the door to get out ,  the phone fell a good num_num feet down onto blacktop . 
this is a great knife for those intermediate chefs . 
not the cheap kind i was expecting and find in local stores . 
make sure that you double check the size of these . 
used to have a similar model that we gave away to our daughter a few years ago . 
two of out num_num of them work just fine ,  but for some reason one of them didn t work . 
perfect headset for the road and the price is worth it . 
it works with many products to send your music via bluetooth . 
the other parts seem more sturdy too but the pot handle is still fragile . 
the container is easy to clean in the dishwasher . 
this pan is gorgeous ,  if a pot can be gorgeous . 
the only caveat to this is that it only appears to work when you re talking . 
this was square ended and a fairly tight fit into the grove . 
they worked fine on my num_extend ipad mini and my iphone . 
this is classic white ,  just the right size for utensils and i love it because it is so handy . 
i have this headset connected to my macbook pro and iphone . 
i don t give a rat s patootie for gourmet snobbery . 
it fits the hand well and is easy to use and clean . 
i have all the colors available for this phone . 
it is pretty heavy and it looks nice ,  i bought the num_num peice set . 
you could not see the kale or carrots . 
i have tried many different spinners over the years and this by far has been the best one . 
we have cooked takikomi gohan in this rice cooker and it also came out great . 
i couldn t believe how much hair and stuff came off a seemingly clean carpet . highly recommended . 
i always felt a little uncertain when attacking stains like this with a towel or sponge . 
hopefully with next updates there will be support for more languages . 
my pork loin was still really warm and the soup was warn but not as much . 
in addition ,  the food needs to stay at temperature . 
wine server looks great and ends the drips !  what a great hostess gift for the price . 
you use plate num_num and num_num together if you have a devie only with innocel extended life battery installed . 
not a single thing that i am not happy with . 
these aren t large glasses ,  just the right size in my opinion for a bit of scotch . 
don t worry ,  we are only talking millimeters here ,  but i was originally expecting it to just  sit on  . 
there is little to clean afterwards as a simple rinse does the trick . 
the sound is great ,  i love the voice commands and i listen to music sometimes as well . i love it . 
it s compact and built rather well ,  imho . however ,  the poor battery life was quite surprising . 
so i thought i would give it a try . 
that one quit working num_num days after i got it . 
i had my daughter buy a pair of the smaller size and we traded . 
you should also know that this headset can only be worn on the right num_extend
great price well made ,  very cool external charger . 
a buddy has one that is probably a num_extend or num_extend model and it still works fine . 
the kids love to push this handle down . 
i am very happy with these pans ,  they are very sturdy and thick . 
i made an indian dish tonight that called for a grater such as this . 
also ,  the headphone jack cover has torn slightly ,  but it s not something that is that big of a deal . 
ideally ,  try before you buy . the switch on the left lets you turn the power on or off . 
not only are our carpets cleaner than clean ,  all of our surfaces are spotless . 
and unlike other gadgets ,  this gets used at least num_num times a week . 
i almost forgot that part !  there is nothing remarkable  or disappointing  about the call quality . 
the trick is to soak the container and to place the dish in a cold oven . 
my wife and i use it all the time . 
i purchased a couple other peelers during my quest and i was very disappointed . 
the handle is available online for something like $ so if it ever breaks again ,  i m not too worried . 
much bigger than i expected ,  but it is wonderful for carving large cuts of meat or whole turkey . 
i bought the num_extend fry pan and the num_num qt . 
they are in ear with extra sizing gels for your comfort . 
my only disagreement with nina s review is a minor one :  i don t object to the mill s looks . 
this makes it much more easier to fit the guard screen perfectly over the face of the phone . 
i got it on sale for a little more than num_num dollars and it was a steal . 
planned on cupcakes on the side at our daughter s wedding . 
it is perfect for steaming veggies and also for steaming dim sum  delicious !   or whatever your heart desires . 
it really is a quality case for that price . 
if the mandoline blades weren t sharp ,  it wouldn t work and consumers would be dissatisfied with the product . 
i think for the money it is a good product . 
and nothing is worse than biting into a raw piece of potato . 
the door also gets hot but not as hot as the top  the door is insulated  . 
on my end ,  the voices came through clear and loud . 
i was very pleased with them always have . 
i was really surprised at how easily this knife cut food . 
i selected this unit due to the low cost . 
with a spray of canola oil in each cup ,  they came out easily and perfectly shaped . 
it s not like other phone cases where it s kinda difficult to snap the pieces together . 
my wife was craving cheese fondue so i shopped around and decided on this one . 
all one needed is paiance and to follow the youtube videos on line . 
i purchased the silver unit to go with my new harmon kardon soundsticks . 
then flip ,  turn off the heat ,  and cover for num_num minutes . 
i like the ease of connectivity for bluetooth . 
my husband had to use crazy glue instead because the screen kept popping out . 
the construction of the case was excellent and provided a ultimate overall protection . 
during a frantic holiday baking exercise  my wife making treats for friends  ,  our wire whip got misplaced . 
i use it more than this hot air popper because it pops a serving size that suits my needs . 
so i can use bt when sitting at my desk . 
i have the napkin holder ,  the paper towel holder ,  the spice rack and i needed something for my fruits . 
i researched this teakettle for several days prior to buying it . 
this pitcher has turned out to be better than the reviews i read . 
at num_extend with autofocus ,  i would say this might nearly pass as a digital camera replacement . 
these units do a very good job of cleaning the air . 
the recipes in the book are wonderful ,  so i would recommend following them for getting perfect results . 
i really like them and they complete my set of stainless measuring cups . 
it makes my iphone easy to spot when searching for it at my home . 
i ve tried other fm transmitters and they didn t do as well as the jabra . 
now the set is here ,  i have to say that it was packaged very well . 
i get that level of compatibility with my num_extend
the headset simply beeps in my ear ,  and i click it to take the call . 
plug also works as usb charger for other devices  with usb charging cables  i . e . 
i really like the convenience of the case . 
i looked at the otterbox choices ,  but in the end i m glad i got the griffin ones . 
i always sort of though a stylus was a waste . 
the mirror is great ,  love the clock ,  but the light will not stay on ,  so don t count on that . 
the plantronics backbeat num_num headset has some real advantages for the listener and they are comfortable in many ways . 
battery was at a good price that i bought num_num for the other replenishphones that i have . 
that can be awkward for the turning process and placement of the bowl . 
i am very happy with these drawer dividers . 
i can probably purchase different sized ones ,  but it really hasn t become an issue yet . 
i was hesitant to purchase another since a lot of my processing was done by water bath these days . 
this stuff is so good ,  can t believe it . 
i can t believe i waited this long to get my own kitchen aid mixer . 
protects well the phone and the front screen . 
there s not that much to say ,  is there ?  this dough blender works perfectly . 
we ve been avid campers for over num_num years ,  but never really got into cast iron because of the weight . 
we were looking for something easy to use ,  with dials instead of digital . 
one of the best purchases on the amazon site so far . 
but i didn t really understand until i got another bread maker which has all the bells and wistles . 
it also looks very firm and strong ,  and its the right size for me . 
of course ,  it s great for other clothes too and my drapes never looked better . 
i liked the other one because it was small and just fit in my kitchen draws . 
this makes it easier to install and set up straight . 
i have been using this product for about a year now . 
to my satisfaction each popped kernel was big ,  fluffy and flavorful . 
the pen will be very easy to lose ,  as it has no way to attach it to my iphone . 
knives are in full view ,  so you can pick the right one the first time . 
i should weigh it ,  because it has to weigh at least num_extend
my mom bought the same vac about same time from q and had same issue . 
the gadget separates the fruit from the rind and removes the core with each turn . 
it spreads easily with a pastry brush ,  keeps cake from sticking ,  and there s no sticky residue . 
we have always used handheld mixers and when they died we would just buy another but were never happy . 
a little bulky compared tp other camera phones like num_extend
the num_num inch really is perfect for my family of num_extend
i find this item fantastic for serving home made cakes when having firends for dinner . 
was just what i thought it would be . 
this is a cool item for the fun hearted cook . 
i realize how absurd it is do get so excited over a cell phone charger . 
just remember when you get them that there are two sides to these protectors ,  and you ll be fine . 
long drives and use my phone tremendously ,  gps ,  emails ,  package tracking and so one .  . thanks a mil . 
this breadmaker is perfect for making those loaves to share among our num_num person family . 
i purchased this saucepan so that i can start making homemade marshmallows ,  hot fudge sauce ,  and caramel sauce . 
i ordered num_num for my phone and will order more if needed in the future . 
you can also use the single button but the taps take less concentration for me . 
being big isn t so much a problem as the machine sits on swivel base making access easy . 
it s far superior to any other electric kettle i have ever owned . 
i just left this pot to boiling with potatoes in it and forgot about it for too long . 
this would also make a great knife for cutting baguettes for service . 
i believe it s about num_extend thick and probably weighs over num_num lbs . 
this is my third external charger and it is definitely the best . 
i m so glad i purchased it plus it has a num_num year warranty !  . 
i needed a new spatula to use in the kitchen . 
we have four different kinds of kitchen scissors . 
with this fine mesh strainer you can fry bacon and then save the grease for frying eggs or whatever . 
i have both the num_extend and the num_extend
i was looking for a case that was functional as well allowed me to use my phone . 
love the simple pattern on the front and back . 
i love otterbox products and this one is no exception . 
for the money ,  i think it is one terrific little mixer !  the num_extend does not splatter . 
a full pot made two and a half good size cups of coffee . 
each shape when cut is will fit with room to spare on a ritz cracker . 
they make quick work of trimming fat from foods . 
this works so much better than using a flat baking sheet for making french bread . 
it is worth the somewhat higher price ,  no questions asked . 
they are heavier which is nice and again ,  look great !  . 
this looks like the classic candy thermometers from when i was a kid . 
this is an excellent hands free device to use in the car or anywhere you need them . 
kind of strange since it states the size in the product description here . 
i am told it worked for another year after it was put on . 
we narrowed it down to either cast iron or stainless steel . 
this one didn t split when i cranked down on it . 
i ve only been using it for about a week now . 
this kit contains the basics for every kitchen :  chef s knife ,  medium knife  vegetables  and a carving knife . 
my unit also included the gold tone filter which eliminates the need for paper filters . 
it has the two qualities that all cooks demand :  it s easy to clean and it s durable . 
if you have an old phone or pi ,  this is a great choice . 
the whole thing is quite heavy empty actually . 
i have a stainless steel sink and this looks good and the suction cups adhere well . 
i love corelle ,  they always make quality products that last a long time . 
so far we ve used it on apples ,  pears and potatoes . 
i wish that the handles were deeper or perhaps had folding handles . 
as an avid cook ,  i try to upgrade my small appliances when they have served me well . 
boy ,  these protectors couldn t have arrived at a better time . 
we get this message saying shortcut not available on this phone . 
holds razor in place firmly on our tiled shower . 
they seem to disappear on their own ! at any rate ,  i recommend these guards . 
so i dumped the hose several times for warmer water . 
i like the way it cooks food ,  it is easy to clean and i have used it often . 
i weighed exactly num_extend lbs more than when i wasn t holding the dumbells . 
creamer gets thick and yummy when it s frothed ,  btw . 
popped out the old batter and put this one in its place . 
the price was good at under twenty dollars . 
i had one for me num_extend num_extend  ,  htc one v . 
add a filter to the chemex  multiple layered side toward the spout  ,  prewetting it with some tap num_extend
this unit lends itself well to simple cleanups . 
this can be tiring and sometimes ,  depending on what you are doing ,  a bit awkward . 
just don t let it sit too long in hot skillet or you may ruin the edge . 
we actually made garlic powder from the dried garlic and wow is that ever wonderful . 
the cutter would slip out of the groove and leave uncut spots along the rim sometimes . 
and the bright red color blends well with my other le creuset spatulas . 
the rods were so warped that they wouldn t go through the holes . 
perhaps kitchenaid was having problems at one time in the past . 
i don t know how i could ever go back to living without it . 
i ve got decent manual dexterity ,  but i found that this install was very difficult . 
have made num_num or num_num meals in it since i received it . 
plus ,  it s  so far  survived numerous trips in the dishwasher . 
so far i ve made a couple batches of carpacio and of beef jerky ,  and it s worked great . 
a vast improvement over an old crazed saucer ! flo philips . 
the power button on it didn t line up properly . 
we all know the obvious flaw and the most annoying one is the battery life . 
this works well to extend the battery life between charges of your iphone . 
if that did it automatically ,  it would be perfect . 
do this with all your vacuum s and they will then perform as anyone would expect . 
by christmas it ll have much more use and i suspect a better rating . will change it after longer use . 
they do cut down on the night allergies . 
will be replacing all my old glass this year !  love this product . 
simply tapping the dust with the tape should be enough to remove it . 
i realize that a lot of people say that will ruin my knives but i really don t care . 
no complaints from folks on the other end . 
this simple trick ensures that you are heard clearly . 
the quality is great and none have ever failed . 
i cannot say enough good things about this little gem of a grater . 
the first was a workhorse that lasted almost thirty years . 
i use it to grate hard parmesan cheese and then refrigerate the remaining cheese in the grater . 
the foreman grill never really resulted in anything that was much better than microwaving . 
with my other case ,  i feel my phone is a little more safe . 
this is a great product ,  and i just wish there were more color options . enjoy !  . 
more expensive than the plastic models but this is far superior than the cheaper ones in every way . 
removing the lcd is tricky ,  but maybe i was just playing it too num_extend
this set is the perfect one for baking !  i would definitely recommend this set !  . 
i had one before but don t know what happened to it .  .  .  .  .  . maybe i gave it away by mistake . 
it s large enough that i can make burgers for the whole family at one time . 
i just make sure that the batteries are pretty much toast before i charge them up . 
it has gotten wine out of dresses ,  carpet ,  you name it . 
being that the mug s interior is plastic ,  you will initially get that yucky plastic smell . 
been going to get one and just put it off for a long time . 
she still has it and it works well . 
it spans spring and summer ,  no problem ,  so it is versatile . 
it was always too much work to roll out the dough ,  before . 
they are great no more toughing and taring the shower curtain . 
this case is great !  it provides great protection ,  access to the ports ,  and looks good doing so . 
i did ,  however ,  expect it to have been made in the usa since it s a lodge product . 
i boil my water ,  throw in my leafs and strain out my tea . 
you won t get the brown cake bottom or anything stuck to the pan . 
best purchase i have ever made for my kitchen hands down . 
it s comfortable and really does a great job of noise canceling . 
i am glad i tried it because it is now a staple in my kitchen . 
this is extremely sharp ,  i took off several layers of skin and i felt was a bump . 
this caddy does exactly what i need it to do . 
i am not sure what more can be said . 
since ,  i have an aversion to using a knife . 
i think all the hard floor kit allows it to do a better job of drying the floor . 
the meat is very tender ,  but doesn t disintegrate . 
i only use powdered sugar on top of the castle cake . 
but neither can anyone else !  !  !  so it works really well . 
this thing is strudy and has an airtight seal . 
i purchased this kettle two years ago for $ here on amazon and have used it almost every day . 
the fit is also nice when just sing the stock battery . 
for some reason i have never bought anything else . 
i gave up waiting for windows phone num_extend
the usb cord is working well with my phone . 
i love being able to make the bath deeper with this gadget . 
i like the way it looks so much that i leave it out on my counter . 
at under ten bucks ,  it s a great deal . 
i m not a coffee drinker ,  but my wife is . 
i purchased this on sale to have an external charger that could charge my ipad . 
this griddle is nice and heavy ,  the surface is perfect . 
this is a great product and does exactly as it says it does . 
easy to refill and i never have problems with the filler opening up while i am grinding . 
the wi fi worked perfectly ,  the volume was perfect . 
dry on the stove with heat for a few minutes . 
fast too and i like the waterproof feature . 
after my first try ,  i got the knack of it and am pleased with the results . 
they arent solid colors as much in person like they appear on the site . 
if you intend it to round out your kitchen utensil collection ,  then it is great !  . 
definitely worth a look if you need a case of this type . 
at the moment there is no video chat software available . 
she loves it and had to have one too when she saw me using mine in my suv . 
easy to clean and the lids fit easily without any struggle . 
when i drilled the holes very slightly larger everything worked and it still seems really solid . 
so right away i put this battery to the test . 
we have sprint ,  so that should say why we don t have a huge boost in signal . 
the accuracy of this num_num piece set of measuring cups is excellent  vs . 
the suction is great and the hoover cleaning solutions perform better than any others i ve tried . 
it is sturdy ,  if the suction plate is properly sealed so it does not move . 
the skimmer is also very useful for soups to take out chicken or any other meat . 
i could of become a chef ,  but i don t like the hours involved . 
the ability to stream music and audio from your mobile with the calls is great . 
the hoover handles both ,  my rug looks fresh and new each time i vacuum . 
i ve run it through the machine a few times and it came out clean and without any issues . 
this is my num_extend one in as many months ,  and it s just for one iphone num_extend
i did some research online and found mostly mixed reviews . 
i owned this phone for about a year and loved it . 
i ve had one of these for years and i would not live without it . 
i am even happier because now i get the smaller one to myself ,  to make normal home baked goods . 
it has a clear screen protector that does not interfere with the touch screen . 
i d give this num_num stars if it truly made num_num cups . 
i use them as light dish towels ,  cleaning and polishing cloths ,  etc . 
it has a couple of minor quirks that annoyed me at first until i got used to them . 
i thought these would add a personal touch and they did not disappoint . more like understated elegance . 
i have the blueair num_num and have to say it has been a godsend . 
full charge with the ac adapter takes num_num hours ,  the usb cable takes num_num hours . 
i was surprised to discover than my mac s usb port also doesn t charge my phone very quickly either . 
i can charge my phone and friends  phones from my backpack in the middle of class . 
i read the instructions ,  where i often do not ,  because i have a lot of respect for sharp blades . 
it is a great case for the iphone num_extend and ,  in my opinion ,  worth more than the price . 
it goes in the garbage with the ruined meal . this particular design is a perennial for many reasons . 
it is of a hard type plastic and slick so it is easy to clean . 
and the best thing is it doesn t take up any space on my counter . 
i would highly recommend this item to anyone who wants a quick and easy  power broom  . 
it s a bit noisy ,  but i read the other reviews and knew that when i bought it . 
great price ,  excellent protection and the thing fits perfectly without being super bulky . 
the bialetti is made out of aluminum ,  and coffee is ready in num_num to num_num minutes . 
with bananas thrown into the most basic aunt jemima mix ,  i found the waffles required a bit more time . 
i remember as a child ,  my father ,  who was a chemical research scientist ,  installed the whole house culligan system . 
i have yet to find something i cannot cook perfectly in addtion to panini sandwiches . 
i actually don t use this phone anymore ,  but i still have it . 
find a better one that meets all those criteria  if you can  . 
i took it off the charger about num_num pm that night . 
it is slide to fit the iphone perfectly . 
also some friends who know i bake have been giving me cake decorating gifts  so sweet !   . 
what else can you ask of a soup bowl ?  . 
i can t give it num_extend because the cords it came with are a bit unreliable . 
a good alternative to the fancy high dollar ones . 
it is so much better than the microwave popcorn . 
that makes it hard to store ,  so it s best if you have space to leave it on the counter . 
this mixing bowl has a good grip on the side perfect for whipping ingredients and is extremely sturdy . 
i cut on it pretty much every day and it does not seem to dull my knifes at all . 
my cakes have all come out of this pan easily and the markings have been beautiful . 
it quickly installed and updated and walked through driver installation on xp . 
i ve enjoyed cake decorating over the years and now my daughter is getting into it as well . 
now i forbid my mum from touching this pan ,  and she regret ever since . 
but if you re particular about your coffee grind ,  save up for a burr type grinder . 
in fact ,  i already have and my friend did buy one . 
have had a few ladies at work order them as well . 
this is large enough to accomodate six large boneless chicken breasts that are butterflied . 
the clean up is fairly easy ,  recommend using dawn dish soap works great . 
first ,  let me say that i don t have a problem with the sharp corners; i want them that way . 
i ve tried the recipes in the book and also made gluten free cones with great success . 
i had issues with that before and was relieved to see that it fit . 
each shelf is rated to hold num_num pounds and i can easily believe this is accurate . 
you ll need : a bowl for mixing and a spoon . salts . 
it isn t a big deal but when i cook certain items ,  the angle is a bit annoying for flipping . 
it is very sturdy and easy to clean . 
are we pros at scooping ?  i d say so . 
will still melt away in your pasta or risotto with ease . 
i tried this file in my old curve num_num and it worked flawlessly . 
i never thought i needed this kind of cooking tool . 
it really adds to the overall effect !  great buy !  . 
even a light spray of flavored oil on your salad or pasta is a pleasant change . 
can t go wrong in the kitchen with this brand . 
i don t think you ll be disappointed if you buy this . 
it was the perfect size for my daughter s samsung phone . 
i do use dish soap on my cast iron from time to time . 
i have exactly two bottles ,  a bar of soap ,  and a razor . 
very good quality and has been protecting my a while now . 
the illuminated keyboard seems to be the exact same size of a bold s ,  only it becomes available when needed . 
i wish i could say such about most of the products i buy . 
the material is easy to clean and has a secure feeling to it when holding a handle . 
i will post my results if they turn out !  . 
i finally stopped wasting my time and money ,  and bought this one again . 
a friend had her home remodeled forcing her to take her family s laundry to laundrymat . 
but this thing rocks !  we microwaved half a mug of milk for about a minute ,  reaching num_extend
i have a samsung num_extend with an outter box case . 
but i have to say that i was very pleased with it . 
after lots of experience discovered that you get the best results if you gently rotate the grinder while grinding . 
the lid is well designed and is very easy to pour  better than the old one  . 
the lid is constructed very well and fits tightly . 
i make my own yoghurt and this was a boon . 
unlike most single ear headsets ,  this one allows you to pause and restart audio . 
all buttons are easily accessible and you do not have to worry about the headphone jack . 
super easy ,  looks exactly like the picture ,  stainless steel so it stays looking nice . 
the only reason i did not give this num_num stars is the holder . 
this one has all the in between measurements and clip on and off the ring easily . 
it even performs beautifully in the oven  try skillet cornbread  . 
this amazon price is a great value given the quality of the pan . 
the new trent battery then indicated it had minimal power . 
it has active noise cancellation that blocks out some of the background noise . 
the reviews on this were so varied that i hesitated to buy it . 
but it is proving to me a good investment . 
other than that ,  the price is the biggest con . 
it does not leak at all ,  and keeps coffee hot all day . 
this spatula is very flexible and thin allowing you to easily get under an omelette without any difficulty . 
anyway after some time i finally got it together and the cabinet itself is nice and roomy . 
i made num_num qts in just a couple days with this and would be lost without it . 
i shopped around and was thinking of buying an electric percolator when i came across the farberware yosemite percolator . 
these chopsticks are very well made and have a very nice finish . 
great protector and doesn t pull my hair while on the phone . 
this way your screen can t make contact with a surface if you set your phone face down . 
this waffle iron is the best !  i get nice ,  brown ,  crisp waffles every time . 
i don t use it as much as i thought i would . 
i ve purchased two sets about six months ago and had a chance to use every piece . 
i absolutely loved the case !  i love that it is pink and protects my iphone . 
now that i m aware of it ,  i always double check to make sure it s properly hinged . 
plain rounds on one end and fluted rounds on the other give you a total of ten options . 
i really like other zyliss products that i have bought in the past ,  and these are no exception . 
the attachments are great for removing dirt in higher areas i . e . 
ive been looking for a case for my white verizon num_extend for a while now . 
i bought one of these from another seller a couple of months earlier . 
i have not had any problems with this dish and have had it for over num_num yrs now . 
sometimes the television channel hesitates or breaks up if cell phone reception is less than perfect . 
i never lose this because it stays around my neck . 
they really do taste great ,  leave a nice crema and run well through my jura . 
originally i had this case before boxwave even had it . 
plus the olive oil and vinegar mixture cause the leaves to stick . 
the current version works fine and for less than $ i m happy with it . 
this item had some bad reviews . i decided to take a chance . 
i have used this a couple times as i spice grinder ,  and i love it . 
the prospect of being without espressos for a month brought on withdrawal symptoms . 
i have gotten many compliments on it for my entryway . 
the diamond accents provide a nice grip on the back of the phone . 
i bought the num_extend litre which is the perfect size for two or four people . 
what a nice looking table solid and no marks on it . 
the num_extend and num_extend amp charger gave you a normal charging symbol on the ipad . the num_extend is more picky . 
there are simply some pro techniques and tools that no home unit will replace . 
just got this case in the mail a couple of days ago . 
and i use this one quite frequently for measuring liquids . 
what that translates into is that you ll use it much more often because of its simplicity . 
i ve maintained it by sanding regularly and treating with mineral oil . 
personally i think the issue is widely overblown . 
this case is a nice case ,  but ,  it could be a lot better . 
this case is neat and very very colorful . 
my version had no way of getting in to clean it . 
imagine opening the lid and having all the moisture run to the back hinge of the lid . 
either they were both accurate ,  or both inaccurate the the exact same degree . 
and with that ,  it is able to take pictures in gray  black and white  ,  negative ,  sepia ,  and sketch . 
saw the roaster on america s test kitchen and ordered itthe same day . 
i also haven t had any problems with rust like i have had with some of my cookie cutters . 
the quality is better than i expected for the price that i paid . 
a fun way to make tasty ,  perfect cookies . 
this thing works great and provides plenty of power for all devices . 
i have no idea why and this is very annoying . 
this one fit the bill and looked pretty good . 
comfortable but it could use an adjustment option cause i have a huge head . 
i am in love with this coffee pot . 
anyone have some cake we can borrow ?  thanks . 
arrived well packed in its own box in a timely fashion . 
before getting this ,  i was always trying to find a place for the iron to cool . 
i feel a little cheated . wilton num_num num_num master decorating tipthe rating gets one star off after all this . 
i moved the ball with my finger nail and everything went back to normal . 
you can fill it with the lid shut as well as open ,  a thoughtful feature . 
it s not silicone ,  it s more like rubbery plastic . 
you must have the strawberries and whip cream ready for the first batch . 
i recharge it each night and it last all day with no issues . 
charging in the car and at work . no problems . 
the seller got the item to me quickly with free shipping . 
the handle is very soft and has finger and thumb indents at the top for very comfortable holding . 
most other brands are cut just a little too large for me . 
i have used this particular box and am almost thru it . 
i bought it specifically for flax seeds ,  but it works for other spices as well . 
if i decide to use it for whatever reason ,  i ll add to this . 
took forever but i finally got the correct beater for the num_extend
i am going to order this case in a few more colors !  . 
amazon made a screaming deal on these within the past month . 
but then again ,  i do use this machine quite a lot . 
i really did not expect much of a knife for the inexpensive price . 
this is the second presto pressure canner i ve owned . 
i must say ,  this bionaire is much better; i like the remote control . 
and it is nice and easy to maneuver . 
still have two to go ,  so will probably have new phone before i get to them . 
the xentris charger works perfectly with my galaxy nexus . 
got mine today after waiting for it to come off back order . 
this will work for any type of broad macaroni . 
it s been a real workhorse in my kitchen for num_extend years and counting . 
i love hearts so i was really excited to get this case . 
btw ,  amazon has a great ceramic hand grinder here too ,  as well as the best low cost espresso maker . 
but it works very good and i m glad i bought one . 
writing this now with my ampen on an ipad . 
hunter humidifiers seem to be a hit or miss type of product . 
i bought this particular strainer because another reviewer was pleased with its preformance . 
the only problem is that the steam should be stronger . 
i have not broken a single piece in that time . 
jar is indispensable if you are going to blend decent volumes of soup . buy this product . 
it buffers sometimes with videos when i have like num_num bars or less . 
i used it several times ,  it worked great . 
i m oxo obsessed so i would highly recommend this . 
the other one i bought was a thermoworks timer and i should have just bought num_num of those . 
coffee never made the same amount of coffee as the water i used . 
no freezer burn . i hope this company never goes out of business . 
it s smaller than your average masher and very sturdy . 
recharging ?  please . if you don t have bluetooth in your car this is a really good alternative ,  however . 
i really like the design and look of this case . 
i don t always want to lug that around for a quick clean up . 
once you pick it up ,  you ll be amazed . 
i like that they are dishwasher safe and the blades being stainless steel will never rust . 
there is no other blender in this price range that dares to compare itself with this one . 
i needed something a little better than the sharpener on my can opener ,  and this fills the bill . 
the funnel is fun to use and creates a beautiful effect into a wine carafe . 
as a zester ,  it is the best i have ever used . 
great value !  to buy these in stores they want way to much money . 
this thing works so well i have to turn the volume down . 
this model fits comfortable and i begin using sincronized with my lumia num_extend
the adjustable volume control consists of two well separated buttons ,  which are easy to find and manipulate . 
i have it set up toswitch easily between skype on my laptop and my cell phone . 
you snap the halves into place and they stay on firmly . 
it has a good weight and feel in my hand  i m a woman ,  aged num_extend
i received this cutting board as a gift about a year and it has held up very well . 
the cuisinart is too big to handle small amounts of most things . 
it charged my iphone and my ipad on one charge of the battery pack . 
the handle is very pretty and has a good grip . 
i purchased this scooper a few months ago and have used it several times since then . 
i can honestly say it makes the best home popped popcorn i have ever had . 
i saw this ,  the price is great and it works like a charm . 
they require you jiggle them or move them around to work after a while . 
peace of mind . i used a few external chargers before . 
with this product ,  you just take your spray nozzle and it rinses so much better . 
i like the color but what i wanted was a soft cover to absorb more g forces when dropped . 
i ended up getting an oster egg cooker that did the trick . 
as in ,  more easily than other plastic covers . 
several of friends and family have ordered them as well . 
buying another one because i always get compliments from friends ,  coworkers ,  and the ladies . 
some are super expensive and some ,  like this one ,  are reasonable . 
beware ,  the cast iron is hot and stays hot . 
these were rated so well and looked so unique online that i bought them . 
holds a charge for days ,  even weeks ,  without diminishing at all . 
electric percs were too harsh flavored for me . this pot works great . 
it is so easy to do and amazon delivers on their promises . 
if you hack the num_extend all bets are off . 
i even baked a pizza on the bottom tray and it cleaned up like a breeze . 
it s great for boosting the audio when the kids watch movies . 
all cases wont fit with the shield protector on . 
this is like a handi vac with a handle . 
i bought this for a gift and ended up keeping it for myself  :   . 
all the others i have used have broken in use . 
the user controls permit the user to easily control the headset with minimal distraction and time . 
these go on easily ,  and don t get stuck on the bar or the curtains . 
the square shape is much more practical than the round stones . 
found this great deal online and bought it . 
fast shipping ,  and arrived in us mailbox about num_num days after order . 
they come with num_num different sized rubber pieces for a customized fit . 
what struck me first about this knife is how wonderfully sharp it is . 
i like to go on long hikes or walks and listen to audio books . 
i had the standard one pocket holder on my dish rack but really like this one better . 
so i m satisfied num_extend stars  but not quite delighted . 
i use the egg separator ,  which works quite well ,  to make my egg white omelets . 
the filter holder is easy to remove and replace for an occasional rinsing . 
by far the num_extend had the best otter box cases . 
great for a single person or a couple . 
i am so happy with the fiesta ware . 
i have cooked lasagna ,  pie ,  rice dishes ,  and cookies . 
the size is perfect size and holds dough so it doesn t spread larger . 
now we have a stylish looking grinder and it is always clean . 
i am almost glad my old knife disappeared . 
it has a dial on the base to easily set the speed of the fan or turn it off . 
second headset works perfectly with num_extend num_extend and moto num_extend
in a pinch it can serve to make a good cup of joe with little else . 
it is just your basic screen protector dont realy have anything to say either way . 
i keep this as a back up battery for when my phone dies . 
my daughter was very happy with the selection she was able to make . 
couldn t be happier with it !  can be used in the oven or out on the gas grill . 
i have never had one of these bust out . 
just tried this out on my blender for the first time . 
the first two timers are both working just fine ,  both on the original batteries . 
too many of them are bulky or have an imperfect fit ,  but not this one . 
these are great to use when you are not canning but using the mason jars for other things . 
i love the color red ,  and this chopper is so useful . 
we sometimes use olive oil for a special taste treat . 
i love it when i can consolidate the junk i have to carry on trips ! nicely done ,  jabra !  . 
though i ve found i m using it that often for small canning jobs . 
i have purchased more nylon products to protect my nonstick cookware and my health . 
it was first brought to the market in num_extend then taken off and returned in the num_extend
easy to clean ,  good leverage ,  and stainless steel . 
had to remove it and replace it with the small handle from the old filter . 
i have ground a lot of coffee in it . 
until i recently got a new fridge with a deep enough butter section . 
i saw this whisk and figured it was worth a try . it definitely works great in my small pots . 
my sister had accidentally washed our other ice cream scooper . 
i ordered other num_num phones along with this . 
so don t assume from reviews that you will get a bad one that will melt on your dash . 
i love the three different bowls and all the attachments . 
the fibrox handle is well worth the added cost . 
i get tired of giant mugs sometimes ,  so that the tea cups a proper num_num oz . 
i liked that it came in white or black . 
on the first couple of tries ,  the bluetooth connections may not seem to work ,  but they do . 
the mildew odor was gone in minutes ,  as was the vinegar within an hour . 
anyway ,  this looks good on my table and suits us for everyday use . 
one plug home or car fits all ,  num_num stars for a top notch product . 
now ,  instead of getting egg all under my fingernails i can use this spatula to flip them over . great huh ?  . 
sound quality it top notch and the noise cancellation feature on this was amazing . 
speeds are adjustable and the cord is long enough for most jobs . 
it is not as loud as fan noise on a medium setting we have had in the bedroom previously . 
you do need to get the chemex filter which you need to keep in mind when ordering . 
so once it was on the phone you don t want to take it off . 
honestly ,  this thing is so cute and small . 
the remaining coffee is pleasantly hot for at least half and hour . 
it does have a cutout for the proximity detector on the phone . 
loved this back case cover it looks really nice on the black iphone . 
the thick plates allow the cleaning with a use of an abrasive such as bar keeper s friend . 
its enough to keep your headset safe from the daily hazzards yet ,  small so it does not seem bulky . 
unfortunately ,  there aren t as many apps for maemo as there are for symbian or apple . 
since i received it i have never once experienced the anxiety of running out of battery . 
i ve been using it to grind meat for making jerky . 
is very very good protection for the num_extend
i can t believe that i didn t think of this sooner . 
easy to get off when i change out my battery . 
as others have said ,  these work fine and are inexpensive . 
my loyalty to nokia has kept me out of touch . 
for the price i had little to lose . 
been searching quite a while for a good cup of coffee at home . 
to fill it ,  just unscrew the adjusting cap ,  remove the top and pour in the pepper corns . 
i can change to look in my iphone as needed . 
its real small ,  i can easily place it in the front of my back pack . 
they both charged quickly during the car trip i was on . simply ,  this device works very well . 
it would make a great stocking stuffer for the baker on your list or for a bridal shower . 
having the net gives you piece of mind for the evening and ensures a good night s sleep . 
thank you oster for continuing to make a quality product . 
this is the second one we purchased of this type coffeemaker . 
easy to apply if done correctly and perfectly clear once completely dry . 
the sooner you get the machine in there ,  the easier it is to clean . 
i purchased these to protect my tab and they work well . 
i think this is the differentiating feature that should make anyone s decision to buy this one a no brainer . 
i ve ordered more than num_extend because of the cool blue light emitted when plugged into my car . 
i now only purchase phone cases from amazon because they have the lowest prices . 
i have had this rice cooker for years . 
these screen protectors are very durable and are exactly as they say they are . 
it s not gonna last forever ,  but it s really well designed . 
i bough this for a family friend when she graduated high school and she loved it . 
i baked banana bread in it and just used pam cooking spray and it was perfect . 
i was amazed at how well these pieces store . 
my only complaint is that it only grinds about num_num ounces of coffee at a time . 
i have num_num different jabras ,  a motorola ,  another plantronics ,  and various other off brands . 
while my house is for sale in pa ,  we are renting in ri and must keep expenses low . 
some things just cook better in cast iron . 
this a great phone case for someone who wants their phone protected but doesn t like flashy cases . 
you can set the hotplate for num_extend num_extend or num_num hours before it shuts off . 
my coffee maker of choice is a num_num cup drip coffee maker with a gold cone . 
i m not suggesting verizon has best coverage in your area . 
the half moon shaped handle is on each end away from each of the burners . 
i know someone who bought one of these and had good experience . 
perfect size for novice bakers and chef alive . 
this is not a product for people who want  instant  ice cream . 
i will buy this again if i m able to used the large quantity up  :   . 
this scoop makes perfect ice cream shop scoops every time ,  and they never stick to the scoop . 
you can serve guests beyond two regular coffee instead anyway . 
i just don t get how some of these screen protectors can cost $ a piece . 
the travel mug that comes with it is perfect for coffee on the go . 
i ve also learned to pour slowly to avoid the aforementioned dribbles . 
unfortunately ,  a replacement glass pot isn t available if this breaks . 
but if wireless is a must for you ,  here you go . 
it is responsive and accurate and at a great price . 
only amplifies what is being piped through without adjusting the volume of the hearing aids themselves . 
i m pretty sure nothing can hurt my iphone now . 
they hav not rusted and held up good so far . 
tenderize and cook to near perfection some chicken you num_extend
this thing is the big daddy of dutch ovens . 
for the money ,  this bosch is a great coffee maker . 
good coffeethis machine seems to keep the temperatures right and makes very good coffee . 
if you want to cool down a space this thing is your tool . 
i can t believe the quality of these pans for the price !  they are nice and heavy weight . 
i ve used it for cookies and i have used it to core apples to make apple tarts . 
the loop that holds them together will easily snap on or off . 
apparently aclear glass percolator top ,  fits farberware ,  etc . can be purchased for an additional $
it serves well as normal earphones as well . 
i throw away those that just don t cut it  pun intended  . 
and ,  they are very easy to clean !  i love my measuring cups . 
this kettle has been doing its job in my kitchen for num_num years of almost daily use . 
i use it to attach tether my canon num_extend mark num_num to my samsung note num_extend num_num edition tablet . 
the cutter stayed on the counter without my having to hold it in place . 
get the pan really hot ,  season the steak and put it in the pan . 
it heats evenly and effeciently and is super easy to clean . 
at least you still know my phone is white . 
i was looking at the commuter ,  but it had some bad reviews indicating it had a loose design . 
this little hot pot is terrific when one is away from home and has no kitchen . 
last battery was dying within a couple of hours ,  new battery last the day . 
the quality of this pan is first rate and should last through many life times . 
i am very satisfied with both the quality and the design of this product . 
i haven t had any issues with it whatsoever . 
so small things like garlic can be chopped up easier . once you turn on the machine ,  you feel the quality . 
the breville goes through them quickly and leaves less moisture than green power . 
this is the real deal the oem case . 
the up button is track forward ,  the down button is track back . 
these filters last quite a while because of the prefilter so they are a good value . 
main wire from the connector to the split ,  is thicker on the original headphones vs . 
definitely boosts my signal with my samsung galaxy num_extend on att with lte . 
my mom has shaky hands and this works great for her . 
i have had this kettle for over num_num years and use it daily . 
i have an iphone num_num from version and it fits perfectly and it looks so pretty . 
read the easy ,  illustrated directions ,  because this can opener really does work differently . 
i won t go on and on ,  but i love this dansk line . 
i flipped through the manual ,  which provides fairly basic instructions . 
built to last . i ve given all my old single wire fulcrum pants hangers to people i dislike . 
you do have to replace it at least once every num_num months depending on your water . 
they are also light but don t feel cheap . 
perfect size for my big oster toaster oven . 
this is my favorite spatula thingee for eggs or for getting things off the cookie sheet . 
i love my new grinder ,  i have been experimenting with different beans and the coffee tastes fresh and delicious . 
the maker had funtioned flawlessly throughout the duration and the the coffee comes out great every time . 
only a few of my knives are henckels but even the others fit nicely . 
at first it takes some time to get used to it ,  but it s worth it . 
this makes everything fast and easy . i find the bun warming compartment to be a kind of a silly feature . 
is what i bought it for ,  and it s working beautifully . 
the rest goes in the compost heap ,  no waste and no mess . 
we use a nationally known food home delivery service that has about anything your appetite may desire . 
i am truly delighted ,  and the air flow balance is wonderful !  . 
i love this attachment . if you re debating this one ,  get it !  you won t be disappointed . 
i use these to freeze a special supplement ,  i make up for my cats . 
i particularly bought this juicer for wheatgrass and other hard vegetables . 
i used it to fit my phone case and it works fine . 
it s solidly constructed ,  and the brake feature is nice . 
nice leather holster u can clip it on your belt or lace you belt through the back . 
i will buy a couple more of these hangers . 
it actually lifts my carpet up while vacuuming . 
this case is a must have for anyone with an iphone . 
it is also rather subjective . this unit works best for my wife and me and our straightforward needs . 
clean towelette and clean out any of the residual spices left in the unit . 
i like the little rocker on top better because i know exactly how much pressure it has . 
the lid was a plus and fits tightly . 
no ,  i m no measly featherweight cook ,  but this is still mega heavy ,  especially with the small handle . 
i bought this case for the lg optimus v and it fits great . 
heavy thick glass ,  easy to grip and does not slip from my hands ,  holds two sticks of butter nicely . 
this case is awesome !  i m buying another one . 
this one will tell you ,  with a voice ,  when you re connected and when you re not . 
everyone loves them ,  and i use mine every time i take a bath . 
this is best vacuum i have owned for picking up pet hair and even cat litter . 
if you ve got the skillet ,  you ve got to have the lid . 
i ve been using this weekly since i received it in oct num_extend
i love them anyway and use them all the time . 
also ,  my canvas bag tends to let fatty or oily icings seep through the bag ,  causing greasy hands . 
a little more trouble than some microwave cookers ,  but worth it . 
the slickness is handy when slipping the phone into your pocket . great price . 
they work for both red and white wine which makes planning easier . 
my old spatula has a thin edge then the blade slowly widens ,  providing support . 
it s comfortable ,  but not something i would want to wear for hours on end . 
if that bugs you ,  buy a hard brush and just brush out over the sink . 
paring is not an issue with wired devices . 
fits perfectly ,  just like they were supposed to . 
i have also used a mediabridge dual usb car charger putting out num_extend amps . 
too cool ,  the yeast wont activate .  .  .  .  . too hot ,  you ll kill the num_extend
but i had hoped to use it to bring along coffee ,  soup etc . 
i cant believe this price ,  what a fantastic deal . 
found this ,  and it even has a handle ,  which my original didn t have . 
you can t take it off without breaking it . 
they hold items tightly and don t release them until you take them off the clips on purpose . 
you can fit easily meat on the grill for a family of four if not more . 
lifter is also well made and is excellent when pulling your jars out all at once . 
not showing any deterioration and i have had them for over num_num months now . 
i find that a nylon spatula ,  shoved under the meat from time to time ,  releases it well . 
with the sprint cdma hero ,  it took weeks to finally see improvement . 
inside a five to six person tent ,  it warmed the space quite nicely on the high setting . 
a neat little gadget to have in the kitchen . 
works great for what i need it to do and you certainly can t beat the price !  . 
today after my baking was finished i did num_num recipes from the manual . 
it is easy to put on and remove . 
i did more baking than normal for me over the holidays and it worked perfectly . 
with glass you get none of those drawbacks . 
i love the screen for its crisp colors and visibility in direct sunlight . 
first ,  i wanted to be able to take written notes in my asus transformer prime . 
gently use the roller to flatten or push dough around . 
it s fast ,  responsive ,  and does everything i hoped it would . 
yes ,  and it s a dandy looking little thing too . 
other than that ,  i am very pleased with this product . 
i estimate that this cheesecloth is about a num_num grade . 
i got this t keep in the car for emergencies . 
i bought this knife and we love it .  .  .  . the cut outs allow it to easily cut through cheese . 
used this as a stocking stuffer with other coffee gift items . 
this has bluetooth  mic and speakers  so you can do conference calls . 
i like it so much i bought it for my car also . 
i use my hands and not a paper towel to avoid leaving lint on the pan . 
like it so much i will buy another for my daughter . 
the container  like a comet can  is gold with blue and white writing . 
the feel is nice  i . e .  ,  better grip  and the clip is easy to work . 
i have to knock a star off my review for that . 
i discovered long ago that the right tool makes the job easier . 
before discarding the bread machine i thought i might try tinkering around with the recipe . 
works exactly as expected and gets my phone charged up quickly . 
i just have a lot of hard floor to scrub . 
west bend should be proud of this product . 
in the pictures ,  it looks as though the purple is really bright . 
these little vac dirt bags seem to work just fine . 
so far ,  it appears that the stainless is good quality . 
now why can t everything be made this good ?  opens cans and lasts and lasts . 
i learned graffiti for the palm and used it for years . 
but this steam mop is so convenient and easy ,  i won t mind mopping . 
but i clean as i use it ,  so it s never been a problem . 
this is very nice and looks great sitting on the top of my stove . 
love this product !  my daughter stole my old one years ago . 
it seems durable and the brew time isn t very long  maybe num_num minutes for a full pot  . 
usually i go around and brush those out before starting roomba . 
i decided to give it one more try and get the george jr . 
it works well for either sending messages or playing games . 
if there were ten stars i would give this product num_num points . 
i wouldn t live without this now that i own one . 
of course that doesn t have anything to do with the cutter itself . 
i would make every meal in it if i could . 
the  d shaped grip  feels nice ,  and the knife really holds an edge !  . 
well constructed ,  durable ,  and just the right size and shape . 
this oxo stainless steel garlic press ,  is a great kitchen helper . 
i do this at least once or twice a week and make a few pounds of yogurt each time . 
i m buying more to give as a gift . 
we stay with the machine until we unplug it so there are no issues of melting the machine . 
this is not a commercial use product and it does not behave as one . 
it is wide enough to go across a brick of sharp cheddar without chewing up the corners . 
resolution was to turn off bluetooth on the ipad ,  delete the pairing ,  and retry . 
the swingaway can opener still seems to be terrific after all these years . 
a nice way to aggregate all feeds from facebook ,  twitter and flickr into one single screen . 
the grandkids love to help make and eat our creations . 
it was okay ,  a bit slow with actions here and there . 
i would recomend that they change this and maybe use velcrow or a snap because magnets do not last . 
this is my second otterbox case ,  i have a defender also . 
i love this grill !  now ,  i know that nothing beats charcoal but this is the next best thing . 
purchased this to do foot soaks and ,  for me ,  it has perfect size and depth . 
no drawbacks to this product that i have found . 
i think it took the normal amount of time . 
i can also bring it to the table . 
table and chairs are very sturdy ,  and a great deal for the price . 
it has lines on each edge ,  you cut it ,  you use it . 
and trust me , i try a lot of bluetooth for my car before i got this one . 
we started smelling a rubber burning smell and cleaned out everything we could ,  but it still smelled . 
it also takes quite some time to recharge if you are coming from totally empty . 
i d buy it again and again ,  but i m not sure i ll need to !  . 
it is better than putting a cork back in a bottle . 
i love to cook ,  and own several different brands of cookware ,  all clad ,  cuisinart ,  and calaphone . 
it stores quite well in the refrigerator due to its compact size . 
the charge cord is usb to micro usb . 
it goes through the dishwasher well ,  a big plus in this household . 
i would expect it to last maybe num_num years based on my twice a week or so usage . 
the old one didn t do that so that answers why it felt lighter than my old one . 
it s not flimsy or cheap looking like some of the other grills available . 
i purchased these as a gift for my mother . 
the minutes do not expire as long as the service is extended before the expiration date . 
so the item was returned with no problem at all . 
now i love how lightweight and easy my dyson maneuvers . 
we have been very satisfied with these chargers . 
i used to sharpen my knives with many different hand sharpening tools . 
verizon could still be having some num_extend problems too . 
instead of a shoe rack which needs oopening etc . 
i never use it and have several other stylish cases that fit its clip even better than it did . 
my wife s rabbit sounds much better when i call her . 
it is super easy to peel any kind of fruit i want . 
charging time using the usb cable is longer than using the ac adapter . 
i purchased this little steamer through amazon ,  and it arrived promptly and in good condition . 
aside from having big hands ,  i have a large neck . 
 i forgot to mention i used this to fry doughnuts for breakfast .  easy to clean . 
these screen covers fit perfectly ,  are very ,  very protective and last a long time . 
sweaty palms will force you to adjust the salt in your recipe . 
you won t need to replace them for a very long time . 
we put all our meats and poultry in bags made from the rolls for storage in our freezer . 
have used this product for over a year . 
the wire is long enough ,  fits into the car socket easily and charges the phone . 
these work exactly as you would hope and they feel very durable . 
for those of you who want a breville ,  but a more heavy duty model ,  check out sur la table . 
if you use the droid at a desk for music and such ,  this is a great tool . 
another terrarium with houses ,  people ,  moss ,  flowers and looking lovely . 
i got this just before i got my htc evo shift . 
no more sitting down with your phone stabbing you in the hip . 
many ,  many applications ,  you re only bound by your own imagination !  !  !  . 
you can cook a bunch of food on it at once . 
although i have only used it once so far it seems like a quality product . 
they re sturdy and have a great smooth surface . 
once jar is frozen ,  you can put it up right if you desire . 
i don t know what i d do without it . 
it s easy to use this to spray on veggies and encourages me to use olive oil vs . 
this works great for my kiddo with asthma . 
uses same water wick and air filter parts . 
we eat a lot of grilled foods and this is perfect . 
she likes to make her own batter and then freeze some of the finished product for the coming week . 
however ,  do not use the melitta pods that are available . 
we love this charger because it minimizes the cords that need to be organized . 
preheat on high then lower temperature after searing meats to maintain juicy meats . 
when there s an accidental spills ,  this must be used as soon as it happens for it to work . 
have also carried it out on the golf cart with me occasionally and it does the job there too . 
and again ,  this is not meant for whole house cleaning . 
i m sure it affects that pot of coffee ,  and i don t exactly uses the cheapest coffee . 
you are better off sticking it to a smoother surface like your windshield . 
these are not cheap feeling and they still look brand new after several years of use . 
great spatula ,  poor color choice on my part . 
however ,  it is slightly heavier and its heat response time is slower . 
i have a new daily coffee ritual now with this pot andcafe bustelo coffee espresso . 
to make things more sweeter ,  the music transfer is possible over bluetooth . 
this takes the mess out of many tasks like blending soups and gravies . 
i think i will reduce the amount of grinds a bit the next time i try this . enjoy !  . 
the seal is thight so no batter seeps out ,  bakes even . 
i have had this kettle once before and it lasted for years . 
something i never had to think about with the cheap units . 
my husbands favorite dish to prepare in this cooker is pot roast . 
all i can say is it brews one hell of a cup of coffee . 
one of my favorite items !  works great ,  makes your food even more tasty ,  great size . 
i saw reviews for this product saying it wasn t motorola etc . 
i own two and want to buy more . 
the detachable cleaner part can get misplaced and is not all that convenient . 
it works good for my ipad as well for music . 
the water jacket is wonderful for when you need something to stay very hot or very cold . 
she says ,  she doesn t have to heat it a cup at a time . 
i am happy with the service ,  delivery and product . 
no longer will you have to bake num_num dozen cookies just to get num_num edible ones . 
it is a very cheap stylus ,  but they put some odd ,  soft material at the tip . 
my rottweiler loved the yogurt and lapped it up eagerly . 
it will keep the pasta untangled and aids greatly in transferring the pasta from pot to serving dish . 
either way ,  you end up with a bit of unpopped popcorn . 
since i am always in the kitchen when i boil the water ,  this has not been an issue . 
it has a pleasant feel to it ,  yes slides easily into and out of his pockets . 
it recharges my samsung fascinate with no problem on my drive home from work . 
it s fast and can easily be moved from car to car  provided it has the cd slot  . 
this strainer works like a charm to press liquid from canned tuna . 
since i bought it ,  i have found that i use it more often than i thought i would . 
once i was introduced to the silpat ,  i cannot imagine my kitchen without one . 
if it does ,  just soak it in warm water for a while and it will dissolve . 
still a great product ,  good thing its not expensive . 
that s cause the place i intended to put it is on a cabinet that butts up against the cooktop . 
i think the purifier is rated for num_num sq feet . 
voice is clear on both ends and the volume is more than adequate . 
it has a big wheel and cuts through everything . 
i d definately recommend this product as a budget friendly set of everyday plates . 
they nest inside each other so they take up less space . 
i have a smaller toaster oven and these pans fit perfectly . 
for a long time ,  i just used a measuring cup to pour my water in . 
they were almost over cooked ,  tender and delicious ! i am going to love this cooker . 
you would be surprised at how many scissors ,  even good brands ,  fail this test . 
i was originally hesitant to purchase this product . 
so when i ordered this i was very skeptical but wow . 
i bought the dyson animal as a gift to myself . 
bought this set to replace my old plastic storageware; i had concerns over bpa in the plastic . 
quite happy with my purchase and highly recommend it for such purposes . 
she was able to locate colors in the style she wanted . 
i am very impressed with the amazonbasics line . 
keeps my tablet screen clean ,  easy to apply ,  i am very satisfied . 
this phone ,  however ,  is short and slim enough to make that problem negligible . 
this dock allows me to bring up navigation while driving around town with my droid x . 
what more could you ask ?  oh ,  and only $ stars . 
this board on the test kitchen recommended list . 
my children have abused them occasionally ,  but with a good steel ,  the nicks in the edges have been repaired . 
everything i read about was ,  for me ,  unfounded . the bread i made with this was absolutely delicious . 
it was a great price and we needed a new waffle iron . 
seriously ,  i stabbed my iphone num_extend with a knife  on accident  ,  and not a scratch . 
amazon to the rescue !  they had the oxo good grips listed as a  large flexible turner  . 
it is less conspicuous than a suction cup mount but does the same job . 
i used it for years and then with three young children s i decided i didn t have time to can . 
the seam that some other posts have mentioned is invisible on our glasses . 
it works great for drying fresh cut pasta doe . 
no complaints about this product from warm mart . 
very sharp but doesn t cut fingers or hands . 
the plastic is fairly sturdy and it doesn t take up much space in my drawer . 
i did talk her out of her old heating base; i can use it for pancakes . 
but it cleans the floors pretty well and can clean both hardwood and carpet with two different settings . 
small enough footprint to fit in a corner . couldn t be easier to clean . 
ok ,  so yes ,  this is a large machine . 
this one struck me as both well designed and economical . 
this is heat resistant silicone ,  and as such ,  you don t have the effects of metal directly on your food . 
has no sharpener ,  but has a place for a sharpener . 
perhaps that is what makes the funny looking spots on the pan . 
they didn t have the rest of the sizes so i turned to amazon to find the rest . 
sometimes the adjustable input cable connector gets loose and just needs to be plugged in tightly . 
what a wonderful machine ,  it s like getting a bmw after driving ford pickup trucks all your life . 
i got this unit andher health has improved dramatically . 
also ,  it is very light and easy to store . 
the best sharpener i have found so far . 
it has very sturdy handles ,  and a thick ,  heavy bottom ,  which holds in heat well . 
my oval grill pan is used for chicken ,  veggies ,  grilled clams ,  and beef . 
good grippiness . regarding the button cutouts on this phone  which really aide in making buttons easier to press  . 
this works well however a good old fashioned masher works as well for me . 
i had one similar for my old blackberry . 
the sound quality is very good num_extend out of num_num stars  . 
for $ it is more than worth the lifetime it is going to last you . 
i have even used them to cut paper and cardboard on occasion . 
i needed a replacement and this filled the bill . 
it is a basic scale sutiable for many tasks . 
paid for itself in one month of not using the old big filled water bath . 
the quality was good enough that we couldn t tell whether we were using the bt or just the phone . 
these glasses are everything they were purported to be . 
my last one lasted several years but finally died . 
the utensils feel solid and much more expensive than they are . 
good product headset has an eight hour talk time unlike other headsets . 
those who insist on very hot coffee for periods of one hour or more ,  however ,  may be num_extend
i purchased ivyskins ,  this and that ,  plus two others i can t remember the names of before trying this case . 
it really only works with large grain loose leaf tea . 
for standard home use you can t go wrong . 
this lid is very nice quality cast iron . 
the thing that i like most is that it holds a charge for a long time . 
this was to replace my blue ant that died ,  not a good choice . 
it sure doesn t seem like it puts out that much current though . 
i would want a different material and a better working pen . 
and to get that i really had to conserve my use of the phone . 
i have only done this once and learned my lesson . 
once i got the crust in ,  i was convinced they weren t too small because the depth was perfect . 
and ,  you often need to do both at the same time ,  so they make a very nice team . 
it works the same and is equally heavy ,  but i like wide better . 
i already own a large and small pyrex lasagna pan . 
much more convenient than leaving the old num_num piece lid on the jar . 
they are great for turning just about anything . 
they should make this out of all metal . 
you can t beat their resiliency ,  lightweight sturdiness and easy cleanup . 
its easy to use and to clean as well . 
my sister and i whipped together a banana bread loaf . 
great product ,  arrived in nice packaging ,  would def buy again !  . 
i got them because they were cheaper to buy than at the store . 
i got an % charge out of the power charger before it went dead . 
not to heavy ,  needed it for my other car so i comes in handy . 
sometimes i use it for unified remote to control my tv . 
wow ,  what a great deal this tracfone is . 
i only charged it when it was below %
they were good covers for the price that i paid . 
for the price ,  i don t mind the small balancing act i have to do to get this to work . 
we have several touchscreen devices ,   android and ios  ,  and it works flawlessly with all of them . 
but we haven t had that issue in over a year . 
which is also fine  :  i have never used an ice cream maker before this one . 
this is a real eureka filter ,  it s not a generic as some claim . 
we moved to a country where ground beef tends to include cartlidge and bone . 
so i m enjoying it ,  even though it cost me a bunch of money . 
other competitor s products are superior in this areas . 
the taste difference using the vacuum sealed process is amazing . 
i bought this for my mother after having used the identical model for myself for over a year . 
it may take a try or two to get it perfect num_extend
if you use tap water ,  the filter is a wonderful idea . 
despite a few negative reviews i still bought this and it carved up a great turkey this christmas . 
i m only using them for dry goods ,  so i can t attest to how well they work with liquids . 
 :   plus ,  for $ you can t expect it to last forever . 
i love this for chopping garlic and small amounts of items . 
i have bought one of these for each of our houses . 
very good and inexpensive way to replace the belt clip part of my otterbox case . 
just the right size for pastry or bread . 
so as for cutting goes ,  ceramic is definitely better . 
i bought this for my nephew and he loves it . 
i live in the sticks ,  so being able to buy a replacement battery for my droid phone is useful . 
the material is ok ,  could be more durable but not bad . 
the hot dogger is an ideal appliance for the bar where daily hot dog sale is about five . 
my favorite is miss vickies book of pressure cooker recipes ,  also found on amazon . 
i am thoroughly satisfied . i also bought the book :  the big book of juices and smoothies . 
left a message and did not receive a return call . 
the plastic cup with lid that came with it was an added bonus . 
this device produces a good ,  consistent cup of coffee . 
i dropped my phone into the toilet bowl .  .  . by mistake . 
i contacted the manufacturer and they said they will be coming out with a glass lid sometime in may . 
it is a mini oven and for busy families or just busy people . 
seems to be pretty good protection and seems durable . 
that way we save a ton of money to spend on other vacation things . 
i got great use out of this case and it has been put through somethings . 
this way you will get twice the juice and save money . 
but then again ,  so what ?  the essence of an iphone is still there . 
it is very easy to use and clean . 
we bought this unit about a year ago and it helped . 
they are hooked up to my num_extend where i listen to num_extend and pandora . 
 has num_num latches on either side u have to press to release  so thats kinda cool too . 
the large frying pan started sticking a few months ago . 
my old one starts to wear out about num_num years old  so i bought this new one . 
they re exactly what they showed in the pictures ,  and compliment my kitchen very well . 
oh well . i would highly recommend this headset to anyone looking for one . 
i cannot believe that this was not invented before . 
these were perfect for what i ended them for . 
the first thing i tried slicing was a num_num pound pit ham . 
a knife that is uncomfortable to use can be worse than useless . 
another issue is the amount of dust this kicks up . 
the weighing tray just lifts off and is easy to wash . 
it s held up just as good as new . 
this is at least in part due to the swivel stop . 
we didn t use it for coffee beans though . 
they make crispy shells and are easy to clean . 
fast ,  quiet compared to the propeller devices ,  and very uniform and coarse grind . 
a gift for my daughter and she loves it very much . 
i don t lose it because it fits right into my phone . 
i only wish i had purchased the num_num cup model which is what i previously had . 
works real easy ,  except when trying stuff almond paste . 
we were somewhat skeptical about how the machine would work but were pleasantly surprised . 
we purchased this little fan for our kid s room . 
its not top of the line stero quality but still very good for price . 
i got these to replace the cheap plastic tupperware around the house . 
i m not sure if i caused the issue or not ,  all glitches and no physical damage . 
clean up was easier than easy  i did spray it with vegetable oil first  . 
i don t clean it between uses ,  and it seem to be fine . 
it doesn t get any nicer than this !  super easy to use and the grinder is quick and effective . 
i use this oil dispenser for olive oil and keep it by the stove . 
i have seen some with spouts on both sides ,  but they are not as nice as this one . 
nice thick gauge that you come to expect from pyrex . 
looked at reviews and checked fans in the store . 
if there s anything that cast iron likes less than fried eggs ,  it s scrambled . 
unfortunately ,  the replacement doesn t include new screws ,  and when it broke one of the screws went missing . grrrr . 
i ordered this case for my lg encore . 
not much else good to say about it ,  and nothing bad . 
i ve ordered a replacement carafe and a spare complete unit . 
i do bread dough in my new one and am extremely pleased with the results . 
the jabra supreme ,  though ,  suits me just fine . 
you can control the amount of oil and flavoring . above all ,  it is fast . 
i find it s easier to hold than my iphone . 
mine is over a year old and still cleans up as good as new . 
once this one cracks i will probably buy a new one . 
it certainly gives me the impression that it will not slide around on a slick table . 
i like the slow release of aroma as i grind . 
i especially love that it is pink too . 
this is a great kitchen tool !  i always have mine handy . notes :  num_extend the bristles are very sturdy . 
brown your meat ,  then deglaze and make your sauce ,  braise ,  whatever . 
even though this case is truly an amazing product ,  it still isn t perfect . 
the fat gutter takes up  alot  of space . otherwise ,  absolutely perfect . 
being the cheapskate that i am and not really needing a big tray ,  this one works fine for me . 
that is important !  !  each and every one is fantastic !  . 
to be honest ,  we have never had a chen product that was not the best . 
the watercolors pattern is playful and appeals to my eclectic nature . 
it was shipped to me on time and is till working great as of present . 
might seem a little large at first ,  but both my wife and i got use to them very quickly . 
for the money this is a great stone . 
useful and attractive and i ve had compliments on it from others . 
and i don t even play one on tv . 
it is handy for more things than you would expect . 
i love them and the sizes are perfect . 
we had researched several brands  mostly european  before settling on the kitchenaid javastudio . 
i had to open it up and clean out the brush area . 
warning :  don t make the mistake of buying the num_num model it is smaller for about the same price . 
i am careful though when setting or lifting my cookware . 
i tried a cheese grater and broke the handle . 
as for the quality ,  our bowls are fine qualify . 
the headset is so light and comfortable . for the price ,  this is a very good and versatile head set . 
the bright blue led light circular m logo is nice . 
i have used one for years and wouldn t be without it . 
the real benefit of my bodum french press is the appliances simplicity . 
well done ,  new trent ,  and i would highly recommend this product . 
but i used it for months and the tree picture was awesome . 
i had a num_num tb scoop and it was just a little too big for cookies . 
its small but keeps all my knives in great shape . 
the instant on is a neat feature ,  no more waiting while you re trying to pickup a call . 
blade is nice and wide . el salvador machete ,  num_num in . 
the portion is just right too .  .  . for an adult or a kid . 
how much would that have added to the cost ,  really ?  the old machine had a switch . 
if i m sitting around just listening to music ,  i might choose something else . 
these are good quality screen protectors that add a sleek look to your iphone . 
it does an even heating so most of the corn gets popped . 
it works quite well ,  though you do give up certain features . the num_extend inch screen is an absolute delight . 
other than steaks  cast iron  this pan does meats the way they should be done . 
i like to start reveiws with shortcomings ,  but there really aren t any . 
these are just what i was looking for and at a reasonable price . 
this is a must have when you bake a lot of cookies . 
it s great for egg salad ,  deviled eggs and any other small volume mashing job . 
also ,  got more than one so when this one gets crappy i have another num_num to work with . 
i ll pour a small cuppa to enjoy and do that through the day . 
i lightly oiled the grids the first time i used it ,  and have not had to again . 
dropped my phone a few times and they did a beautiful job of protecting my phone . 
great product much bigger then what you expect . 
once put on it last a long time and doesn t get scratched . 
i m building a complete set of fiesta ware . 
i wanted to use a permanent metalic coffee filter ,  but it would not fit . 
holds all muy food without me worrying about it falling apart . 
this not only is a good frier but i use it as a pot to make soup ,  etc . 
i adapted the preparation i saw on tv . 
stop agonizing ,  just buy one . update :  my beloved little chopper died on sept . 
this cuisinart is nice and quiet and so pretty . 
i purchased this coffee maker about a month ago after my mr . 
i ve gone through a lot of plastic sets and finally got sick of them breaking . 
my job requires me to take a lot of notes while i talk on the phone . 
the battery wall charger actually charges any battery for the evo num_extend
i made some chocolate chip cookies yesterday and used my new oxo measuring cups . 
i wish this color would match with the rest of the primary colors le creuset offers . 
possibly cutting back the serving may help ,  depending on your brand of corn . 
not too much to say in the review itself . 
i can hardly wait to find more food processor recipes . 
i have never had problems with a wet application screen protector . 
i have had to actually grab it out of my husband s hands . 
i purchased one from google and now this second one a year later . 
i use a six cup french press coffee maker ,  and the carafe holds about num_num of this six cups . 
it s affordable yet it works great and lasts for years . 
the old one lasted for about num_num years and was a great machine ,  this one is even better . 
the raised lip in the front gives some screen protection when laying the phone face down on a table . 
the medium rack fits perfectly inside this roaster . 
it was probably num_num years old ,  so lifetime was adequate . 
what can i say ,  it is cardboard that goes under a cake . 
my wife was constantly having to charge her inspire num_extend
i decided to get a second battery to keep in my pocket . 
for what it is worth ,  the extra half second it takes to get your phone isn t a big deal . 
it holds just over one tbs of grounds and produces a perfect americano every time . 
for the price its the best thing i could own ,  it preforms great . 
the best part they also include a backside protector as well . 
i only used it twice and the stem would not come out . 
this is not the first one i have owned . 
it just worked !  would recommend this and buy again . 
nice little case ,  doesn t make the phone large . 
the bag less option is also easy and quick . 
these are a full num_num ounces !  the design is corning s french white . 
i was concerned that the steel would change the taste of the brew ,  but that is not an issue . 
this was a good looking ,  durable thermos at a great price point . 
it s made well enough that it gives you a quality read each and every time you use it . 
just used it for the first time on our cherry tree . 
this is exactly what i needed ,  it protects amazingly . 
not a problem with the zagg cord management system . 
no defect of any kind ,  accurate and reliable . 
very easy to put on and you can t beat the price !  . 
the only down side to this case for me is removing it from the phone . 
i would buy this size again ,  great for fitting in the oven with other dishes . 
in that case it can store up to num_num cds ,  num_num dvds or num_num vhs tapes . 
it s a very strong magnet so no chance of it falling off and getting lost . 
i would expect that since they are covered and will probably get easier as the case gets broken in . 
eforcity num_extend stereo headphone headset compatible with htc evo num_extend phone eforcity is a great headphone headset . 
comfy in your ears not hurtful like some of the harder ear buds . 
i really like my new otterbox commuter series iphone case for my num_extend
the handle looks small ,  but was very comfortable in my large hands . 
have spent a little and a lot and still only have one or two shears i can depend on . 
these grips are made well and grip tight . 
lid is easy for our num_num year old to open by himself . 
this bigger size holds plenty for a meal . 
if you re looking for a decent headset that won t break the bank ,  the motorola num_extend should serve you well . 
exactly what i was expecting and it looks lovely . 
with the price i ordered more so i could share them with family and friends . 
its easy to care for as long as you understand how cast iron skillets must be cared for . 
since it takes about num_num minutes in the rice cooker ,  i doubt that i ll ever use that appliance again . 
i own several and they work well enough . 
it slides in and out of my pocket easily . i love that the side buttons are completely covered . 
i am a fan of new trent and their products . 
i decided to try these and well they so much easier . 
i used this pasta roller to make perogy dough . 
love that it can be used with anything that has a usb cord . 
not too costly ,  but they sell two with only one lid . 
the recipe for mango pops includes orange ,  apple ,  banana and lemon ,  which are too many competing flavors . 
this pot rack has a sturdy build to it . 
the protective sheath protects both you and the ultra sharp edges . 
i am going to buy another one right now . 
i use a baratza virtuoso grinder set at num_extend with colombian supremo beans ,  the grind is about right . 
and i kind of wish the inside of the mortar was a little shinier . 
it s nice for a storage box of my num_num cup cuisinart blades . 
it feels like a substantial piece of kitchen equipment . 
at first i wasnt sure if i would like the presurized portafilter . 
really the only problem is that there is not cut out for the charging port . 
definitely recommend to others for iphone num_num or num_extend
bought as replacement bedding for well worn sheets . 
you need to buy the jabra gel earpieces to use on it . 
i had one friend abandon it for the breville for this reason . 
you must put it in ,  camera up ,  with the back of the phone toward you . 
after trying the nilke branded unit previously ,  i have found this one far superior especially in the gym . 
i  use lower heat setting !  solid aluminum with hard anodized surface is the most efficient for heat transfer . 
these were a bit bigger than i expected ,  which is good for us . 
i drink a bunch of water and having a num_num pack makes things easy when onegets old . 
the price is a bargain relative to other steak knives ,  too . 
the increase in suction ,  though ,  really blew me away . 
overall it seems to be very durable and definitely adorable . 
bake a cake and you ve got the plastic cover for storage . 
its protected her phone more then a few times . 
i just ran it under water and put it in the dishwasher and it came out sparkling clean . 
also tried them out on my ipod touch and zen touch num_extend
there is a cute version with a bun warmer ,  and several models with larger grills . 
you can set the machine to automatically turn off from num_num to num_num hours later . 
first the flaps to cover the camera and usb port were a little annoying . 
nothing ever sticks or burns in it ,  even veggies . 
the swivel style also peels off only what you want to peel off and nothing more . 
i use to can .  .  .  . but now use most of my jars just for storage . 
it is not so loud ,  and i appreciate that . 
it is simple ,  well made and unpretentious ,  as most revereware items are . 
keep in mind that i also make whole wheat dough and like it extra crispy . 
i had heard great things about this case ,  and decided it looked stylish . 
but there is no fear the phone will fall out . 
if you need the coffee waiting for you in the morning ,  then you ll be cleaning the grinder every day . 
construction feels flimsy but will likely hold up . 
if you leave it on high the popcorn burns and sticks to the bottom of the popper . 
i ve toasted breads of various thickness ,  as well as bagels ,  buns ,  and cheese breadsticks with consistent results . 
maybe it ll get easier with practice . for the price ,  i am ecstatic with this little guy . 
glad i bought these ,  and look forward to using them for years to come . 
however ,  whenever i plug it in and push it in tight it works flawlessly . 
it works great and is really easy to clean . 
the case fits extremely well and looks sleek and sophisticated . 
about the only downside is that it lacks a usb port ,  so i can simultaneously charge my tablet . 
it worked as i intended and i ve used it a couple more times for other stuff too . 
of water ,  so i get two cups per kettle ,  even with my gargantuan num_extend mug . 
it s great !  i have no worries about the bakeware reacting with any food i cook in it . 
can never expect it to be as great as the original  hence four stars  but they did the job . 
the fiber mesh just glides smoothly over my ereader screen and over the anti glare screen protector . 
my husband is the one who makes our lattes ,  etc . 
bottomline ,  nicely balanced hanger with plastic grip so the plants don t crease or slide . 
i bought this pot because i am trying to cut back on the use of teflon coated products . 
for very soft or gooey cookie doughs this scoop can save you a huge amount of time . 
and what s more ,  the thirty seconds i don t have to stand there holding the button down delight me . 
definitely worth the price !  have had it for about num_num weeks and no problems yet !  . 
i ve owned a couple juice squeezers in the last few years . 
the groves were a little uneven but for low cost cutting boards they are ok . 
it produces good sound quality with a clear base when i tried it with my iphone . 
it took about a month to get to me ,  but i understand it came from hong kong . 
i would buy another one if i needed too . 
i like using these for leftovers to take for lunch so i m not microwaving in plastic ,  great set . 
i recently purchased this item and love it !  the new cast iron that is already seasoned is awesome . 
it works great for chopping ,  slicing ,  and feels great in your hands while doing it . 
i would recommend but takes practice on an older knife to get the hang of it . 
i had to fully remove my case in order to use the charging station . 
however i wasn t a big fan of the thickness it provides for my phone . 
delivery timethe product arrived at my door within two days with amazon prime shipping . 
i m no expert ,  but these things came very close to being distortion free at high volume . 
also ,  my samsung galaxy num_extend is a little heavy ,  so it was swinging when i took corners . 
i wasn t sure if my over dial was actually giving me the temperature i was setting it for . 
if already bent i would give five stars but i do recommend this set and will probably buy another . 
this pitcher has a sturdy feel to it and looks nice on the table . 
this is a good ,  standard piece of kitchen equipment . 
if it was one solid mold with no chance of detaching i would give it five stars . 
i recommend this to anyone who uses a faucet water filter . 
i have used a lot of bread machines with good results ,  . 
glad i stopped long enough to buy when i did arrive . 
after less than num_num weeks of usage ,  that square is starting to wear off . 
the motorola oasis bluetooth is part of their new productivity series . 
i ve used this product for about a year . 
i spill screws when doing picture framing jobs . 
i love the side pocket for the manual . 
only a very small number of kernels didn t pop . 
the grips help keep the tongs from slipping while the heads are easy on your pans and food . 
it s also really pretty ,  which is a nice bonus . 
gives me great results ,  but again better with the cuisinart pans than with the chicago metallics . 
however ,  sometimes the grass gets stuck in the beginning of the funnel . 
as for green power ,  it controls the num_extend data . 
great invention ,  wish i had thought of it ! deniselombard ,  il . 
i have owned a portable knife sharpener for my hiking and camping trips for many years now . 
when i was looking to purchase a new machine ,  i only was looking for a bunn . 
they re very sturdy and easy to put together . 
this roll along our metal shower rod without any issues . 
i ordered these to use in my polymer clay pieces . 
this is a decent adapter for the price . 
it is very easy to use and quick . 
with everyone recycling more and more i often worried about the sharp tuna fish can edges and the like . 
the ice ream mixture freezes in about num_num minutes and is as good as or better than store bought . 
i tried it with water to see how it was supposed to operate . 
i ve lost more than i have worn out . 
it tightens only to barely snug ,  the spins around again . 
some of the other brands are even hard to wipe off the screen but not this one . 
we ve had ours for nearly num_num years now . 
are you kidding me ?  for a penny i bought num_num of them just in case i tear one . 
one in orange and the other one in yellow  my husband and i use different brands of sweeteners  . 
so ,  even though it doesn t say you can do this it will be ok . 
until then i ll just go on being important on land . 
it s absolutely ridiculous that people spend hundreds and even thousands on grills . 
and i have an num_extend and the num_extend has a big battery . 
i noticed the newest jawbone headset comes with eargels that look just like these . 
the battery charged quickly and seems to work perfectly ,  and the price was great . 
the main stem appeared to warp a bit after in the dishwasher ,  but seems okay now . 
nice thick heavy duty bowl ,  perfect for soup ,  candy bowl or a variety of uses . 
i wish the charger had a lower profile . 
make sure you do the baby powder trick to remove oil slick look from screen protector . 
i have been using the product for about four years now . 
i haven t tried more than one clove yet but it works like a charm with one . 
there is one exposed screw on the back of the lifter that fine tunes the blade clearance . 
scrolling through pages on the num_extend was a nightmare . 
the rug doctor doesn t have any hand tools and it s clunky to move around . 
the crema ,  foam with a creamy texture is textbook perfect . 
the new trent customer service folks are very helpful and can answer just about any question you may have . 
it has never fallen out ,  but it s something i watch when it s being used . 
i bought these two thanksgivings ago ,  and haven t put them down since . 
it s solid wood and a beautiful dark wood walnut finish . 
which is fine but just something some people may want to know . 
i will still use them just not for beating something ,  as they are not very deep . 
these are the original accessories that came with the second gen palm pre phones . 
a great price and the colors are bright . 
even if stored in a kitchen drawer ,  the tongs are spread out and get tangled with other utensils . 
love using this for frying okra and fries . 
i would highly recommend it if it s the right size for your space . 
i like this knife for boning chicken ,  but i think i should have gone with the flexible version . 
i originally wanted to get the large ,  but didn t because of storage space constraints in my tiny kitchen . 
somehow things that needed to be made in large batches did not require a fine pot . 
she told me to just buy the expensive press . 
as soon as we saw this on sale at amazon ,  immediately purchased it . 
i would buy this num_extend months of use . 
this is probably the best i can get . 
i would highly recommend this armband not to mention it was shipped quickly . 
this is a plastic tub for the sink . 
good price for the can ,  it was kind of small but does hold a lot . 
i highly recommend this juicer with a num_num yr warranty  i believe it s num_extend
i love the oxo products for starting my kitchen as newly divorced male . 
i then added celery and a bit of peeled ginger . 
now if only it were possible to get rid of my keys !  recommended . 
he had this mug and used it for almost a decade . 
i am so late to review this ,  hopefully it does help someone else . 
use it mainly for hash browns and zuchini bread . 
got burned bad with a generic a while back . 
i also needed to be able to pair with my cellphone and my wife s . 
i d never buy an ultra cheap car charger for my expensive iphone . 
highly recommended ,  even from someone who swears by the littlest vornado  aka the tiny tornado !   ,  another fine little fan . 
this is made to last and will be the last flipper you ever have to buy . 
this does the job plus offers the option to charge two  like ipad and iphone  at the same time . 
and ,  be sure to let the cake cool upright in the pan for num_num minutes before unmolding . 
i use this while driving ,  but the bluetooth is not always on my ear . 
if you like poached eggs the easy way with little effort ,  you will love this . 
this product works great ,  i used it to open a smart phone in order to change the battery . 
i have no cleaning issues with the nordic ware pan . 
america  do not supply a coffeemaker in the room . 
it is heavy ,  weighing in at around seven pounds . 
murphy s law is always waiting for anyone in a hurry . 
the black belt clip has been missing for a year or so . 
as for for my cookware ,  i do not wash mine . 
it provides good access to all buttons ,  ports and functions including the touch screen . 
all my counter top appliances are red and i wanted that ,  but didn t want to sacrifice quality for it . 
slow shipping though ,  since it comes from china . 
to me it makes sense to do what i need to in order to keep it sharp . 
plantronics includes an ac adapter and a separate usb cable . 
this oil is very thin and therefore sinks right into the wood . 
it often freezes while doing the simplest things like turning or switching menus . 
my new hobby is baking cookies and having space to cool all the varieties is limited . 
i ve always used plantronics ,  so i have nothing to compare it to . 
the android device does a wonderful with the gps . 
the thermometer turns out properly cooked meat and is quite satisfactory . 
i purchased the sand color for more formal dining . 
i haven t got a single scratch on it and i assume it s hard material . 
i have trusted otterbox with multiple phones personally and within my family . 
the size of the product is about the size of a credit card and it is very slim . 
better for the environment than all the packaging that goes with microwave popcorn . 
i would place this kit on the top five list of chargers for your apple mobile products . 
comes with multiple charger ends for different devices . 
i m impressed with how easy this was to put together ,  and how nice it looks . 
timing length of phone calls ,  reminder of a task num_num or num_num minuets hence . 
break the eggs into the cups ,  then insert them into the holder when the water is ready . 
but i also have a lot of attachments . 
the bionic will attempt to  color  the water a little ,  destroying the moment somewhat . 
i mainly use this as a dutch oven and a chili pot . 
i ve tried cheap ones ,  and even some pricey ones ,  and they re all the same . 
the handle is a good grip for me ,  and feels comfortable . 
very visible forcing me to put dishes up after they air dry . 
i love the silver color and it blends well with the white apple iphone num_extend my daughter have . 
a surprise is that it takes more veggies or fruits to create a certain amount of juice . 
love the chameleon ,  but beware that the colors are much darker than the pictures show . 
it does work but i have had it fall several times . 
the iphone num_extend num_num and num_extend only has a num_extend inch screen . 
one reviewer complained about the rough surface holding onto some of the ground powder . 
i tossed out all my plastic junk and decided just to use pyrex products for storage and baking . 
i just bought this phone after the keys kept sticking on my curve . 
i purchased this four months ago to use with my samsung galaxy num_extend
it s been about three months and the only problems so far were due to boneheadedness . 
it actually comes out of its little hole all the time . 
this fit right into the space without causing any problems . 
we have worn out three of these fantastic coffee makers . 
that is to have a slightly  off  taste . 
nice stylus that works well .  .  . not extra large but not too small either . 
the ensures faster freezing time and smaller ice crystals ,  which equals a smooth ,  creamy texture in the finished product . 
one dispenses liquid dish soap that i buy in bulk quantities and i then use to wash my eyeglasses . 
definitely throw it in the tub while you fill it up to soften it up . 
i only use a local ,  nonorganic  but rbst free  brand now ,  and it always works perfectly . 
well ,  the whole pesto popcorn popper does work well . 
on top of that ,  its only $ a month . 
it s rich and full of flavor without being bitter . 
i have just now ordered my third cheese maker like the one listed above . 
it s brew cycle is super quiet and it provides a helpful ding when the coffee is done . 
very sleek ,  almost looks like the iphone has no case . 
i searched the many stores in philadelphia that might carry one but found none . 
the heat is distributed so well and things look and taste great after cooking in these pans and pots . 
after a little while i tried it in my left ear and it sounded really good . 
i used to microwave my potatoes briefly ,  and then throw them in the oven for num_num minutes or so . 
i like this one because you don t have the bottom piece to remove before you grind the pepper . 
it is also tricky to sharpen any small blade like that in a folding knife . 
we have had quite a few droids and iphone ,  usually they come with a screen wipes . 
i like the screen size ,  camera ,  and controls . 
teachers have been out with flu ,  num_extend colds or something or other . 
gave this a num_num star because they are pretty flimsy but what do you expect for the price . 
i am very pleased with this product so far . 
 still using silpat or parchment paper cause i like to .   . 
pop the bottom off and slide it right up and over the phone . 
this is the fifth nokia phone and the fourth nokia smartphone that i have owned . 
sometimes takes a little bit of effort ,  but it eventually gets everything off . 
this is great for maqking tacos and i plan to use it for mini desserts . 
as a firefighter i come in contact with extremes ,  heat ,  cold ,  water ,  and impact . 
i like this design because it s more sturdy than other designs . 
so we decided to purchase one for ourselves . 
i also purchased egg rings that i love . 
thankfully ,  the num_extend came with software to sync with outlook . 
you should be able to find these for closer to one hundred dollars however . 
i highly recommend this product for anyone who s serious about making great salads . 
its perfect for someone who only drinks a cup every here and there . 
i bought one for myself and one for my best friend . 
i have other farberware pans that i have used for years and still look good and cook good too . 
this is easy to clean and whips everything wonderfully well ,  even potatoes . 
hopefully ,  otterbox beefed up that clip for the iphone num_num and num_num series . 
i will be sure to update the review if anything changes . 
one caveat :  do not put this in the dishwasher if you can avoid it . 
this is small enough we can use the adjacent outlets without many problems . 
i finally purchased one and am glad to have this charger . 
micro usb is the new standard in cellular devices now and the bold num_num has it . 
i hand wash them and dry them right away . 
i ve bought this measuring cup at several different apartments i ve lived in . 
this usb car charger works well on it . 
the diamond i must say shocked me ,  it went on fairly easy like the anti fingerprint bubble free . 
it takes several minutes to get hot enough to start cooking . 
then boom ,  it s fresh for num_num weeks or more . 
my wife really likes this and has it packed to the gills . 
it seems every day i find something new it can do . 
it is very light ,  comes with a little pouch and i keep charged in my purse . 
i would eat it everyday if i could ,  and this is my favorite popcorn popper . 
anyway ,  that usb cable is the only connection needed to the dock ,  cleaning up the look . 
so far we are very happy with this purchase . 
i always have a little stick vac on hand for small and quick jobs . 
it s something my father needed to replace in his droid x . 
it s just the right size for my small area and i love it . 
all of my  out of the way  places are clean . 
this item only fits certain models ,  so make sure you order the correct one . 
i ve had mine for at least over num_num years and still looks new . 
fits in my drawers perfectly and allows me to see everything at a glance . 
i used it to transfer files from my emails on my phone to my usb drive . 
i bought num_num for num_num dollars one cost num_extend at t mobile ok and they sound great . 
there was no indication that it had no flat bottom . 
the case is also very hard to remove . 
the rim also allows the bowl to be passed even if the contents are quite warm . 
great for grinding flax seeds ,  don t use it for coffee beans . 
i have purchased num_num of these and recommended them to num_num other family members . 
unfortunately ,  this num_extend mah battery is actually a num_extend mah battery . 
this is the first one that we had found that we both liked the look of . 
i saw a set of these in a restaurant on a sunday morning . 
we ve had ours for quite some time and it s still good . 
comes with num_num screen protectors ,  a cleaning wipe and a smoothing card ,  which i found very helpful . 
num_num large and num_num regular for each ear . 
the temp can be slightly flexible ,  just can t be too cold or too hot . 
this pan worms up quicker than ordinary ,  very glad to have bought this . 
the more you use it ,  the more seasoned it becomes and food barely sticks . 
easy to use ,  once you adjust the amount of coffee and the brew time to your liking . 
the fact that it s num_extend means this is not some wimpy power block . 
it makes it much bulkier to handle and doesn t easily fit in pants pocket . 
no creepy coating is ever going to come off in the food . 
apple should really include longer cords with their products ,  but in the meantime ,  this one for num_extend is great . 
i almost decided to pass after reading about the flimsy handles . 
this was simple and actually made me num_extend
i am glad i ordered the tiles because they are easy to handle and clean . 
it slices onions up into delicious thing round circles . update :  july num_num num_num i use it all the time . 
all of these problems can be fixed by a firmware update . 
i ve had this for years now ,  it isn t as shiny as it once was but it steams nicely . 
reliability ,  functionality over bass ?  i ll buy or recommend the num_extend with no doubt . 
wipe screen down with mild cleaner and paper towel ,  i used diluted simple green . 
we used one of these while in italy and fell in love with it . 
i will keep it since it is easy storage . 
i can t think of anything negative about it at all . 
i m not an electronic whiz by any means . 
nothing more to say about this awesome thermometer  had to get the min word count  :   . 
everything is easier on this product ,  but not dealing with a bladder system is my favorite feature . 
this was a great replacement at an even better price . 
this is a quality holster and i got very prompt delivery . 
i ordered this so i could benefit from a deeper water level in my bath tub . 
i lay a dishtowel over the top in case there is any spluttering . 
you will get a lot more fluid with practice ,  if you have this issue . 
take everyone s advice on seasoning it ,  and you will have a pan for a lifetime . 
easy to hold in my small hand and the bristles are still good after hundreds of potatoes . 
the suction option works well ,  the phone is secure in the cradle . 
it s pretty expensive ,  but it s well made and i ve never seen a broken one . 
it s amazing ,  will change your life ,  and of course save you a tonne of time on your cooking . 
the unit itself adjusts or it comes with extra tabs that are longer . 
much better than holding my iphone or trying to jog with the iphone in your running shorts . 
the images online do not do this case justice . 
the air bubble will go down the side and the bottle will not break . 
it s made well ,  cooks well and easy to use and clean . 
they used a high quality brushed aluminum that holds my iphone in a very usable angle . 
don t stick it in the dishwasher ,  don t run water on it if you want it to last . 
it is a sprint product , i was scared its not gonna work with sim card but it did . 
the phone quickly detected it and identified it as num_extend and automatically connected num_extend
i paid half price ,  though % or % off sales are more common . 
i have made crepes on about num_num different pans; none have impressed me . 
otterbox commuter cases are very durable and great for everyone especially guys . 
to all who say the wood cracks ,  take it easy !  went together perfectly . 
i used this cake mold in conjunction with a cinderella cake topper found on amazon . 
it is a good buy if you own a whipper . 
the shamrock color is beautiful and would go well with most summer themes as well as the winter holidays . 
the construction appears very sturdy and high quality . 
fresh hot loaf in less than an hour !  . 
he was pleasant ,  but still refused to help much . 
i seem to come back to this grinder no matter what others i ve tried . 
purchased as a gift ,  this item came quickly . 
i am the biggest battery life mizer i know ,  and the tbolt has reportedly horrible battery life . 
i have had the num_num kitchenaid food processor for about a month now . 
when i sautee onions or other sticky foods ,  i just add some oil ,  and i m good to go . 
i ve had it for some time now and no chips . 
my first press and wonder what took me so long to get one . 
i am completely satisfied with the cuisinart chef s classic stainless cookware . 
i ve gotten many months of use from this case . 
it looks cheap and like it wouldn t fit well on the ipad . 
i always felt the enviro cleaned well but it did not leave the tile shiny like the bissell does . 
she used it today ,  and she was so excited . 
what i can say about the juicers are num_extend
voice quality and noise cancelling is by far the best . i m lovin  it !  !  !  . 
the phone part broke ,  and i had to fix it with a rubber band . 
i love the gold filter and how it makes my coffee taste . 
put it on your weber kettle or weber smokey mountain for a smokey grilled pizza . 
just make sure it s the right one for your model of vacuum cleaner . 
i purchased this after reading an article in cook s illustrated ,  which gave it a  recommended  rating . 
the ac adapter part is different from the picture ,  but it is an oem charger . 
haven t had this for long but amazingly sharp ,  handle feels great . 
it would be helpful to have a good ,  strong plastic sleeve to put over the cutting blades . 
i though three people have reviewed this and they all have the same problem ,  something must be wrong . 
the spout is has some form to it and it makes pouring real easy . 
pizzazz s forced air causes the moisture to evaporate . 
i highly recommend this cover for anyone who loves pink and wants protection for their iphone . 
bought tool kit to do a battery upgrade on my cell phone . 
next was a sunbeam of modest price but high rating . 
i ve owned this for close to a year and it looks like new . 
pavina glasses and you could not ask for a better combination . 
it was a bit tricky to get on so i m just hoping i never have to take it off . 
i have heavy iron deposits in my water . 
but the tongs needed special use or they would scratch the expensive  all clad  pots and pans . 
but to be fair ,  i bought the other model without a handle which acts as a catch tray . 
personally ,  i think it makes a big difference . 
if you don t use them it s fine if so don t buy this . 
not suitable for children unless it s on a flat stable surface . 
very handy as i use it for most all my home usb charging needs . 
i will check back if we have any issues with them in the future . 
because of the price and fat in heavy whipping cream ,  i use part half and half . 
good protection and yeah yeah yeah yeah ueah ueah yeh ueah yeah . 
you have to be ultra careful with the plastic top when tightening it to ensure it does not crack . 
it does the job ,  cleanly ,  neatly and quickly . 
i can only guess they are not using farberware pots and pans . 
i am slowly replacing plastic containers with glass ,  especially to take to work and heat leftovers in the microwave . 
i got it for use with the mytouch num_extend and it appears to work just fine . 
worked well when i couldn t plug my cord into my phone . 
it s heavy ,  so i don t have to worry about it tipping . 
for an inexpensive set this comes out quite nicely . 
have used this cheese maker for six years and have never had a problem . 
got a lot of jealous looks from other tourists wishing they had one to charge their phones . 
easy to change the filters and it moves a good volume of air . 
a bit of time . overall i recommend this product . 
works great for a thin lipped jar but won t sit on the edge of a thick coffee cup . 
this new surface will readily release food when you clean it . 
i needed seven more words to complete this review . 
what i like about this cooker is the smaller size just great for two people . 
took this on a trip to japan with me . 
particularly now in the dry cold winter when hands tend to be dry and  not so tacky  . 
i liked that i have the controls right above my head . 
it functions well and was easily packaged for immediate use . 
texans love their barbeque and i m no exception . 
as the title says ,  these headphones do not work well with a macbook pro . 
but then after a couple of times using it ,  the latches worked fantastic and easy . 
the picture and the description indicate that labels will be included but our arrived with non . 
i need to pulverize dog pills for some of my canines who can smell a benadryl num_num rooms away . 
for some $ a year i certainly wouldn t get upset if i had to replace it after three years . 
the quality is good and it looks great if you like to display your kitchen accessories . 
but the speaker in the unit is plenty loud enough on its own . 
you get num_num different sizes which is awesome . 
so i plan my food preparation around the processor . 
unable to control my dribble ,  would i soon lose wife ,  home ,  all i had ? this coffee maker solved the problem . 
on the other hand ,  they store easily and clean up easily as well . 
you can tell that speaker audio was clearly considered in the design of the device . 
i had a positive experience with this seller !  !  my coaster holder arrived in a timely manner . 
work as good as the one that came with my phone . 
with the strips ,  the cake comes out even and makes the finished case look very professional . 
i got this for my wife and she loves it . 
i also wanted something that wasn t too heavy to lug around . 
this little simple incubator is great for making regular yogurt . 
i have gone through many stick vacs over the years . 
i had no problem with it but i could see a smaller person struggling with the weight . 
it s worked perfectly since then and now my workload is much ,  much less when we have fries  :   . 
this is upsetting since the price is about the same for the ones i used to get . 
they really lasted well; however ,  i like these rectangular ones better . 
i will never buy any other brand but circulon; it is sooo worth the money !  . 
absolutely love this phone case !  !  covers the front and back for added protection . 
hopefully ,  this brew  n go will last the next num_num years !  . 
but supposedly ,  num_num to num_num for water temp is optimal . 
if you re looking to get a mixer ,  look no further . 
for calls ,  the left headphone becomes the ear piece and the right doubles as the mic . 
of course this has nothing to do with lodge . 
we are still getting a feel for seasoning . 
the way i installed it allowed for the window to be closed without taking down this fan . 
no leaks ,  and even after leaving tomato sauce in the like in it for several hours ,  no stains . 
now i can clip my iphone to my purse or a belt loop . 
just toss in whatever it is you want processed and away this sucker goes . 
i found it to be well designed ,  slim yet rugged enough for the everyday use my phone endures . 
have used them in the micro ,  holds up to the test . 
i doubt if cake mix or brownie mix would work in the microwave . 
i would purchase again ,  and may purchase another one if i start baking in larger quantities . 
they are nice looking and store a lot of vinyl . 
i didn t know why the top was open; thought it was broke . 
however ,  like a picture frame ,  the frame to  screen  surface feels like couple of millimeter in depth . 
it is a bigger size which is exactly what i needed . 
no longer do i have to catch spices when i open a kitchen cabinet . 
i also purchased the num_num quart serving bowl . 
bluetooth transfers to samsung , nokia phones runs at num_extend while it s a consistent num_extend for sony ericsson phones . 
it isn t meant for the commute to work but is great around the house ,  yard ,  and at work . 
they clean up great and take up little to no room in my confections tool box . 
they were the perfect length and sturdy enough to hold the toppers in place . 
the sound is outstanding and your able to here others without have to turn them down . 
the background apps would drain the battery even when not in use . 
so ,  i looked all over to find something affordable ,  without the hastle of a expensive take from a wallet . 
i say that because it fits sung ,  looks cute and does not make the phone heavy . 
we have made bread from mixes and from scratch ,  plain and varied ,  and it all works . 
it does not come off at all ,  over rough bumps or uneven pavement . 
this was given as a gift and they loved it !  !  very comfortable to hold . 
you could purchase four of them for about $ each and change ,  including shipping . 
for a single purpose opener ,  however ,  this opener is perfect . 
i love it and it makes great bread !  i do have minor complaints . 
i wish it used photo cells for power ,  but the battery seems to last a long time . 
wish i could bake everything in this but it s better to avoid overly acidic ingredients . 
the suction style for the window holds well and it fits basically any phone !  it s pretty cool really . 
works like a charm at spinning out water on lettuce . 
i d buy a good $ pot and another grinder and do it myself . 
two cases in particular ,  one thick ,  and one thin ,  both did not do so well . 
i really enjoyed the mirrored look to my iphone . 
i bought the jiffy based on other reviews and started to use it . 
i used it to scrub my wok ,  after it cooled down of course . 
the stone is very absorbent and it doesn t soak through to the table . 
it fits perfectly snug and seems to be a nice case . 
ah the display it is hard to see in anything but bright light ,  but that is a minor flaw . 
no tiny hole or anything so you re getting very clear ,  filtered coffee . 
let it set for a minute or two and then pour some water through it . 
i love this measuring cup !  it s so easy to use and pour . 
bought this for my parents for part of their christmas present . 
do keep in mind that you need to use low heat . 
if you want a decent pda get a decent pda . 
i love them !  they are a bit cumbersome for small children to handle ,  otherwise i have no complaints . 
i ordered it on a thursday and it arrived tues after ,  super fast . 
they work great with phone more so than others i have tried . 
plus ,  they do stack and help to save on space . 
phone number right on install form !  how about that ?  . 
we always buy or food saver products from amazon . 
the prongs that go on the positive and negative are movable ,  so they fit any size in that capacity . 
they seem to be of pretty good quality and sturdy . 
i love the stainless blade and it is so sharp . 
i can t believe some of the reviews that say it needs to be charged every day . 
bought it on sale and i m just quite happy that my carpet looks so clean . 
they completely block the glare and are very smooth when using the phone . 
i use num_num small tea bags or num_num of the new larger kind for my tea . 
i however have some issues . the maximum ring volume is not loud . 
since then i have found many other uses for it and am thrilled with the purchase . 
i used this and then slice the apples into rings .  .  . my kids love it . 
i used it for making my own tomato sauce and it did a good job . 
this case was really nice to hold and was really pleasing to the touch . 
the downside is that like any wallet it will tear if you overstuff it . 
just simple cut down the middle and you will have two identical filters that resemble the oem filer . 
it takes up counter space ,  about the size of typical waffle num_extend
ill tell you right now though .  .  . if you dont like large silverwear then you better steer clear of this set . 
the lid is also easy to put on . 
the belt clip absolutely sucks ,  and i no longer even try to use it . 
my first review was not very good for these chargers . 
it is a nice leather cover and seems to be well made . 
this is the best headset i have used ,  though i m not a headset person . 
this works great ,  and keeps the lettuce really crisp for a long time . 
they are easy to handle and wash ,  look great ,  and are nicely balanced . 
it has a magnetic clasp that secures the phone over the top . 
its great as a lunchbox and he can play with it . 
been like a yr and they re still going . 
i just started canning about a year ago and unfortunately i don t have the time to do it often . 
this is a great product ,  really fits perfect . 
well made just as presto has been making products for so very many years . 
the blade also fits on loosely but this is by design and not a flaw . 
it keeps the tea nice and hot and the mug is pleasant to hold and has great capacity . 
what i can t live with ,  is num_extend out of my pocket . 
the terminals are adjustable ,  but it seems odd you can move the spacers where you want it . 
when i was in juice diet kick last year ,  i ve ordered this one and omega num_num masticating juicer . 
my wife hates it for that very reason ,  but i love it . 
use them on my xoom tablet ,  nexus num_num tablet ,  and evo phone . 
i tought i was going to have to give up on cornbread baked in cast iron . 
of them all ,  i find this little num_num qt mini dutch oven to be particularly useful . 
like a lot of customers ,  i had a hard time figuring out which replacement beaker to order . 
i couldn t believe the price of this humongos piece of calphalon . 
it was something i found very useful and i miss it . 
i bought this one for my daughter as a wedding gift . 
stuff doesn t stick if these are seasoned properly . 
you don t need to remember the shape per se . 
you can t go wrong buying from either line . 
i have taken the bottom of a few times and it doesnt seem to be too loose . 
i like to no nonsense buttons of  on  and  off  . 
i ordered this based on the reviews ,  and once again the reviews have not let me down . 
i think it will last a long long time . 
i am able to pop my waffle loose with a fork . 
the hoover steamvac carpet cleaner did and excellent job of cleaning carpeting and even tile floor . 
also it is all plastic ,  so i don t know about longevity . 
yes ,  it knocks the grinds hanging from the machine all over the place when you pull it out . 
it s comfortable to wear ,  it s easy to hear ,  the other person hears me . 
i use a lot of garlic and have tried various types of tools for it . 
when our filter starts smelling dirty ,  these replacements really do a great job of cleaning the air . 
bought for my wife ,  i didn t know battery was going to be so large . 
i ve tested it against the weights on meat packs from the butcher and it s accurate . 
i m excited and i know this is something i can do . 
i expected a little more from this pillow . 
i don t bother using the little base but chop on a cutting board . 
this was the second global knife i ever bought . 
comes with a little scoop that works well ,  too . 
but i have about num_num paper basket filters left from my old mr . 
this is my first upright  dyson num_extend slim  . 
i have dropped my phone a bunch of times and nothing has happened to it . 
they scraped right off with a wooden spatula . 
i use the medium bowl all the time . 
wish i had known about this thing before !  . 
i like to grind my own meat at home . 
the dinnerware has been washed in the dishwasher too many times to count and come out looking fantastic . 
first ,  the fm transmitter ,  just did not seem practical . 
everyone wants this case and i tell them where to buy it . 
jar as the seventh one to help with the tight fit . 
mist the dough with water as soon as it is placed in the oven to get the oven num_extend
tomatos are one of the classic tests of your knives and this knife cuts beautifully through fresh tomatoes . 
well i charged it up and tested it out and the incoming audio was fantastic . 
when it s time to flip the eggs ,  i swivel the ring a little and it comes right off . 
it appears to be good quality ,  the edges are not sharp ,  everything seems to be done well . 
only downfall is make sure that once you find a place for the mixers ,  you leave it there . 
it arrived completely assembled and sturdy as could be . 
she can t break these ,  even on hardwood floors !  plus ,  since we have limited cupboard space ,  these are great . 
the peels are thin and sleek and make perfect treats for the chickens and guineas . 
wow !  this car charger is great for a super great price . 
does a good job of slicing most any texture of cheese . 
using the foodsaver bottle stoppers has changed that . 
i ve tried many different waffle irons over the years and this ,  by far ,  is the best one . 
first pot i ve found in a loooong time that lives up to the hoopla . 
surprisingly nice finish to it that leads you to believe it was far more expensive than it was . 
it is just that without them ,  nothing works . 
the apple bumper case is nice but the open back leaves a lot of glass exposed . 
are the henckels more difficult to sharpen ?  yes . 
i bought this external battery charger after reading numerous reviews on here . 
the ipad reached a % battery life before the itorch ran out of gas . 
the lid comes off easily by turning the inner dial counterclockwise and lifting off . 
ive been decorating cakes for fun for a few years now . 
ok ,  so that s the best stuff about it . 
i also own a cutco chef s knife that i received as a gift almost num_num yrs ago . 
this blender has an exceptional amount of power in the base . 
this is just my favorite for shredding cheese to veggies and slicing radishes and carrots and potatoes . 
i like the smooth design and thick base . 
a perfect gift for someone who uses a couch for coats . 
very easy and now i don t have to go off the headset to answer a cell call . 
i don t like the power button it should be a switch . only negative so far is the usb cable . 
i tried another rice cooker first  aroma brand  . 
tiny garbage can is best in small bathroom . 
i didn t know what to expect from a brand name i d never heard of ,   kinivo  . 
i actually bought this as a travel charger for my samsung galaxy note num_extend num_extend
one of the reasons i first tried calphalon is for the price . 
heavy on your ears but still stable enough to stay in . 
it is good quality for the price and i like having stainless steel . 
great price ,  but they will not look new for more then a few years . 
i also use the jabra easygo when i m driving my num_num saturn . 
there is a $ premium for the num_extend though . so far i am enjoying this phone . 
phone works ok to call ,  the keyboard is great with my little fingers so texting is a breeze . 
i had always liked my ikea frother ,  but this one is so much better . 
compared to other similar products this is superior . 
i have used these since we became droid owners . 
luckily ,  i have a charging port in my middle storage cubby so i can shut away the light . 
i do actually like the  good grip  on these . 
it works and is really easy to remove and replace in any part of the car board . 
both seem to come out flavorful and hot . worth every penny we paid for it !  !  . 
they fit our i phones num_extend like a glove . 
i have tried other soaps ,  they seem to make lots of bubbles . 
they were not too difficult to assemble and arrived in great shape . 
i use this headset in conjunction with the sony bluetooth adapter previously reviewed . 
now i need to find a holder for this thing ,  it s too cool looking to go into a drawer . 
they don t leak ,  easy to wash ,  no any hidden places where the food would gather and spoil . 
it has a strainer lid and the stainless steel never ever tarnishes . 
the port holes are all there ,  and they line up perfectly !  love it !  . 
after becoming more familiar with the press ,  things go a lot faster . 
i can t imagine a canner being more solidly built . 
sorry just filling up space to put my review in . 
i have no idea if this is a real motorola product or a great copy . 
fingers swipe across the screen just as smoothly as when it s naked glass . 
with each successive use ,  this pan gets better and better . 
i got this to replace my expensive dress bags from container store . 
it s even compatible with the evo num_extend despite the name saying evo num_extend
they will probably last a long long time . they are more likely to be lost than ever wear out . 
however ,  choose carefully as they are not all alike . 
these are totally worth splurging on whether you bake sometimes or weekly . 
it would be best if the lid were made of metal . 
as long as you do not lose them ,  you will have them forever . 
four huge suction cups keep everything securely fastened to the wall . 
it flips eggs well too if you ve got stainless steel pans . 
they don t stain for dark foods as long as i put them in the dishwasher . 
and i love how the different sizes are ideal for the things i need to use mixing bowls for !  . 
the bissell fills the dirt cup when you could swear your carpet was already clean . 
i rode some laps around the track while video taping . 
loved this while it was working on phone . 
i tried this pillow because of the comments from other people who had purchased and used it . 
comes with two protectors ,  a cleaning cloth and an alcohol wipe to prep the screen . 
the removable top and bottom plates are awesome for cleaning . 
incredible price compared to the $ verizon and rim ask for accessories . 
lasted a long time and has since been retired . 
for us to get our food medium or med . 
the mixer does not come with a dough num_extend
i realized that i didn t have any bread maker yeast . 
it holds num_num tablespoons of dough which comes out to be about a rounded tablespoon . 
the battery life is much longer than the tired stock batteries they replaced . 
this minor flaw would probably keep me from buying another one if i had any considerations other than price . 
so i can t comment on that till i use them . 
after that ,  clean the screen with a good screen cleaner . 
feels really nice in my hand ,  and i would totally recommend it to my friends !  . 
it holds the bluetooth and the extra hooks and earplugs . 
perfect size addition to my num_num cup cuisinart food processor . 
this gel is by far the best design i have come across . 
these are very nice shower curtain rings and they move easily along the curtain rod . 
chicago is great knives for the dollar spent . 
probably was on a sticker i removed . worked great for a double boiler which was intended use . recommend . 
it took a little while to receive it but it was worth the wait . 
that is just a clever marketing ploy  i . e . 
just what i needed for my new blackberry storm num_extend
you can plug this cable into your computer or any other usb charger you have . 
this new one is all of that and more . 
i wanted a removeable water container so i didn t have to fill with the pot . 
i use this pan for more than i bought it for  which was just for frying eggs  . 
if i had a complaint it would be that it s a tad small . 
this stool is very solid and very easy to put together . 
after researching a bunch of spinners i settled on this one because of the reviews . 
the best part about the french press is that you don t have to make more than you need . 
what else can i say ? it does what it was designed to do . 
it arrived quickly ,  in a tube ,  not laminated . 
of all the coffee makers owned over the years this one does the best job by far . 
and the shun ,  once again ,  is not serrated . 
perhaps you would like one for your friend . 
never use dish detergent or put it in the dishwasher . 
my suggestion is if orange when being recharged ,  recharge for num_num hours . 
i bought this to make mini breads and works great . 
they should be advertised as herb snippers ,  similar to the shun herb shears num_extend
but the main reason i bought it was for the orange color . 
it is accompanied with a screen protector to keep fingerprints and light scratches off of the device . 
this is a great easy to use coffee grinder . 
i would recommend this product based on performance to date . an update to my first review . 
belt on my shark hand vac broke and i had a difficult time finding a replacement readily in stores . 
heavy duty measuring cups made from stainless steel . 
they are small ,  so they don t take up much space in the cabinet . 
it has always been just out of reach . 
both chargers also work well with other devices that charge through the usb port . 
they re super light and wonderfully comfortable . i can t recommend these enough . 
perfect size for me and a huge upgrade from my plastic ones . 
my screen is nice and bright white no greenish hue . 
also ,  this screen protector is thicker than others  but looks fine  . 
i bought this so that i could listen to an announcer on my radio while attending football games . 
big mistake as the newer one seem to havea very fragile mechanism . 
my ancient littonware gave up the ghost ,  so i went with this one mainly for its size . 
the power time is double a standard battery . 
i have no doubt that i could easily be using this num_num years down the road . 
i love iron skillets ,  i ve used them during the college years . 
however ,  other than that ,  a pretty good car mount . 
i also have a num_num cup angled measuring cup as well .  .  .  . and again it makes measuring so much easier . 
this can opener is well worth spending a little extra money for . 
i ve used others and they don t work nearly as well . 
great product with num_num years of proven performance behind it . 
when i ve had this one on long enough i ll give it another go . 
but ,  i really liked how this turned out . 
in february ,  an onyx black kitchenaid artisan stand mixer joined its cousin the kitchenaid food processor in my kitchen . 
this is an excellent example of what i consider great american craftsmanship . 
but ,  after owning my dyson for a single day i can already say that i am completely in love . 
it is quick and very good .  . thanks for a product that does what it is advertised to do . 
that one had foam pads to grab the phone and seemed much flimsier . 
good grips utensils have always been one of my favorites because of the large comfortable handles . 
would recommend to anyone who wants a good sturdy case ,  but is not too bulky at the same time . 
buttons are easy to get to with no trouble at all . 
and this one will easily last longer than one winter if filtered water is used . 
it feels secure in your hand and it has done a good job so far . 
place them in the press with the cut side against the grate . 
it is easy to adjust to open tall cans ,  and the removable lid lifter makes it easy to clean . 
i never worry about any damage to it ,  worth the expense to protect your device . 
they work just fine but i was hoping more because of the name . 
my husband and i ate almost the entire loaf ,  it was so good . 
you ll never be able to use instagram ,  pinterest or anything newer than facebook or twitter . 
i ve had this for over a year now . 
old and young alike enjoyed their salads in these nifty shells !  !  !  . 
order with this converter to be ready for anything . 
it heats evenly and quickly and the anodized surface makes it easy to work with and to clean . 
not bulky like some other cases and it seems to be sturdy . 
so i had been searching for another one for a long time . 
it can boil up to num_num eggs at a time and it can boil at soft ,  medium or hard . 
i ve started grinding the beans on the espresso setting of my grinder rather than the automatic drip setting . 
they are working on better instructions ,  but i love it just like i got it . 
yes ,  it may be a little heavier than the the cheap stuff ,  but this will last forever . 
using this on a num_extend and i m very happy with it . 
the cable doubles as a data cable as well not like some of the other chargers we have gotten . 
i like that the handle has a slide button that locks the lid on . 
pretty sure it isn t an official apple usb charger but it does the job . 
easy to use ,  stores nicely ,  cleans easily ,  pours reliably . 
i loved the price of this case and i love the soft edges  i . e . 
i also had plastic covering the outside of the unit . 
i ll fire it up tonight and add to my reviewif i find any problems . 
i also use them as ice packs for my kids when they have a boo boo . 
i will agree with other reviews that the weight due to the thickness makes it cumbersome . 
these are perfect ,  they bring all sizes and are very handy for anything . 
i ve always wanted one of these to keep my candy in . 
the price is not exhorbitant and the maintenance is very low . 
i first thought i didn t like it but after using a few times it was the best choice . 
they were as grease free as i ve ever seen without being over done . 
 :  added note num_num days later : still loving this coffee . 
roomba had been non stop working at least once a day somewhere in my house ,  maybe even twice . 
this item is of substantial build and high quality . 
this was a pleasant suprise that i was not expecting . 
i think most the reviews on here are just people who ve had negative experiences . 
i don t think you can find a better pair of speaker stands for this price . 
 i downloaded skyfire ,  a free browser ,  as an alternate because sometimes the standard browser does not display pages well  . 
it also provides a full amp to each port ,  which is great . 
someone splurged and got them for me for christmas . 
otherwise ,  it looks like a very nice butter keeper . 
the manual pile adjustment dial is easy enough to use and has seven height settings . 
save a little money here and use it on your christmas shopping . 
it doesn t read the temperature as fast as he d like but it works very well . 
since it s suppose to protect the screen from those i suppose it s natural that they show up somewhere . 
i think a hygiene purist might feel the need for a final fine mesh strain . 
i really got tired of purchasing store bought rotisserie chickens . 
i just tested to see if they were water tight ,  mine are . 
overall i like this adapter a lot and would consider it well made and a good value . 
it is also very easy to take out when the phone rings . 
picked it up a few weeks ago from a home depot . 
i ve been using this case for months already and i really like it . 
most recipes seem to be for larger bundt pans ,  so it was tricky . 
great battery right on par with the oem num_extend battery . 
i have it for my iphone num_extend and it works perfect . 
i wanted a can opener that did its job ,  but would look sleek and pretty in my kitchen . 
i hear these stones break all the time . 
this is better than using pam and other sprays . 
the bowl is very heavy and sturdy ,  and seems to be a handy size for storing or mixing . 
i asked a friend if could hear me ok after we finshed talking . 
don t turn aroundyour neck as much as the lg . 
you can choose your grind  fine to coarse  and grind from one cup to a pot full . 
although i did not expect this item to do as well as the professional ,  it does . 
last allot longer than some phone batteries we have purchased for other phones . 
i ve owned this phone now for about num_num months . 
toss it up in the top rack of the dishwasher to clean . it is a perfect kitchen accessory . 
another review complained about the bell and it is verydifficult to hear . 
very pleased with product and was surprised at how well it was made . 
this is the second otterbox we have to get for our num_extend in num_num months . 
just the right size for one or a few bites to share . 
i took a chance on this and i am very happy . 
the next function is the break to stop the spinner . 
this is a nice one to fill the spot it s designed to fill . 
this being said ,  it has held up well . 
will probably buy more of these in different colors !  . 
the cups are machine washable for easy cleaning and stackable for easy storage . 
originally i had intended to replace it with a different color . 
no fussing around with attach protocols like some troublesome bt headsets . 
this replaced my wife s defender series where the outer silicone shell had begun to tear and stretch . 
bought the arm band to go with so when i run or excerise i can clip it right on . 
my wife has to wear a tie ,   scarf  ,  every day to work . 
it s great for camping or in your kitchen ,  which is a bonus . 
but after i read online comments about the latter ,  i decided to pay extra and purchase the cuisinart . 
need less ,  or a finer grind ,  adjust the nut  knob ?   on top and you ve got it . 
i grew up watching the commercials for this product and just thought it was silly . 
it makes pizzelles fast and evenly with no sticking . 
i started with one and realized this is so much a better way to cook . 
if you had too much head motion ,  i m not sure how the grip would hold . 
the pause and serve feature is definately improved comared to other models . 
in either case ,  the edges are sharp enough to crack the shells efficiently . 
i have it for num_num months now ,  used it everyday and am very happy with it . 
as long as you treat the gasket with respect ,  like with any pressure cooker ,  the unit operates perfectly . 
i went a bit crazy with this little device !  i went through my entire pantry and sealed up everything . 
keep one in every room and in my purse . highly recommend . 
i had one of these when i was in china num_extend years  and it worked like a champ . 
it does have one month of gps included . 
this case fits easy and isn t too busy . 
i did read the reviews first and noticed that there were a lot of negative reviews . 
this was really blackberry s attempts at rivaling the iphone for sure . 
i find myself reaching for the forschner most of the time . 
unfortunately it does not have fm station preset memories . 
my onlt complaint is how difficult it is to take off . 
this is the best water filter you can buy to attach to the faucet . 
i like my coffee strong so i use four tablespoons for making about two and a half cups . 
i ve purchased three num_extend of these so far . 
very handy set for use with my ipod nano . 
i am very pleased because everything i need came in one package . 
i then add the appropriate amount of loose tea to the basket . 
they both work great . i like this one particularly for burgers cooked in a round pan . 
just take out ,  rinse and dry ,  and viola  you can use it again the next day . 
i cooked the base the night before and refrigerated it . 
these earphones are easy to insert ,  feel comfortable ,  and most important for me stay in place while i run . 
but it s big enough to hold a medium potato . 
we have been using these bunn filters in our mr . 
delivers on every regards a bluetooth headset is suppose to . 
it had a visible  path  on it and it cleaned it right up . 
i imagine it can take even more heat . 
this popper works pretty well if you don t put too much in it . 
it arrived as promised and it was in great shape . 
when i have used the procedure that lodge recommends ,  my cast iron has become gummy . 
it will probably be tight at first until it loosens up but it will work . 
combining dry and wet ingredients is easy by pouring into the supplied clear lid . 
it has a nice feel to it  not sticky or rubbery  . 
knife edge goes against fold so you can t cut yourself putting it in the case . 
i ve been using silk pillow cases for a long time . 
i have num_extend num_num and a whopping num_num inch skillet . 
after a day the tail became kind of loose and its doesn t really stick on well . 
that would be good for airborne rangers since they are always arriving from helicopters on fast ropes . 
this provides confirmation that the cooker is operating through sound . 
he says that it has already saved his phone from a couple of drops . 
i have had my nokia num_extend for almost three years now . 
this with a num_extend controller and some emulators and i have a very mobile gaming system . 
after some research ,  i settled on the speck candyshell grip case . 
it is just like the one i got with my android phone ,  so it works great . 
not bulky ,  stylish ,  very good protection and nice grip . 
this particular unlocked version seems thinner than the ones being sold by cell phone carriers . 
this has good capacity ,  and the sieve on top does work great . 
bigger than i could find at any local store . 
so in summary ,  the noise reduction is above average ,  comfort is excellent ,  and audio quality is excellent . 
the device is charged with the included usb cable . 
easy to use ,  makes a good cup of coffee . 
in fact i used it earlier today to slice potatoes and tested it out on tomatoes . 
i bought this to make and keep sun tea in . 
it is light ,  easy to put on and has a tight fit . 
yes ,  i was influenced by other reviews ,  but i didn t expect to ever love a fan . 
the mount has enough room for the phone only . 
outside of the odor i am also very happy with the honeywells and have had them over num_num years . 
we buy meat and fish on sale and vacumn seal it . 
i have been trying to keep my last one alive for a few years now . 
in fact ,  i found only one supplier on the web . 
i never bought the ricer for ricing potatoes . 
otherwise ,  anything that grills will cause some smoke . 
it s perfect protection for my phone plus also fits nicely in my holster . 
i think it s fun and easy to use . 
i am glad i made this purchase for my husband s iphone num_extend
of the several i own ,  this is my second favorite . 
i also use the containers as a sort of kitchen decoration on my steel kitchen shelves . 
will come apart for cleaning and sharpening ,  but not loose or rattily in every day use . 
over all ,  it works ,  and they do stand behind their product . 
the cover is well made ,  the color is nice and i m sure it will last for years to come . 
i love the style that fits into any decor . 
that way ,  they ll be crispy on the outside and just yummy on the inside . 
probably not worth the cost of trying to repair or ship it anywhere . 
this case is for ipod num_extend and it works great . 
i have yet to wear out the first two . 
this always entailed sticking my finger in a hot toaster or using a knife . 
this case protects this phone from many a fall i ve had . 
my daughter reports that the food is still warm ,  but not as hot as she would like . 
we had an old can opener that well ,  didn t open the cans as one would like . 
been over num_num months of daily use and its still not died on me . 
this headset fit great in my ear ,  its look is very cool ,  but a few num_extend
works as advertised for samsung galaxy num_extend cellphone . 
the cheapest i could find one for was $
you can t open it if it s under pressure because it has a lock by the handle  safety feature  . 
i can usually get num_extend full charges on my lumia num_extend
i ve never had any fires and even didn t properly tie the wings tight enough a few times . 
awesome !  work so well and are perfect for the cake deocrating enthusiast . 
so having that space at the top is ideal for our needs . 
once you use these you will find all sorts of excuses to buy additional pieces . 
but it didn t do any good whatsoever in terms of increasing the volume of steam coming out of it . 
i ve owned all kinds of different brands ,  and this one is simply the best . 
we will see about the longevity of the knife since this is only the first i ve used it . 
some people have said this product is too rigid . 
i don t like grinds in my coffee so save yourself a headache and get paper . 
i got this knife because it was recommended by cook s illustrated . 
meanwhile ,  the roaster handles are of course on the short sides . 
the metal cutters cut cleaner than plastic cutters and are easily stored once we re finished using them . 
do not try to slam the blade through the item all at one time . 
it never comes lose ,  even on rough streets and is easy to use . 
i purchased this product based on the reviews here at amazon . 
i love that the speaker wire is hidden in the pole and that the stands are simple and unobtrusive . 
i like to bake bread so that teaspoon one is a must !  !  they are a little heavier than most . 
i also got the non serrated thin blade . 
my wife is a little reluctant to wash the knives now because she doesnt want to lose a finger . 
its cheap and works good .  .  . just hope it last for yearsmmm a a a . 
the back is still on and no issues at all . 
i saw the documentary fat ,  sick ,  and nearly dead ,  and was inspired to try juicing . 
i love not having to fiddle with a carafe and the coffee stays fresh a long time . 
i love the glossy finish but it does scratch easily as i have multiple small scratches on it already . 
the thermometer is a basic old fashioned glass one with the red liquid line indicator . 
it would be nice it it had a temperature adjustment . 
i am so pleased and impressed with it ,  i am ordering another today . 
i can t say enough good things about this product . 
you will be amazed at how much easier it will make your life . 
it doesn t happen every time and isn t a deal breaker for me . 
i assume that s how they get such remarkable battery life . 
i feel even the bagged salads must now be washed also ,  especially after the spinich e . 
one wonders why phones don t ship with some sort of screen protection already installed on the screen . 
oh and when your friends and coworkers see you talking on it . 
browsing through amazon s selection i came upon this chicago cutlery beauty . 
that s one reason i didn t like the sensation . 
that method takes about a minute ,  plus there s steam all over the place . 
it s so easy that even a blind guy can do it . 
i pour it in a container and refrigerate it for later so it will solidify more . 
the first one was a gift ,  the second one was a must have buy . 
its a great device and can be used with any usb charger in your car . 
make it easier to replace some lunches with green smoothies . i ve been drinking breakfast smoothies for years . 
the bells and whistles are fun should you want to use them . 
it does make a rather loud humming noise  which i prefer  because it s nice to fall asleep to . 
its huge and the part that catches the clip is rubber . 
we actually purchased this for a printer stand as it matched our office furniture . 
its worth it . if the  oil  film effect affects you ,  well . 
due to hotspots you may have one spot you need to cook longer . 
i enjoy this one better than the george foreman grill . 
i have used it with other bread doughs to make little sandwich rounds ,  also . 
this pressure canner is of very high quality . 
there is some light leakage on the the upper  functionality  keys and it is distracting . 
i all ways use whetstones and steels on my knives to keep them sharp . 
it works just as well today as it did on the first . 
this is the most useful cookbook i have ever purchased . 
i just love seeing this sitting on top of my range when i walk into the kitchen . 
the large loop handle makes it easy to pass from one person to another . 
if you ve read about wusthof knives ,  or owned any ,  you know how excellent they are . 
i used this for over a year without issue before it was time to replace . 
i use the device with a motorola num_extend phone  cingular  . 
my wife and i got this pot rack and i really couldn t have been happier . 
i am not a sucker for fads ,  gimmicks or  miracle  devices as seen on tv . 
the wood handle feels nice and sturdy; definitely not flimsy . 
the handle is nice and heavy balancing the cutting action nicely . 
i bought two and put them to use right away . 
i can charge my ipod or kindle whenever i want even if i am out of the country . 
i bought this as a gag gift for my aging mother . 
touch sensitive keys located at the bottom of the screen are a mixed bag . 
the nokia num_extend is alot easier to use . 
i never have enough cables and the short length frequently require the use of a usb extension cable . 
looks rather attractive too ,  if i need to break it out for table service . 
bought this for a friend and have never gotten a complaint yet . 
it provides even heat all over the pan for a consistantly well cooked pizza . 
i bought this as well as a couple of the same thing in black for my captivate . 
fits the phone like a glove and seems like it would give pretty good protection against hitting the ground . 
i bought this for my mom and the texture is just awesome . 
i have been very pleased with this case so far . 
it saved me from buying a new phone !  . 
i also have some random disconnects with my blackberry . 
but since most phones are coming micro sim now it will not last . 
these are great for cleaning out a jura coffeemaker after running milk through it for a late . 
when your done wash out the brewing cup and you re finished . 
it is a num_num cup ,  which translates to num_num mugs in my house . 
email said it wouldn t get here until august ,  but got here a few weeks sooner . 
am sure that it will work just fine . 
it is esthetically attractive and the controls are easy to identify and use . 
i have just about all the different sizes . 
it unnecessarily continues try to charge the phone . 
actually i ve always wanted a food slicer but never had a good excuse to buy one . 
plus ,  i can use it anytime as it is no larger than my hoover vacum cleaner . 
i will also not have to worry able gaskets ever again !  american made too !  . 
i got one of these someplace else in queen size . 
there may be a secret to this too ,  but the instructions should have uncovered it ,  which they didn t . 
electrical tape works best to remove lint and lift the edges without glue transfer . 
they have convenient buttons built in to change the song ,  adjust volume ,  answer a call ,  etc . 
these stickers work like the review says they do . 
it s really helpful to have these belts available ,  especially at the same time you buy the product . 
i always keep one on hand as a backup since i use my pressure cookers often . 
producing the most delicious steak i have ever had . 
a very nice feature is the warmup cycle . 
i cooked a large pot roast in this pan the first night . 
the crust comes out brown and crispy ,  and the toppings perfectly browned and melted . 
the pry tools are good for the price and when used correctly do a fine job . 
i bought this bowl for melting chocolate on top of a saucepan . 
i wouldn t buy any oxo product or any other product from amazon . com if it had bad customer reviews . 
i got this knowing i would have to trim it to fit my ipod . 
i can charge dual items at one time . this to me was a great purchase . 
it was dulling the blades and ruining the knives . 
purchased this one from amazon for $ less and the quality was much better than my original . 
i m jealous with it !  thanks to snoozer full body pillow hypoallergenic synthetic fiber filler . 
it was ok for its time ,  but it finally bit the dust . 
this shows a temperature range and it s easy to read . 
it s expensive ,  but i really love this small appliance . 
i ve have about a year of use on it . it s light ,  sounds good ,  and the battery lasts a long time . 
it looks great and the soft touch paint makes it look better and easier to hold . 
it appears to be quality made and should hold up for many years . 
been buying these for years for our company phones . 
the dial still turns ,  but the little compartmentalized wheel inside does not turn . 
having said that ,  i ve purchased camera cases that are just painted on . 
i have to take the lid off to pour ,  but that s no biggie . 
i use this holster for running and it works pretty much as it should . 
some of it may have to do with my individual microwave . 
it mixes very well ,  especially when you add bulkier ingredients like sunflower seeds or dried fruit . 
the num_extend is a good product with a really solid form factor . 
if you are reasonably careful and don t overtighten it ,  i imagine it will last quite well without problems . 
if the product breaks i will update this as such events become present . 
the seam is almost invisible in the black color . 
if you are in a pinch and need a cable ,  or several ,  these will work . 
i did a restore to factory settings ,  and repeated this process ,  before i went online looking for a solution . 
finally ,  a quality french press that makes one full mug of coffee . 
this is just what my small kitchen needed . 
this is an indispensable tool to have in my day to day life . 
but ,  upon closer inspection and comparison with an unsharpened identical knife i realized it is mainly an optical illusion . 
so anyway ,  based on all the glowing reviews i did buy this corkscrew . 
battery pays enough to make calls and daily activities . 
box fans are great ,  place then in a window and they ll cool a room down in no time . 
the amazon price for this item is superb compared to other retailers . 
i agree that num_num glasses num_extend ounces of water   ,  is not that much . 
the finish is just awesome nothing seems to stick ,  it washes out easy and clean . 
it s only been in use for num_num month ,  but so far it does a fine job . 
use these on a daily basis for our home based cake business and they work like a charm . 
thanks amazon really enjoy shopping online with you all . 
i waited awhile until i could have the right set of circumstances to buy it . 
my family has had a set of farberware classic pots and pans for over num_num years . 
velcro closure is rugged and works perfectly on a consistent basis to keep your phone num_extend
although i am not a fancy cook ,  every kitchen needs one reliable knife and this fits the bill . 
tried a few other machines and ended up returning them or giving them away . 
the hard rubberized type case is much easier to hold than the plain galaxy case . 
be sure to match up the notches when sealing and let it cool down properly before opening . 
they are sturdy and strong but can be a little difficult in putting together . 
just remember if you want to stir fry ,  the secret is not overloading it . 
this is perfect to use while filling jars . 
you can use a dishwasher ,  but i hand wash mine . 
it feels a little stronger than the other case . 
the silicon case itself is already good protection ,  but the hard shell just tops it . 
i keep mine in it s box because my home has narrow kitchen cabinets . 
if you don t have the otterbox ,  you don t need this item . 
plus the handle makes it easy to store on higher shelves out of the way . 
for example ,  i use one for power tools ,  one for fiberglass materials ,  one for general tools . 
how do they sell something so cheap and yet ,  it works just fine ?  well ,  i m happy !  . 
my hubby and i both cooks and hopefully i will get to use it first . 
the more you use it ,  the easier it is to put it on right the first time . 
a kitchen requires good tools just as much as any other venture . 
i ve had mine for num_num years now and it works perfectly every time . 
do not hesitate to order it if you are thinking about it . 
at home ,  they are one of the first companies i turn to . 
ends are razor sharp and can be sharpened if dull . 
i usually get between num_num and num_num bar ,  consistantly get num_num to num_num bars with unit on . 
they are easy to mix in and the pour from . 
great design ,  integrated flashlight and laser pointer big pluses . 
but it does require an external heating device such as a stove . 
dual controls ,  a bit more extra heat on your feet ,  and a num_num hour auto shutoff timer are bonuses . 
it has developed a  patina  from burned on stuff but that is par for the course with any stone . 
i will repurchase this same bluetooth it is still the best it was just my error dropping it . 
the rack had to have some kind of gripping feet so it could not slide . 
we actually bought these from a popular department store ,  but much like everything else ,  found it cheaper on amazon . 
they are thinner than the ones i got years ago but they work beautifully . 
why potatoes ?  because their starch content makes them naturally sticky and therefore a challenge to chop evenly . 
this one is perfect for sauteing small items or for cooking num_num egg . 
holds a charge seemingly indefinitely ,  and did better than the advertised num_extend hours of charging . 
my big problem with it is that is does not hold a charge for a long time . 
if you dont want your phone to break ,  buy this case . 
with this case ,  not a scratch . but there are two bad things with this case and holster . 
this made it easier to get the bubbles out . 
haven t used it extensively ,  but it seems to be just fine . 
the extra grip on the handle makes it so easy to use . 
this charger is a great fit for my htc one with a slim case and i love it . 
i tried both ear pieces ,  and no help . 
num_extend lighter than iphonecustomizable :  you can do literally anything to this phone . 
the iphone num_extend has many functions that consumers will love to experience themselves . 
honestly for the price ,  i was expecting knock offs . 
it fits a little more snugly than the oem one it replaced ,  but that s not necessarily a problem . 
this is a cute case that i got for my htc inspire and i love it . 
after a lot of research and review reading i decided to purchase the lcd screen+digitizer from zeetron . 
our waffle maker wipes clean with a paper towel and nothing else . 
over the years i ve had several french presses . 
a quality product that is visually appealing and very sturdy . 
this one makes a great cup of coffee and is simple to use . 
this press works fine but you do have to press fairly hard to get a thin tortilla . 
needless to say ,  i tossed the two bialleti pans . 
sturdy enough for home use and the clear lid makes watching the eggs easy . 
it is very easy to assemble and use . great buy !  !  ! updatethousands of gallons of juice later .  .  . my omega still works great . 
i accidentally thought it would be hard plastic ,  but its heavy and ceramic . 
if so ,  have to use them singlely !  have not really tried them yet but hope to soon !  . 
i have num_num black and decker citrusmate plus juicers; one for each of my homes . 
i couldn t wait to do the tomato test ,  and it passed with flying sharp colors . enjoy !  . 
slice your finger down ,  and the volume falls . 
paired with theapple wireless keyboard  retail packaging my iphone looks like  mini me  next to my num_extend imac . 
i installed the dolphin hd browser for surfing the web . 
these rings glide smoothly across the curtain rod . 
then stir well ,  and microwave for another num_num seconds ,  and stir well one last time . 
it is very easy to use ,  store ,  and easy to clean . 
but do not work out with them ,  they will break from the sweat . 
alternatively ,  you can use amicro sim cutterto cut a regular sim down to size . 
it s rugged and your phone can take a beating with this case . 
but i have to say that it works like a charm ,  better than anything we have used . 
it would break in about num_num months or less . 
i haven t received any complaints about the audio quality from the person on the other line ,  either . 
i can see us having this cutting board for quite a few years . 
i use it with a charging station to carry for backup power if needed . 
i own them for my ipads ,  iphones ,  android phones ,  etc . 
prior to purchasing the num_num inch skillet i only had a num_num inch chicken fryer in cast iron . 
but lids from some of my other pans fit it ,  so no problem . 
many of the lids have cracked over time and render the glass bowl unusable for me . 
the acase superleggera pro for iphone num_num and num_extend is much better than i expected . 
i ve had this set for almost two years and i still love it . 
i received the micro usb converter in num_num days ,  much sooner than expected . 
i really like the quality of this pan .  . nice weight ,  handles are convenient . 
heck ,  this one might even work on those cheapo  never needs sharpening  knives . 
i needed something that would bring the natural cool air in and it does the trick . 
easily the most comfortable headphones i ve worn in decades . 
or using the carafe itself to pour water into the reservoir ,  which can gum things up over time ,  . 
this charger works great on a droid x . 
came back and bought num_num more for friends . 
i ll be using it all the time so it s right there for me to grab . 
i have had many various smartphones and this case fits like a glove . 
their stuff ispractically indestructible and their warranty is asgood as your mamma s word . 
it has never failed me ,  spilled a single pepper corn ,  or had any issues . would i recommend this ?  yes . 
please beware that you cannot download the nokia ovi suite because it currently supports only windows . 
if your expecting oem at this price good luck . 
i told her about my popper and for christmas this year ,  i got this one for her . 
also ,  there is never a time when this toaster is too hot to toast another batch of bread . 
if you need to work on a lot of phones or tablets this worked great . 
but when i would use a regular knife to divy out pieces ,  the bread would end up smooshed . 
it is not % transparent ,  and it has a foggy tinge to it . 
just poke it with a fork or butter knife . 
amazing on how effortless the process can be . 
this costs a little more than most but it is better quality by far . 
every access port ,  led light ,  and speaker hole is still accessible with this case . 
well balanced and a smart mix of knives ,  none too unwieldy or huge . 
i just purchased this timer a few days ago and i love it . 
everything on the phone can be replaced with another app of your choice . 
was working on my daughter s xbox num_extend an older model without the hdmi out . 
in less than a week ,  a new replacement one arrived with prepaid postage sticker to return the old . 
the num_num isn t amenable to glasses ,  but the other two are . 
not a thing needed adjusting on either of mine . 
you have to say its a womans thing for pink . 
a few swipes on a diamond steel ,  better than new every time . 
i used hot plate popper before ,  but this popper is better than previous one . it is very convenient and effective . 
go to your local super store or office supply store and buy these locking metal rings . 
i liked this popcorn maker so much i bought five more for my friends and family . 
by far it s the best cookware i ve ever used . 
great shelf allows us to stack them on the back of the dryer vs having them on top . 
it is bright ,  colorful ,  and the set seems to be made of a good quality material . 
the edges are rounded with no sharp corners and the brownies bake perfectly in it . 
seems the perfect combo of all ,  just put num_extend on it and it would be perfect . 
i just got my first chemex maker and had to get the filters . 
i am blown away at the increase in performance . 
i prefer it to larger tower fans or big oscillating fans . 
there wasn t anything wrong with this case ,  it was just a little too thin for me . 
this far exceeds my expectations heats up fast and is accurate . 
this will almost be a fine espresso type grind ,  regardless of coarse or fine . 
you could use sugar with some water to liquefy it ,  maple syrup ,  or honey ,  instead of the agave . 
the tapered shape and nobby rubber grip feels comfortable and secure in the hand . 
i registered for this set ,  figuring that nobody would actually purchase something this nice for us . 
i ll begin with the end :  the jambox is quite loud and features pretty decent quality sound . 
it works ,  though not quite as well as actually making poached eggs the old fashioned way . 
but then i had an idea and used it to fit all my eyeshadow too . 
same color as mine but the professional model . 
also melted butter ,  but unless you ve got time to waste ,  it s not too convenient . 
the bowl is very large and will accomodate a hefty amount of greens . 
an additional bonus is that it can be plugged into my num_extend car charger . 
after making my own yogurt with % milk ,  i put the yogurt into the cheese maker . 
i don t think you can go wrong with this one . 
much easier to use than the whole hassle of opening the phone back and swapping out batteries . 
it s a stone ,  not a gleaming automobile !   ie ,  get over it .  .  .   . some folks reported trouble with the stone arriving broken . 
if you just want some nice sharp ,  durable steak knives these are the ones you want . 
we got a replacement from target but that one died too within a couple of weeks again . 
i am extremely satisfied with this toaster oven . 
in searching for yet another case ,  i discovered this blackout case . 
i can hear other people without any issues . 
takes a long time to get the kernals hot to pop . 
i can not say enough good things about this phone cover . 
the extra handle makes for both easier and safer handling . 
i purchased the car dock and the desk dock with my num_extend
i had an old pepper grinder for years which did not work . 
the price is awesome and it is so multifunctional . 
also the cord to charge the num_extend has a double use then to charge my ipod touch . 
i found this wired num_extend plantronics num_extend windsmart boom headset and love it . 
i would say the only downside is the indicator light isn t very bright ,  and it doesn t really add much . 
doh !  i extracted the torn piece of cardboard from under with a knife blade . 
further ,  i keep my phone s ringer on  silent  so coworkers don t know when i receive a phone call . 
i use this coffee pot every day and every day i love it even more . 
instead of potates i use this to rice my turnips and they are a big hit with my family . 
i use this pie server for pies ,  cakes ,  and even to serve pizza s . 
this pan will last forever if you take care of it  no soap ,  keep dry  . 
tall sturdy drinking glasses that were exactly what my mother had bee looking for . nothing fancy but worth the price . 
it s durable and gives all the access you need . 
we make smoothies and jusice drings in this and chop herbs ,  garlic and make quick sauces . 
this is an older calphalon style ,  hence the price . 
these aux audio cables are the greatest retractable cables and by far the most inexpensive i have ever purchased . 
the price here on amazon is good and they re usually prime . 
i think its too big of a case for my likes ,  but she doesn t mind that . 
cause i did resell it to a relative who still uses it alot . 
the only issue is that some of the shortcuts don t work . 
cleanup is easier as the build up on the grill softens . 
lids hold tight and secure and are not warping or streching ,  heavy glass ,  just a great value . 
this is the first coffee grinder that i have ever purchased and i am extremely pleased . 
handy ,  useful and functional ! excellent choice for a case !  its hard and resistent for any fall . great for its value !  . 
similar to the otterbox but at a reasonable price ,  which makes it even better . 
this fiestaware jumbo cup is a welcome addition to any fiestaware fan s collection . 
and i wrote this review for that particular purpose . this is also perfect for jogging or doing the treadmill . 
i have another pillowcase that i bought before this and the difference between the num_num is night and day . 
what a great deal for all three !  i am so pleased with my purchase s . 
even after sitting for several months ,  it remains charged for the next trip . 
as far a juicers go ,  its quiet and does a super job at juice and pulp extraction . 
it also allowed me a bit of extra height that foil wouldn t give me . 
she is able to charge her phone by way of computer and outlet . 
can t wait to make even more items on it . 
these are very thick ,  heavy pieces with silicone lids . 
there is no broken buttons and all it actually takes is the turn of the dial . 
just beware ,  once you use this battery ,  you cant use other aftermarket cases ,  they are too thin . 
once it s attached you can put the pieces back together . 
having one that s too small is far ,  far worse than one that is slightly too big . 
i really enjoy using this item for both cooking and serving things with butter . 
this is perfect for steeping loose leaf tea . 
like how the bright colors make each one of them easy to find . 
people say i don t sound  tinney  and it s clear . 
i use it to remove veggies like string beans and brocholi to serving up pasta . 
i saw a new one of these go for $
the kickstand is a nice plus ,  but i have only watched one video ,  so it doesn t get much use . 
i plan to hone the knife before each use ,  and i do have a really good knife sharpener . 
it has been a very handy piece of equipment to have !  . 
for the price vs number of uses ,  i can t complain . 
fits num_extend num_extend num_extend num_extend num_extend num_extend and num_extend glass cover ,  num_extend dia . 
charger will only output num_extend amps total  not each port  and can only do so after being modified . 
there s an edge on the outside where the inner and outer walls were joined . 
i ve cut myself  badly  like three times while trying to clean it . 
it s much louder than my last system so i can use it with protective earplugs . 
i have actually received some positive feedback from those that have seen it on my phone . 
it looks like real leather ,  smells like real leather ,  and feels like real leather . 
prefer these to a sharp plastic stylus ,  they won t damage screen !  . 
i can t image turning this thing all the way up . 
if you are only going to grind spices ,  the smaller version might work . 
i m a pretty big coffee snob ,  but for the price ,  this is a great machine . 
drinker and it s so hard to find a good decaf . 
this little puppy works great !  i use this for num_extend online gaming . 
however i did cover it loosely with foil to cut down on the splatter . 
the rubber exterior bounces and absorbs the shock of each fall . 
handy to have around for smart phones too . 
just be sure to use the blue thing that comes with it before applying . 
i typically do this at night while traveling . 
five stars for excellent coffee and ease of use . 
have not yet come across anything that makes better coffee and would highly recommend this product . 
wish i d thought before renovation to see if new upper corner cabinet could have been a turntable but didn t . 
this applies to all cast iron that isn t overly pitted or has any holes . enjoy some amazing steaks on this . 
i love this pan and use it all the time . 
i plan to use it for a big batch of mashed potatoes over christmas . 
if there is a body in the way  or an aquarium ,  etc  then the signal drops off  attenuates  dramatically . 
talk about sore muscles the next day !  lol . 
if i continue i ll be a full oxo household . 
there is a little retaining tab to keep it from sliding off easily . 
been out for a long day and your phone s running low ?  this thing fits in your pocket . 
i read the reviews of the waring and saw how % of the people loved it . 
i use a bread machine to make the dough ,  then roll it out and bake on this pan . 
i bought it to charge my cell phone in my truck ,  and it definitely does that . 
i bought a victorinox chefs knife and decided it made sense to protect the blade in my knife drawer . 
i ll be brewing some every morning to start my day off right . 
it does quite nicely with frozen meat or veggie patties and chicken breasts . 
this unit is stable ,  quiet ,  easy to use ,  and does a great job . 
they have a nice smooth surface to put my printed labels on . 
definately a heavy duty last a lifetime shiny feels and handles good tamper . 
once that was cleaned it worked like new . highly recommended !  . 
i love my lg tones !  !  !  the sound quality is just as good as my skullcandy titaniums . 
i can t wait to use it on many other things . 
fingerprints ,  glares ,  all of that is gone !  works great . 
i picked the elago num_extend slim fit case because quite simply it was the best case for those factors . 
you have to be patient until you learn how to position the num_extend
this works just fine to recharge my captivate . 
the only drawback is that my friends keep trying to steal them . 
bought this because my dog chewed up the first one . 
i had never used a cookie press before and this was incredibly easy . 
since it was very cheap i decided to try anyways and i don t know why some people complained . 
just screw the wands together ,  attach it to the base ,  then charge it up . 
its num_num months later and she still loves them and thanks me often for them . 
stir just till moistened  batter should be lumpy  . when mixing this batter ,  my wife followed the above instructions . 
i needed some storage space due to my laundry room not having any shelves . 
but i love the way these pans cook ,  and they really are worth the extra money . 
be sure to spray some on your fingers as well . 
i ordered this for the white one ,  and will give away the other three . 
i do use white pepper often ,  but only as powder . 
i use it as a secondary cutting board . 
better to keep the phone in a pocket while talking . 
i am not a verified buyer on amazon for this product . 
bread toasts evenly and it s easy to set how dark you want it . 
i have had it for over a year ,  and it still looks like new . 
it provides good protection ,  good fit and it s thin . 
while the documentation is not too good ,  it s pretty easy to get going with the unit . 
they are made well and will cut through most anything . 
after shopping around a lot ,  this was the best deal i found . 
they should have made the rubber part extend a little more towards the handle . 
this charger is great ,  it works well and charges pretty quickly . 
this little thing saved me so much time and effort . 
anyone ,  i got a second one for my sister during xmas . 
the the past ,  i bought lots of covers for my infuse phone . 
as my grandkids say ,    the kitchenaid made it and it s delicious  . 
it works good for an inside grill pan though . 
i have had almost every case out there for iphone num_extend
but over time i think it will loosen . 
but all in all this is a great case with superior service at a super low price . 
i have gone through quite a few humidifiers . 
it does work fantastically with softer frostings and whipped cream . 
you and your guests will love this delicious gravy ,  and the separator which made it so easy to make . 
this has that corn perfectly steamed in num_num minutes . 
my wife has a red torch so this color works perfect for her . 
to adjust the thickness of slices you simply turn a knob . 
i have no complaints on the lock so we must move on to the button itself . 
one thing for certain is the three layers with thermal core . 
that makes it much easier to turn off from a full on position and vice versa . 
it s nice they can be purchased separately depending on your needs but costs start to add up quickly . 
important update :  i see now that amazon is listing this at $
why ?  when you cut dough ,  you want to cut it ,  not tear it . 
the only time i worried about the performance from the phone is the occasion xbox live game . 
i have two phones in the house and both use this otterbox . 
the mic is pretty good but the other party can tell you are on a speaker phone . 
i use the original charger and cable that came with the palm pre to power my touchstone . 
it doesn t rattle or clang like metal window fans . 
they all came out of the press with no problem of them tearing or getting deformed . 
everything that your phone does can be viewed in num_extend resolution on your tv . 
but i am really happy with the product !  definitely a good buy !  . 
while milk can be used ,  cream results in a much richer ,  thicker ,  tastier ice cream . 
the boxwave case i bought for my note ii  bodysuit  has disappeared from amazon . 
it s attractive ,  sturdy ,  and i especially love the long spout . 
this stay hot enough to do it right . 
this smaller size is perfect for two people and a couple in for coffee . 
as for comments that it is hard to clean . 
the handle is really long which is nice for keeping away from the heat . 
of course it would be criminal of me not to mention the overall quality of this rolling pin . 
they are very secure sitting on the counter even with ingredients num_extend
i sprinkle on a little cornmeal before putting on the crust and it slides right off . 
after we figured out the lid and lid placement it is wonderful . 
we ve had this pot for almost six months now and we re happy with it . 
and there is no touch screen to enlarge areas with fancy finger work a la iphone . 
i m looking forward to purchasing other attachments for it in the future . 
and this one doesn t jump around on my countertop like my older one did a bit . 
we tried half a dozen ways to unseal them to no avail and sadly had to throw them away . 
that said ,  it is the best spatula i own . 
all that being said ,  i could not be happier with this beauty of a shun . 
they are very sturdy however and they clean out very easily . 
the old one still worked ,  but looked nasty . 
in all ,  i recommend the set ,  especially for the price . 
if you want to steam your clothes with no effort buy this steamer . 
the pan has to snap properly in the clips on either side . 
sooooo much better than my old plastic one . 
i strongly recommend this one  for the price  . 
it was easy to install ,  the liquid solution makes it so much easier than traditional covers . 
this is a great kitchen utensil in every respect except one . 
i does not go on easily and you do have to work at it a little . 
i really enjoy using this for my phone . 
the water filter makes it taste so much smoother . 
just pull one tab ,  place ,  and pull the other tab . 
merry xmas and happy new year to all . 
poor results with these . first ,  i paired the headset with my motorola num_extend cell phone . 
or sealing that quickly wears out with use . 
i have an older hunter air purifer that i bought at home depot . 
bento every day ! who knows .  .  .  . maybe i ll save money and lose a few pounds !  . 
no worries ,  once i arrived home i simply used to unit to charge the phone and presto ,  no worries . 
i like to gind my own beans and have never used a perc coffee pot in the past . 
the new blackberry os allows me to  touch  just about anything on the screen and trigger . 
i use a little mazzola extra virgin olive oil spray . 
i ve just been leaving the infuser out and using it as a coffee thermos . 
it has almost exactly the same construction as the belkin but costs % less . 
wish they came in a smaller version too  :   . 
these are on the larger side but they work well in my kitchen . 
it was key to pumpkin carving ,  and essential to all sorts of chopping . 
i had heard about their quality and decided to `splurge  on the num_extend skillet . 
i destroyed the screen  digitizer  and got a replacement screen . 
it was worth every penny and is so easy to use . 
i didn t want a spot heater ,  or a heater that needs to be monitored . 
think that i need a physics lesson to really understand how and why this works so well . 
this one is acceptable for the phone and listening to audio . 
just rinse them off in the sink or wipe them off with a cloth . 
this case comes with a screen protector ,  a silicon layer ,  and a polycarbonate layer . 
handy for draining things . more recently ,  i have been experimenting with eating a raw food diet . 
i have had other steamers but they never lasted . 
it can be used for rice ,  mixing ,  and of course ,  cooking . 
i do not have that problem with this french press ,  and no glass beaker to break either . 
after opening the lid ,  out came this good smelling circular cone . 
but a nerd who has a fully charged phone . 
i may even get another one in the future . 
these bags are sufficient thickness and quality ,  they work quite well . 
if you re considering switching from ceramic plates ,  do it now . 
it has taken some abuse and i wear it most of the day . 
all i can say is this knife is sharp right out of the box . 
this is not the same cable used for charging or data transfer between tablet and a pc . 
i would recommend it to anyone who has a tablet or smartphone . 
i would be dealing with way more dust flying around if i were changing a vacuum bag . 
i have used the samsung num_extend bluetooth headset for about num_num months . 
i just realized that i ve had this brush ,  using it daily ,  a little over num_num years . 
if you re looking for a waffle iron ,  look no further . 
wait for the rubber to soften and your ear to adapt a bit and things will get better . 
i live alone and find myself filling it up multiple times a day . 
i finally looked for one at amazon ,  this was just what i wanted . 
for my veggie stuff ,  hardly any residue is left behind on the grill . 
that wastes a lot of coffee and scatters more grinds . 
we ll see if it really lasts for the life of my phone . 
mophie sells some nice case that work very well . 
the wood handle stays cool and makes cooking easier because i do not have to wear oven mittens . 
i like this feature as it makes it easier to measure out the correct amount of grounds . 
it is easy to use and is worth it s price tag . 
the ear hanger holds it over your ear and the little rubber scoop guides the sound into the canal . 
this is my  go to  pan whenever i m cooking for our crew; can t imagine cooking without it . 
victorinox gives a guide for sharpening on a steel and it works pretty well . 
the oem shop sends out quickly and i could not be happier with the price . 
you can position the air flow where you get the best results . 
can charge my samsung galaxy num_extend num_num times . 
i really .  .  . really liked this case .  .  . until the plastic tabs on the side broke . 
recently i purchased the rh label of this from smartbargains and so far this one is also a winner . 
i grew up using the stand mixer but got the professional after using it heavily in pastry school . 
if that does happen ,  i ll update this review . 
the lights are built into the base and handset and you can not see them when they aren t blinking . 
i also bought nordic ware brownie pan same good quality . 
i like the stainless better than the black . 
this one of the greatest products from plantronics !  !  i have tried others that have failed signifantly in the past . 
keeps things from sticking ,  even using it in a small baking sheet when making cookies and the like . 
cheese often gets stuck in these parts and turns hard in there . 
problem is ,  the case has a tendency to break . 
it s sturdy and good quality and has some weight to it . 
a lot of people from our office were complaining about  splattering  from the chemex when brewing coffee . 
i can even let the kids do it with no fear of them cutting themselves . 
i do hang it in my closet right now . 
i put it in my brand new nexus num_extend
but ,  nexus one gets extremely hot after using gps for an hour or so . 
this is actually an amazing case for my phone . 
the only thing is that one side of the case keeps popping off . 
worth the price paid for and goes on fairly easy . 
it keeps the coffee hot until you use up the last cup and unplug it . 
amazon page predicted delivery within two weeks ,  but my shipment arrived in less than a week . 
however ,  sincecast iron gets very hot in the oven , one cannot hold it very long . 
this mixer is strong ,  sturdy and has a relatively small footprint in our average sized kitchen . 
the dark path that had been trampled into the carpet in the high use areas had almost disappeared . 
handle is sturdy and stays cool when the pot is hot . 
i have had has a few people ask me if i purchased the new iphone . 
but anyone with a kitchen scale can adjust to that . 
when it is charging the phone ,  the car radio gets lots of static . 
i thought this would be a waste of money . 
i love the fact that i can answer calls by simply saying  answer  ,  no buttons to press or find . 
i have well water which is not the best ,  these filters do the job . 
it s weighty ,  denoting quality materials ,  not a lot  but some ,  for sure  of plastic . 
now this is what i been searching for . 
good old fashioned heavy duty blender with no frills . 
this is a must have product for anyone who ever travels in to weak or out of signal areas !  . 
watch out for sellers that ask num_extend of bucks for the fan . 
no water rings ,  keeps drink cold for hours and holds alot .  .  .  . love these . 
what people need to learn is a little common  maybe uncommon  sense and not put flammable items on it . 
it has never failed and makes great coffee . 
i decided to purchase the lettuce keeper and the lettuce knife because of the reputation for quality from oxo . 
it sliced right through the small shells and its small profile just searched into all the narrow spaces . 
i m still using it to this day and the battery will last longer . 
but for a cheap aftermarket bluetooth solution this is a great buy . 
bought this a year ago and installed it myself . 
i don t have to get down on my hands and knees and crawl into the cupboard to find things . 
it has held up well and is easy to clean and fill . 
however ,  i wanted to try these after reading many good reviews . 
when my machine originally arrived they had sent the wrong color . 
this thing makes a great tasting rotisserie chicken . 
it cannot be purchased from wilton  which is a real crying shame  . 
they have all turned out perfect !  i have also grilled hamburgers ,  steak and turkey bacon ,  too . 
doesn t seem flimsy from what i can see . 
this is perfect for under my bathroom sink . 
my usage has always been determined on my battery life . 
i use this machine even for recipes that call for hand stirring or hand whisking . 
there really is no problem with the case itself but the phone . 
these are easy to apply ,  are staying in place and were cost effective . 
very interesting to see what items are energy hogs and which aren t . 
i ve used mine for over a year and like it a lot . 
henckels are the best brand of steel knives you can buy . 
however ,  this headset does come with multiple different ear pieces to accomadate your ear . 
very portable and recommended for people looking for usb adapter . 
really solid piece ,  unlike those plastic ones you get from a set . 
i didn t look at the ozs close enough . 
i no longer risk burning myself leaning in to get a firm grasp on the pan . 
this ice cream maker is awesome ,  i love it . 
the first one ,  which we bought several years ago ,  finally quit working . 
makes going out much easier and she has to carry way less stuff now . 
unfortunately ,  when the headset arrived ,  i noticed that there was evidence of earwax under the earbud . 
the screen protectors did exactly what you would think they should do ,  they protect your screen . 
the phone really does look like there s nothing covering it . 
throw it all in my food processor and pulse until it comes together in a ball . 
i let the cookware cool off itself while i eat after cooking with it . 
its easy to clean and it does not rust . 
but that s fine for me as the my bath gets fairly high with this . 
while the captivate seems very wide ,  it is also very slim and thus surprisingly light . 
the hd station was shipped quickly and received on schedule . 
also ,  the manual that came with it and the website shows two pivot points on this dock . 
the only flaw is that the lids are difficult to put on at first . 
i ve had the blendtec num_extend for num_num years ,  and i use it all the time for smoothies . 
one can wish ,  and separate devices seems the practical way to go . 
choose this one and you won t be disappointed . 
rinse top half of unit with a quick wipe of its bottom of where grounds gather . 
i was disappointed because i expected what was in the picture and description . 
the charger itself feels high quality ,  so it should last for quite some time . 
but it is well designed and i hate my other one so i m keeping it . 
i do a lot of knife work with vegetables ,  meat etc . 
came in quick and they looked just like the picture . 
the mill as pictured shows a white accent button on the handle . 
cleans up easily in the dishwasher and i hang it with my cast iron . 
one in your back pocket ,  briefcase ,  purse ,  whatever ,  one in the phone ,  and one in the charger . 
wonderful for slicing cabbage ,  and so fast and easy !  !  . 
because of the size and convenience of this dish rack i am purchasing another one for my parents . 
i was feeling guilty for throwing away paper filters each day . 
i like the black in that it is more discreet and disappears on the woodwork outlet . 
i am far from being a pro at pasta ,  but i am learning . 
amazon does a great job shipping them also !  . 
the implication is that by putting the arrow onto the number ,  that s how long the timer runs :  not quite . 
i purchased this item for my husband s iphone num_extend
i thought the description on the amazon site was a bit misleading . 
youtube and other flash movie outlets are another story . 
considering the price of this otter box compared to the retail pricing this was a great deal . 
this one caught my eye immediately mostly because of its stylish design . 
just make sure you have the usb end fully inserted into the lighter adapter . good product . 
you may have read ,  as i did ,  that a few people received theirs with a cracked top . 
because it s made of glass ,  and it will break . i recommend this baster to others . 
 g for me ,  the heater only misses a score of num_num due to the annoying beep sound . 
the packaging is great ,  very easy to open and get to the product . 
it made it s first pot of coffee this morning and it tastes great . 
just don t plan on using it in very noisy situations . 
no problem with clean up ,  looks beautiful in the kitchen . 
not only is it sleek ,  but it also feels amazing in your hand and provides extra protection . 
combine this with the calphalon pots and you ve to a kitchen to die for . 
i will do that later but all seems well so far . 
it is obvious by the swirling marks that it was worked by something . 
some holes might be a little at the microphone but no big deal . 
the defender was too much case for me and i did not like the screen protector . 
it s not the biggest ,  but its size lends itself well to our gas burners . 
items which we used to throw out  due to becoming stale  we no longer have to . 
cooking is more enjoyable when even the simplest kitchen implements are of the highest quality . 
sleek and convenient to store and i just love it . 
i like that the parts are all dishwasher safe . 
i considered purchasing a used one ,  in the shape that i prefer ,  but . 
i like it because the handle doesn t slip out of my hand . 
i don t have a dishwasher or sensitive teeth so can t speak to those complaints . 
everything comes in a small box with a cloth ,  a card ,  the full body protector and a spray . 
the cord is conveniently long ,  but that only makes dealing with it more important . 
however ,  we hardly ever use this feature as it doesn t seem to do anything worthwhile . 
it s fairly thin ,  fits perfectly on the phone . 
been about a month now with heavy daily use and not one issue . 
mine is clearly marked as made in china . 
so far ,  no problems and it was well worth the num_num bucks . 
while laying it down ,  i use a gift card to push out any bubbles . 
this affordable case on the other hand ,  is not rubbish and fits the phone like a glove . 
this holds the same amount as the num_extend
i had been looking for an num_num quart electric pressure cooker . 
put this under the otterbox to keep out anything that the case let through and so far cannot complain . 
heavyweight plastic and last for quite a while . 
plan on getting extra for when you lose them . 
i was wrong .  .  . i thought it was going to be a typical  as seen on tv  piece of junk . 
this has a long cord ,  no recharging ,  and superior suction . 
it s relatively easy to clean and we and so far it s extremely good quality . 
in fact ,  buy five or six of them and stash them everywhere . 
just like all the other reviews point out ,  this knife is sharp and it holds and edge . 
my daughter used it and she had more issues with it until it dried and then she was happy . 
i like the triple weight gauge and the sturdiness of this one . 
i would recommend it to anyone who enjoys popovers . 
so if you need to measure anything lesser than that ,  you need a different cup . 
i could not do without it and highly recommend it . 
a very good price for an official charger . 
i purchased the stand in graphite and i m glad i did as it matches the look in my kitchen . 
i like how easy this case is to get on and off . 
it also looks very attractive on the nightstand . 
i purchased this mount for my samsung galaxy num_extend and htc amaze cell phones . 
hopefully it will in fact charge an iphone num_extend
i was having so much trouble finding a replacement  that didn t cost a fortune  until finally discovering this one . 
on my asus infinity tablet ,  i hear the words slightly before i see the actor s mouth move . 
right front and right back or left front and left back . 
overall it seems a good product ,  at least for the hopefully occasional use i will need it for . 
it s worth it for the memories it filled my head with ,  regardless of how the coffee is . 
i have a number of pieces from fiesta ,  and look so pretty on my new table . 
otherwise ,  a very snug fit and add s some bulk to the phone . 
i love this case ,  it s great case . very good quality ,  fits perfectly . 
i called amazon and rather than returning and getting a replacement ,  they knocked $ off . 
made my first successful batch of rice ever . 
it s clear ,  so you can actually see the phone itself underneath . 
i first bought this immersion blender num_num years ago after spending hours researching them . 
i was very frustrated but i recieved an email from the company apologizing for the faulty devices . 
just dump grounds in trash or compost and rinse out . 
it scoops ice cream to the perfect tight dense scoop easier than any other ice cream scoop . 
but for all other purposes it is a great board . 
after seeing my girlfriend get an iphone num_num i became infatuated . 
no more fighting the beast ,  it peels as easily as an apple . 
i just recently purchased this knife and i was blown away . 
it has a cut out for the front camera and fits perfectly on the screen . 
i store some later ,  and i wash this on the bottom rack for the next day . 
i blend infrequently ,  but i want good results . 
ordered another one ,  and it will not stay charged . 
this is my fourth otterbox for my iphones . 
really you can t go wrong buying this microplane . 
i bought these batteries here from amazon ,  and i love them . 
radiant heaters warm your body directly ,  but ,  keep in mind ,  this one is very bright . 
but other than that ,  they ve held up well for the num_num years or so that i ve used them . 
none i ve tried really work ,  so no diff here . 
i d also be careful with the plastic knob on top of the plunger . 
i love my classy ,  durable coffee mug !  it never leaks and i like it because it s not cheap looking . 
i love fiesta dishes ,  and this plate is a great size . 
i have to use homemade alcohol stove to make my coffee . 
my wife bought an otterbox case for her iphone num_num two years ago ,  and she loved it . 
mixed the dough ,  kneaded the dough ,  rolled out the dough and cut the dough . 
to all who say the screw heads stick out ,  you put it together wrong !  read the instructions . 
ateco is a trusted brand for me and very sharp cutters makes clean cut outs . 
i own quite a few bluetooth headsets :  motorola ,  jabra ,  plantronics ,  and this one . 
this makes my second boos cutting board and i am so pleased with the wonderful quality . 
i use this for my nexus s ,  but it is compatible with anything that uses a micro usb port . 
the case doesn t add much bulk to the device . 
i ve had this product for over num_num months now and have never been let down . 
cathy replaced our old worn chinese stoneware dishes with two of these sets so we d have enough for company . 
it does the job we paid for it to do . 
sometimes ,  it s the simplest design that works the best . 
i am happy i bought this item because our closets do not have any organizers or shelves in them . 
i don t have to worry about extra cable from regular headphones . 
waiting for my next coupon so i can get a num_extend one . 
this is an excellent screen protector that went on easily with no bubbles . 
bakers who want less browning typically stack a pair of rimmed half sheet pans to create some insulation . 
i had a very good experience with this cable . 
i wanted the option to customize ,  and make the phone truly mine . 
this item is nice to use with kitchenid . 
but it is light weight and buffs my wood floors nicely . 
i did num_num quarts of green beans and num_num quarts of corn and num_num pints corn . 
they stay in place very well ,  are as indestructible as the manufacturer claims . 
it is very useful and saves time too . 
a regular size onion is also too large so it has to be cut in half also . 
pick these up for yourself and for those you love . no i don t own oxo stock . 
thekitchenaid num_extend hand blender ,  whiteis quickly becoming my favorite kitchen gadget . 
it really made a difference and i sleep much better at night now . 
the only organic twine that is easy on the hands is all cotton ,  which this is . 
the front is open ,  so you can still use your phone with no problem . 
the head of the penguin comes off then you pour from the strained top . 
i think it will last a long time ,  but an extra belt comes with the unit . 
i saw this and decided to give it a try . 
but if you do ,  it s worth how much easier it makes your life . 
clean up is a little more challenging ,  but not as bad as one might think . 
but ,  totally worth it if you have a mosquito problem . 
just heat as much water as you need . 
little pricy but you have to pay to play rough . 
enough said ,  very sturdy and pleasing to look at ,  if that matters . 
owned a plantronics blue tooth device previously and thought i would upgrade . 
previously ,  i was unaware that it did anything other than chop up vegetables but i was wrong . 
i don t use the bread kneaders but i use the other three every week . 
great for crabs or a boil and for canning ,  which why i got it . 
i am very happy with the weight of this felt . 
i love my stylus there great there a little small then i expected . 
just thought that was due to using too cheap a plastic on the top part that lifts up . 
for mixing and scraping the spoonula can t be beat !  . 
it is fairly fast and the coffee is nice and hot . 
clean lines that will go with contemporary or transitional decor . 
i purchased this item in early december of num_extend
i love everything i have purchased from rocco bormioli they are always high quality and lovely pieces . 
my children just counted .  .  . i have made over num_num crepes in my life . 
i have the hardest time finding bluetooth earbuds that work on my tiny ear canal . 
just note that this can only go on a wall ,  it won t work mounted under . 
i didn t like the hand soap dispenser i have . 
it is difficult to find very large mugs as nice as these !  !  . 
i have a plantronics bluetooth that i used for a long time . 
i have been thru many iphone cases trying to find the best one . 
my num_num year old son loves this headset . 
i am very pleased with the quality and price . 
it does it well and looks just like the picture . 
i ve had this coffee maker for almost two years now . 
i just keep them charged all the time . 
it was exactly what i needed to charge my phone n my car . 
i bought this as a gift for a friend who saw my pampered chef pitcher and wanted one . 
there s not much to say beyond the picture . 
but you don t want to be stuck with something that may fall apart or that won t charge your device . 
really works well for slicing bread from my bread maker . 
i just don t like bland ,  bitter or too strong tasting coffee . 
the popper pops popcorn pretty darn fast ,  way faster than butter can melt . 
that is a good thing . the kitchenaid mixer is a workhorse . 
using this peeler is very easy and the handle fits in my hand comfortably . 
the cups are hooked together but can easily be removed to use as individual cups . 
baking soda is the only safe cleaner you can use because it is edible and non toxic . 
they baked my cake well and it came out better than expected love them . 
it quiets right down then . spring release quickly and safely releases the phone . 
it has surprising suction ,  it s light and easy to handle ,  and it gets the edges pretty well . 
i don t really need this feature ,  but it is a nice way to keep them together . 
plus i get to see the beautiful sami coat in my closet all the time . 
yes it really protect my phone good . yes i would tell my friends . 
i did a little research and concluded on this product . 
i bought it so long ago and kept meaning to leave a review . 
it s not ideal but it s an improvement nevertheless . of course ,  not all is perfect . 
these kleenex pocket packs are perfect for keeping in your car ,  your office desk ,  your purse ,  etc . 
i sometimes get forgetful and put num_num measures in which shuts the machine down . 
they are excellent on top of a ceramic cooktop and don t leave marks like the anodized pans did . 
im no pro but i bought this to help learn . 
this guide is a bit on the wide side .  .  . but with a little practice it works just fine . 
the charger works fine ,  i have had no problems since i purchased it . 
good for those of us whose eyesight isn t a hundred percent . 
in sum ,  these two things  temperature and loose circular bottom part  are not enough to not like this product . 
it s durable and easy to keep a grip on ,  and it looks great !  . 
the handle has a good grip to it and doesn t flex or bend ,  which makes it easy to hold . 
much better than your standard plastic insulated aux cables . 
that said ,  i occasionally find myself repositioning them a little forward or backward to relieve my ears . 
rebuilt the entrance to a customer s shower and used these for the curtain . 
they kept my screen nice and scratch free . 
this canner is identical to the one i grew up watching my mother use . 
also ,  i think ,  better ease of gripping . i checked the products available at local stores before i bought this online . 
still ,  if a diesel truck is nearby ,  folks will hear it . 
but the writing is raised ,  so i don t expect it to be a problem . 
one of two  different  microwave omelet makers sent to my daughter . 
any wire has to be picked up or blocked somehow . 
if you check at the store they are very expensive and you get only one . 
but ,  all ports ,  buttons ,  and camera lens are accessed easily and it slides fine . 
i love espresso drinks from starbucks and other coffee places . 
the charging case is a great !  i only have to charge it about once a week . 
now i use the new one for garlic and the old blade for pulverizing oats into flour . 
you just pull out the filter ,  and rinse the chemex out . note ,  you want to grind you coffee course . 
couldn t get through a full day on a charge . 
i expect to buy more of these rather than the belkins . 
this is a perfect bottle opener and matches all my other oxo utensils . 
works great !  highly recommend this iron ,  no need to hesitate about your purchase !  . 
i ve had these for probably num_num  maybe more years  ,  very little sign of wear ,  still works perfectly . 
i cook a lot ,  and they have been used extensively . 
i believe they are itouch num_extend with num_num gb drives . 
in any event i did not have any difficulty with the jabra speaker . 
battery lasted longer than my original when i first bought it . 
frustrated i went on a new search and found these stainless towel holders on amazon . 
dry it on your stove over medium heat . 
if it happens again i ll let you know !  . 
yogurt gets more sour the longer it incubates . 
they tend to last a few weeks before they start showing signs of wear . 
turn off droid and restart it  it thinks i swapped batteries ,  something iphones can not do  . 
as far as electronics go ,  they are always at or near the top ! great products ,  great support and great parts !  . 
the feel of the unit is fairly solid ,  it doesn t feel like cheap plastic . 
the top cover is a big improvement than the previous case . 
 i bought the whisk attachement  a definite must tool in the kitchen . 
they re thick and sturdy ,  but not too heavy . 
i am very pleased that it ended up working . 
it actually came in about two weeks which was awesome . 
it s a great value and ,  functionally ,  it does the trick . 
i like the different sizes and the colors are pretty in my utensil crock on the counter . 
felt strong and not feeble even for its size . 
i have on the other hand have had glass shatter  yes ,  even pyrex  with hot liquids . 
i love the pasta roller ,  it makes it so easy and fun . 
it is such a good product that i bought one for my daughter . 
don t use apples that have been sitting weeks or the soft core just busts in half . 
points on the lid encourage condensation to drip back into the pan ,  instead of over the edge . 
the boards are a bit smaller that our old ones but they are thicker ,  so they shouldn t bulge longer . 
it comes with two spare cutting wires and replacements are available on amazon . 
once placed on the counter ,  it doesn t slide . 
these things are awesome !  !  i already had some orange silicone things that worked ,  but were messy . 
i have bought a few chargers for my phone that haven t work so i am happy with this one . 
then you can go at the highest volume on the speaker unit without the sound cracking as much . 
they are about the size of a large cereal bowl . 
we use it to make eggs ,  saute ,  make grilled cheese sandwiches can fit two sandwiches at a time  . 
it does clean beautifully and i ve never had a problem with hard to clean coffee stains . 
this product is great and comes at a low price too . 
my son doesn t touch carrots ,  but he doesn t even know they re in his smoothie . 
what noise you hear is rushing air  can t get around that and be effective  . 
i ve had one of these for num_num months now and i really like it . 
mine has been on for over a year and it still looks great . 
i am not disappointed in the quality of the product . 
it is such a no brainer for people like me who are not seasoned cooks . 
% of that time will it be able to display what song is playing in the car as well . 
i love the idea that i no longer need to have a professional cleaner company come to my house . 
as another reviewer mentioned ,  once that cover loosens a bit ,  it just holds water . 
it looks fragile but actually the glass is quite thick . 
i don t know why stores don t sell these . 
the device is lightweight ,  attractive and with a squaretrade warranty can be insured for up to num_num yrs . 
it fits my mixer very well and definitely keeps the dust out of my mixing bowl . 
it keeps charging the palm for the whole day and still have plenty of charges left . 
i give it four stars because of this weakness . 
how they called it large i ll never know as it is much smaller than the oxo . 
works fine ,  just keep an eye on it . 
it s easy to use ,  makes great ice cream ,  is fairly quiet . 
while the flip takes a little practice ,  it is easy to catch on to . 
loving this color ! arrived intact ,  packaged carefully in homer laughlin boxes ,  with cardboard separators . 
and good to have something for the road . 
it s pyrex ,  so i know it will last for years . 
it is still quick and easy to manipulate . 
i do enjoy getting num_num packs though for that very reason . 
i was introduced to them during food service work ,  where they were used until they were completely falling apart . 
good glass and the lids fit snuggly ,  i threw out all my plastic . 
it is far superior to the two plastic mashers i bought while trying to replace the old wire style . 
one of my best kitchen purchases !  the two smallest sizes are perfect for packing in lunch boxes too . 
the pan was great and the service was outstanding . 
i decided against ordering another oxo mandoline because that design makes long items like zucchini get stuck . 
it is the can opener that i use every day . 
i have a gas stove with a long center flame specifically for a griddle ,  and this is great . 
thorough pleased with easy in dumping the containment . 
i bought these eargels for my bluetooth ,  which happens to be a samsung num_extend and it fit it perfectly . 
it has settings for many different types of bread ,  darkness and loaf size . 
they last and cook evenly ,  two more pluses for cookware in my book . 
now i can simply place it on and go . 
it is not an android but it is more than an android . 
ha ,  i did this num_num times . fried potatoes tonight didn t begin to stick !  i love the skillet . 
maybe not quite as much ,  but it s fine . 
it s large enough to make food for num_num people . 
this is not a sandwich plate ,  just a bread and butter plate ,  or saucer or plate for side items . 
it is small enough to reside in a corner on my countertop ,  and so easy to set . 
it slipped right out and was perfectly browned all the way around . 
i knew i wanted corelle because it s so durable ,  and i have no interest in overpriced china . 
there has been no big problem getting the core out of the slicer like some have commented on . 
my hubby uses it and i do the rest . 
it remains sharp as a razor and is the most used knife in our knife block . 
my slicing skills have been kicked up a notch . 
generally i always think products such as these are way over priced . 
but it s way more than a fondue pot . 
use blue tooth ear piece or headset for your phone conversation as the phone will be in the cradle . 
i bought this refurbished unit for her from amazon in num_extend
after num_num weeks of use ,  we are very happy . 
what a convenience if you don t want to heat up the stove . 
i have a similar external battery pack from the same brand and use mine daily . 
this is true even for veggies ,  which tend to cook pretty quickly on an outdoor grill . 
perfect for protecting my daughters phone !  easy to put on and doesn t distort the screen . 
easy to use and the sound is acceptable . 
unfortunately ,  the update software did not function so the issue persists . 
i got the equivalent of a paper cut while wrestling one of them off . 
in all honesty , we probably wouldn t have bought this pan exceptfor the price . 
in other words they must not be extended . 
i also love how lightweight they are and how easily the fit in my dishwasher . 
i have num_num indoor cat s and num_num indoor dogs ,  one of them a all times shedding ger . 
its staineless steel and big enough for two utensils to rest there . 
this was part of a gift to my daughter and husband . 
this coffee maker make about two mugs ,  the amount i usually have for breakfast . 
simple and does what it shows it will do . 
in a phone with a bottom connector it bends to the right ,  over my headphone jack . 
it is a very bright yellow at the top that gradually becomes more golden towards the bottom . 
it also charges my blue tooth ear phones properly . 
there is a slight color change on the buttons letting you know that a second tap is needed . 
the white case also often gets mistaken for the white iphone ,  which is a plus !  . 
this item is very practice ,  very well made and extremely cute . 
use it all the time and enjoy it . 
i would not recommend more than a few small bottles or just soap and a sponge . 
does a very good job ,  i still have and use it on an old model ipod . 
these measuring cups arrived right when i wanted to try a recipe for double chocolate chip cookies . 
i am extremely thrilled with how great this makes my phone look . 
now why did mine come with a made in china sticker on it ?  . 
it turns itself off after the phone is unplugged a short while . 
it can be used with a swivel ,  ratcheted belt clip  which doubles as a  tripod  stand  . 
i would order it again as a gift . 
the size is perfect for cooking many things and i love the removable silicone handle cover . 
i ve made white bread ,  wheat bread ,  raisin bread and my house specialty ,  wheat with oatmeal and walnuts . 
cleanup is simple ,  and the grip is more than adequate for a larger sized hand . 
works perfectly ,  easy to clean ,  and replacement parts are widely available if needed . 
i just thought feldman really over stated the machine . 
overall ,  this machine deserves each of its five stars . 
there aren t any limits of what you can do with this wonderful machine . 
i usually make mango ice cream in it . 
someone else asked about storing their broach collection pinned to it ,  yes you could do that . 
only complaint is that it would charge my fone faster . 
this wok is amazing !  it heats up fast ,  has good capacity ,  sturdy build ,  nice lid ,  and is very adjustable . 
my other objection is that the lid doesn t fit very tight and tends to rattle around . 
i love everything about them except the stickers on each and ever plate and inside the bowl to boot . 
it was fast and a little messy at the beginning . 
it s very fast ,  easy to clean up ,  and the meats ,  seafood ,  and poultry taste great . 
i never go anywhere without this  !  i leave it in my truck . very smart purchase on my part ! thank you . 
the coffee brews hot and stays hot without turning bitter . 
keeps ice chilled for hours and its got a classic look and feel . 
it is easy to use ,  small and light weight . 
the pan works great and was shipped just in time for thanksgiving baking . 
i purchased this after doing alot of research to replace my rusty old swing away opener . 
i m so glad that this headset came with an usb adapter ,  wall charger and a car adapter . 
this is typical belkin ,  which means high quality and high price . 
no problem putting it on . there s definitely an art to applying guards perfectly . 
as the reviews have stated ,  this is a high quality product . 
as potholders ,  they re probably fine ,  if you re dexterous . 
it includes a new brewing section as well . 
i have used my first one for seven years with success . 
it is rubbery and slides off easily ,  so not a big deal !  love it !  . 
i am not sure i would have purchased it if i had known these things in advance . 
there is also a dial ,  to dial up the tmes ,  which works fast enough for longer times . 
what i love about it is that it gets very hot and it does not automatically shut itself off . 
it is close to ,  but even better than ,  an old favorite that finally gave out . 
its pretty hard to really burn something onto this pot . 
the four led lights that display capacity are not very accurate . 
the entire set is oven safe and i find that also an excellent feature . 
and the other is i have a hard time getting it loud enough . 
very secure and not too big of a pain to get out . 
i make one pot of coffee a day ,  six days a week . 
like the title says ,  worked and fit great . 
it handles really large cans with ease ,  and the over sized soft knob is a plus . 
we use it on camping trips more than we use it in the kitchen . 
i like this product ,  but it s not perfect . 
i have the highest end ge electric stove but i m not even sure it makes a difference . 
it is not super strong but it does the intended job . 
as such ,  it works exactly the way you would expect a motorola battery to work ,  for much less money . 
it s a simple protector ,  nothing special but the number per the price was exceptional at the time . 
if this was only used for jerky making ,  it would be worth it !  so simple to use . 
other than that ,  it protects my iphone ,  which is exactly what i needed . 
we do stir fry a lot and this is perfect for leftovers too . 
the filters are difficult to find ,  but i am glad that amazon has them . 
i use it daily as i have num_num inside cats . 
while traveling ,  this little gadget comes in real handy . 
i haven t tried grinding spices or nuts with this grinder . 
great for storing anything from pasta to sauerkraut in the frig no more rusty canning caps . 
this was just what i was looking for . 
i think sound quality is better than apple earbuds . 
nothing but good cooking with these so far . 
i personally love these tongs for the following num_extend
it fits nicely in my jean pockets or phone pouch in my purse . 
for the price i have no complaints and would purchase another one . 
this juicer is a great product contrary to what the first few reviewers had to say . 
i have been organizing all my kitchen cabinets . 
amazon offers a great priced compared to other retailers on this  unless you get a % coupon at kohls  . 
i love the stand ! i clean the frother by spinning it under streaming water and then spin it dry . 
i use it with another type i bough t at the same time . 
they wash off or peel off easily ,  even if burnt to a black crisp . 
heats pretty quickly ,  no smell or taste and i am not an easy seek on anything plastic . 
the imp num_extend charged my devices for a full week . 
i can even lay the bottles on their side in the wine fridge when using these stoppers . 
gravy making was so much easier this year !  . 
something on the inside would rattle in a cheap and nasty way . 
always wanted one ,  and now i have it . 
it makes cooking and baking so much easier . 
this is a good buy if it is what you are wanting . 
 hint :  speck  i can take it out easily after some effort to plug into my dock for charging . 
it makes finley chopped foods easy to  scoop  up . 
so such an inexpensive unit ,  really worth the money . 
this is really the perfect alternative to a shop . 
we will try the old bodum mesh in its place and see if that s any improvement . 
feel like i ve bought every version of screen cover . 
and it s small enough to be left on our counter . 
most reviews complain that it is too tinny . 
otherwise ,  just about perfect !  love them ,  bet so will you !  . 
most dinnerware from mexico and china are the ones that have the highest amounts of lead . 
the first few times i set my phone in ,  nothing happened . 
the color is great and as usual ,  an otter box doesn t disappoint when it comes to protecting your phone . 
its so comfortable ,  i forget i have it on . 
i think they look nice enough to use as dinner dishes ,  plus they are great for storing leftovers . 
measure .  .  . the reason why i bought and still have my plastic set . 
it is fine for the price ,  nicer than i expected . 
it appears that the bottom and the top is not all one piece . 
the wine saver comes with two so ordering more is a good idea . 
the data transfer and charging are taking place just like on the original . 
my only issue is that the battery engages immediately after charging it while attached to the phone . 
all in all an ok product for the price . 
i got this screen protector for $ and it does exactly what it s supposed to . 
this scoop scoops ice cream easier than any scoop i ve ever used . 
makes popcorn fast ,  only a couple of kernels unpopped . 
at this price ,  there is no excuse not to have one . 
i would put down a num_extend but refuse to round up . 
these utensils fulfill my range of needs while adhering to budget constraints . 
i love corelle and when i had the opportunity to own this for the holidays ,  i was quite excited . 
without this device ,  my smartphone would have been dead by num_extend
most of my file transfers are via hardwire ,  so i searched for and quickly found this item . 
you get use to the  method to its madness   be sure to read the directions ,  otherwise you ll be lost  . 
i bough this for my hubby ,  he does construction and it really works for him . 
got one of these along with a few spare batteries for my droid num_extend
if you are familiar with using and caring for cast iron ,  there really are no surprises . 
although we have guests over regularly ,  i find the capacity of the pot to be very good . 
but i shouldn t have to go through such a hassle over such a simple step . 
i think it s a great deal for the price . 
over the last num_num years we have owned several types of rug cleaners . 
i mistakenly thought that this fan was num_num inches wide ,  but the face is num_num inches wide . 
;  i ll post pictures on here if i can so i can show you how it turns out . 
we did appreciate the extra loop handle for added security when moving the pan . 
i love cedar and the smell that this shoe rack allows for my closet . 
this unit ,  this venta ,  will do the job those num_num did ,  without any filters whatsoever . 
i have also given at least a dozen as gifts ,  and gotten nice feedback from recipients . 
i was very happy to see it was not some type of counterfeit screen delivered to me . 
it means his needs of charger his phone . 
but how is the call quality ?  well ,  i got to say that it s decent . 
and they re slim so they re comfortable to hold . 
ft home in laminate floors ,  with the master bedroom keeping the carpet . 
just make sure to spray them with cooking spray before using . 
it adds sufficient color without an overbearing appearance . 
make sure to put lids on top rack of the dishwasher . 
when i place it on the dash of my car it doesn t slide off it stays in place . 
this is everything i wanted and all i will ever need in a mixer . 
i like the way it doesn t stick out a lot . 
i got these and i am not displeased . 
this battery is for my super old moto num_extend phone that i am using as secondary phone . 
it connected with my phone s bluetooth quickly and easily and it works great . 
i m really picky about design and am often let down when i actually get a product in the house . 
i love kitchen gadgets and have been burnt many times while trying out new products on the market . 
it s lightweight and pretty cute . i like that i can listen to music through the headset . 
even their reviews said it wasn t very durable so we took it back . 
what i mean by that is .  .  . i am a bit put off by the plastic handle . 
there s not much you can say about this product . 
there is no way i would ever take it off . 
if you lower the tea strength setting it usually won t . 
received this product and have been very happy with it . 
the body is protected by an outer rubber casing . 
thank heavens for a company that realizes noise counts for something . oh ,  the clear plastic parts are bpa free . 
i don t have strong hands ,  though ,  so this might not be a problem for others . 
it s fragile ,  shiny glass inside ,  like your your grandad s thermos bottle . 
i replaced one that quit working ,  i did think brushed metal would have a dull finish . 
this machine just goes to the ideal temperature and stays there . 
it has really made things so much easier for me . 
we have a bunch of these and they get used all of the time . 
i use frozen fruit that i put in the food processor so i didn t need the cover on tight . 
if you want perfect coffee and are a total coffee snob ,  look elsewhere . 
having a large single base kitchen sink i wanted my clean dishes to not touch the dirty water . 
provides uniform heat distribution ,  and i find the overall performance excellent . 
the railing around the sides keeps everything on the table ,  and the finish matches the interior of my motorhome . 
all and all ,  it is a good product . 
the lids fit tight without being too hard to open . 
yet it charges the ipod without any problems . 
this pad is awesome !  it sticks to the dash of the car and it stays there . 
highly recommended ,  especially at the current amazon price . 
these cases are cute and well worth the price . 
i don t put it in the dishwasher ,  however ,  as it easy enough to do by hand . 
this is a beautifully designed pitcher and the colors and color blend is wonderful . 
however ,  the headset that comes with the unit is bad . 
i love the way these things keep my cords organized and tight . 
and if i force it in ,  it will be angled downward . 
i also bought the ice cream attachment and it is very simple to use . 
they love the stylus for when they are playing on their tablets . 
i always keep it in my bag just in case . 
these knives have durable blades and the handles are strong and well weighted making cutting even easier . 
i don t know the difference between them ,  if any . 
all plastic cutting boards need to be replaced every few years so this one is no exception . 
i did not find this to be the case . 
it is so easy to haul around and do small quick jobs . 
we use these in our camper and love them . 
they seem fine ,  and i ve had the set for years . 
this will minimize problems ,  but not necessarily prevent all of them in my view . 
if you are num_num cm off from filling up the tall bottle ,  the relative error will be minor . 
we have had this oven for about one year and we are very satisfied with it s performance . 
i am really grateful to the creators of this simple but so brilliant organizing tool . 
i saw a salad spinner just like this at my son s house for years and always wanted one . 
i purchased as a gift for my daughter because she didn t have one . 
just to clarify ,  this is perfect if you need the glass and the black frame around it  the digitizer  . 
if you just want a one serving ,  easy coffee maker ,  this is good . 
the case actually looks like a cassette tape .  .  .  .  . and the purple color is very nice . 
now ,  that may be solely user error on my part ,  but it s still a problem for me . 
battery life is excellent . only complaint :  maximum volume is a smidge low . 
when the coffee is brewed ,  i put the coffee in a thermal coffee carafe . 
it is a bit of a chore to clean ,  but not all that big a problem . 
i ve been happy with it and think the other reviews largely do it justice . 
this one is made well and i love it . 
i am really impressed with how well this product worked . 
i am happy with it so far ,  very easy to use and clean . 
the gold bars on the card should face down towards the gold bars on the phone . 
the droid already has a real glass screen . 
i bought this charger for my blackberry phone . it s just what i needed and i use it continuously . 
the touch to change volume was also a welcome feature . 
the weight is great and it is comfortable to hold . 
it cycled on and off overnight  normal operation as it was set to auto  . 
loud and clear ,  and very easy to connect to my phone . 
the screen is also fully functional ,  which is a huge plus . 
don t spend more than you should ,  buy armorsuit is skinomi or iq shield . 
the set was shipped nested together with cardboard in between each bowl . 
num_extend should be adequate to charge your battery and run the gps navigation at the same time . 
i ve been looking at these mats for quite a while wondering if they really worked . 
it s sturdy stainless steel and sharp enough to cut through my pizzas easily . 
i will be purchasing more cases from this seller and am pleased with my purchase . 
weight is behind the ear and it doesn t feel like it will fall off when moving around . 
it keeps the dust off of my cuisinart goodies . 
it comes with the car charger as well . 
i got this for my sister and it came in great condition with everything that was needed . 
cant go wrong with this though the bb bold num_num often comes with it already . 
i was particularly pleased to discover that operamini installed and performed flawlessly . 
i also like how easy it works with all of my devices . 
i ordered this case and it came early !  it was cheap ,  and works amazingly . 
we have both this one and the larger vicks vaporizer at our house . 
i just wish it had a themostat control . 
this case is awesome but has one minor flaw . 
i was looking for a grill pan and had looked at several . 
i no longer miss my htc evo num_extend  :   . 
many functions can be found on the headphone ,  which is really convenient . 
i never used that timer in all those years and don t think i ll miss it . 
this zester is easy to use and comes in handy . 
my new wallet is so much nicer . i m very happy with my purchase !  . 
most of the other reviews are reasonably accurate . 
i did fairly well on my second try ,  with no air bubbles . 
turned off my epic num_extend touch ,  plugged in the jig :   binary download mode completed  . 
can t find a better price even at the big box stores . 
i still havent been able to figure out how to use most of the features . 
i find the job of emptying the bagless dirt rather nasty . 
there is nothing there though to tell you how to clean . great product !  . 
not as good as the braun but useful . 
i am so glad we did ! first of all it s very straightforward and easy to use . 
overall ,  i am very pleased with this purchase !  !  !  i will only update if this changes . 
i was fed up with the plastic turners melting ,  so i bought a quality product . 
these are virtually the only juicer type that can realistically juice the leafy greens properly . 
still waiting on the update to froyo num_extend but i suppose i ll just have to wait that one out . 
overall i think its a great case and it really extends the usage of theiphone  s battery life . 
must be meticulous about cleaning screen and follow directions for applying . 
but ,  of course ,  we had battery life issues ,  so we decided to buy this pack ,  and . 
their thickness is quite generous ,  making them less likely to react to overly aggressive cutting . 
this one was highly recommended on many websites for its great temperature control . 
it has dropped a few times and no dents noted . 
so i decided to give amazon a try for this price and i was not at all disappointed . 
it was mentioned in another review that you don t want to use regular sized chips with the small scoop . 
so ,  i was a little confused when it arrived and attaches to a wall . 
i was able to have one charging ,  one in my phone and a backup  one came with the phone  . 
plastic measuring cups are no longer an option for me after transitioning to stainless steel ones . 
it is a good holder and pretty sturdy too . 
did not need to speak loud to have voice sound clear in a call . 
that s a problem when buying things from ijobs . 
one of the simplest but most effective popcorn popper out there . 
love it !  so much cheaper than buying it at a retail store or from kitchenaid . 
i ve learned that android is an incredibly flexible operating system that is easy to learn . 
it is thick enough that it doesn t bend when trying to use it . 
it looks great ,  and there is no annoying glare . 
i have been enjoying my purchase for several months now . 
i ve so far used it as a suction mount from the windshield ,  and the vent mount . 
all it takes is one swipe to remove the peeling . 
they help to keep the bottoms of cookies from getting too done . 
it s like having a stereo system in one little device . 
power on and power off button easy access on facing panel of num_extend
this will help you make uniform cuts so everything looks nice as well as it tasting great . 
also ,  i couldn t get the ear piece to pair with two devices . 
just make sure your ashes are cold ! you can t go wrong for num_extend here on amazon . 
what can i say ?  it s a crust shield . 
i like how they stack inside each other for easy storage also . 
this will allow you to have raisins intermix into the dough . 
i really want to try some of the extra gadgets that it comes with too . 
it passed the ice water test ,  the boiling test and the price test with flying colors . 
in general i think these types of mats are better hand washed . 
it is very quiet ,  unobtrusive and takes up very little of their precious little space . 
it fits perfectly on your ipod num_extend gen . 
the drawback is that not as much food can be dehydrated on each tray . 
it s nothing astoundingly great ,  the quality could be better but i m satisfied . 
it makes the phone look sleek ,  and the color is better than pictured online . 
so ,  be aware of that when you are measuring to see if it fits . 
i like to use holsters and carry my phone on my belt . 
they work pretty good ,  like the way they save the screen from getting scratches on it . 
she uses it on the treadmill and elliptical . 
thou the large on is really medium then small then just round one . 
the marinator works well and accelerates the process of tenderizing and flavoring whatever you put into it . 
i have used this for almost a year for making cake pops . 
a very tiny portion on the tip rolled when the knife fell in the sink . 
i may not be best for older people because it does have a few quirks . 
you can peel num_num or num_num cloves in about num_num seconds  i m not exagerating  . 
it filters all off tastes from my city water . 
its big enough and adjustable for any phone . 
and as for pressure cooking .  .  . i deem it to be a well worthwhile new dimension added to my cooking repertoire . 
i have wanted a stand mixer for the longest time . 
maxx ,  but free shipping at amazon saves a drive . 
blade is not knife sharp but it cuts clean . 
but this ond had thd best ratings from the customers so i bought it . 
this spoon fits in with the rest of the tools i picked up . 
too hard to set up ,  adjust ,  clean ,  etc . 
came with a pair of heavy duty heat proof gloves which makes removing the meat easy and safe . 
i never tried the stock antenna ,  but i will at some point ,  just to see what the difference is . 
it doesn t react with food or liquids ,  it s durable ,  and it looks nice . 
i am tired of using the ones that come with chineese food . 
it will be happily replaced . i hope this has been helpful to num_extend
genius !  of course ,  the shaped cassaroles have the same high quality of all of the le creuset pieces . 
so far my new oster toaster oven has lived up to everything i expected . 
maybe not entirely necessary ,  but it did work well when i made num_extend
i would definitely recommend it and would buy again if needed . 
also the geometry of the case does make it little hard to reach the edges of screen . 
i use them for toast and small dips . 
the blue indicator lights will blink while charging and finally go solid once it s ready . 
these bowls are heavy duty and should last a lifetime and then some . 
i do a lot of canning and these tools are invaluable to me . 
best case available for the mts !  very durable and looks good too . 
very nice little tool to have ,  so happy i spent a little money on it . 
looked like good qaulity ,  but never used them . 
i gave this as a gift and my friend loved it . 
do yourself a favor and save on shipping by ordering one of every size right now . 
i got the matte black finish ,  which looks good and is easy to clean . 
i received this with time to spare from the estimated dates and it is perfect . 
as for as my collection of edc ,  hunting and tactical this stone can get these knives dangerously sharp . 
the machine basically tells you what you need to do . 
great size for an individual and cooking that corn bread !  . 
and who do you think is going to have to buy it ?  ?  ?  . 
it has worked beautifully on all of them . 
it s is a must have for anyone who bakes . 
they have such a small footprint in the cupboard . 
i m sure some of it has to do with the increased horsepower on the droid x . 
its stainless steel polished body makes cleanup easy . 
also good to replenish or add on to what you have . 
the cover was not that large that it couldn t be dealt with . 
i bought this in lieu of the lapdock since i don t need another laptop . 
if i m in the kitchen  farthest pt from router  my signal is one bar . 
as long as you stay within range ,  you shouldn t have any issues keeping a good signal . 
i also noticed that while charging my iphone it charges quick !  overall num_num stars . 
it is a very quick job to cut an apple that has been cored . 
i bought multiple sets and gave them away to others in our group who are using the phone . 
i used to burn my hands often with my tea kettle . 
best little mechanical device there is ,  bar none . 
we have overcome this by heating the pot first ,  dropping a piece of fleece over it right after brewing . 
it s simple to use and fairly easy to clean and it makes great cappuccinos and lattes . 
you should still use a case for your phone ,  but this helps a lot . 
however ,  my husband is a power user unlike me so his needs were different . 
i run it on high and after a while the noise just blends in the background . 
so far i have also even dropped one from counter height without any cracking or breaking too . 
you will definitely need two hands when you re moving around hot food on this baby . 
this is just one of those things every kitchen should have . 
he tends to not drop these as much . 
 :  it s very classic and comes with straws that so far have lasted us a few months . 
i mean ,  if i drop one of these babies ,  leaking is going to be the least of my worries . 
i have a tiny ear and i just put the smaller piece on and it fit like a glove . 
you ve seen those old kitchenaid mixers that your grandmother had still churning away after nearly num_num years . 
i still use it and love speck cases . 
they told me that my mechine was a num_num modle and the warrienty had expired . 
i have used this for a year to roast coffee . 
people need to just learn how to put it on correctly . 
i saw other percolators reviewed where customers complained of the thin metal used . 
i like the wide mouth jars for the simple reason that the opening is bigger . 
but that is good so that it can dip down into the pot with the water . 
i have tried this on a iphone and it works great . 
much better quality than typical disposable chopsticks that you get with take out . 
when i want to dip food out of grease or hot water this is the perfect skimmer for me . 
i bought these to go with a soda syphon that i bought for a gift . 
but honestly i am very skeptical at this point . 
so far i m a fan and don t have any issues . 
heavens ,  no !  please ,  please explore recipes from other sources ! yes ,  this thing is heavy . 
works great !  all it does is just protect the screen ,  but it works great !  . 
i ve been using this to max candy canes so i can make peppermint desserts and it s quite sturdy . 
you can also toast one item immediately after another without losing the quality from one to another . 
as long as it lasts for a couple of years ,  i consider it money well spent . 
these screen protectors fit my palm pre well and have prevented many scratches . 
i really liked the two tanks and the fact you can turn off the scrubbers . 
after researching ,  i decided to stay in the henckels line . 
the slimtalk is a marvelous new technology for mobile phone users . 
i can usually get num_num charges on my phone before having to recharge the charger . 
this is great for the car and use it daily . 
it is high quality glass ,  free of bubbles and defects . 
i just received my repair kit and i am very please with it . 
my wife has had this case on her iphone for months . 
i found a page where there are steps to install software that performs an upgrade for the the phone . 
i highly recommend this product ,  and being it is small ,  it fits anywhere you d like to place it . 
many people seem apprehensive to purchase white dinnerware for fear of staining . 
it fits in my car cup holder too !  . 
this bowl is identical to the original one . 
you can get the basics but its really just a visual for the class !  . 
my son needed a case that would work with his speaker dock ,  and this one does the job . 
i like that it doesn t interfere when i text . 
it really does make your tea brew faster ,  if you re the impatient type . 
i won t go back to plain tap water ever again !  num_num filters seems to last about num_num months . 
it does the job if your just looking to protect your phone in your purse or backpack . 
if you plan on cooking rice this often invest in this rice cooker . 
rather ,  send it through the press and let the garlic do the num_extend
my husband got a fancy grill from lowe s . 
no dead animals in my kitchen so nothing to carve with the other blade . i like the knife . 
i am pleased with the pan and will continue to use it to add variety to our eating experience . 
i m glad i bought these ,  they work great !  and with a low price ,  this is a win win purchase . 
the last screen shield i had was too big and kept cinching up on the edges . 
my last num_num battery times were num_num hours ,  num_num hours ,  num_num hours ,  and num_num hours . 
the only headsets that seem to work great are the types with a long boom mic . 
i bought an otterbox first but then ended up returning it . 
the base is strong ,  the highs and lows both wonderful . 
international roaming on any phone is very expensive . 
holds about num_extend cups and the long arm extends into the sink . 
this product is an example of how that is done . 
 they make all my electronics choices for me !   they said plantronics . 
occasionally i buy another pad and trade that out . 
bought with single switch blender of same brand . 
i d like to have seen this option in a different pen model . my overall rating is num_extend stars . 
now i can use num_num for dry and one for wet  i . e . 
you can talk for a really long time . 
these handles do not bend when scooping ,  whether it be flour or brown sugar . 
if you have the screen cleaned well ,  these will lay flat and you can hardly notice their there . 
works very well for grinding eggshells and other stuff . 
i love pure pop corn with nothing on it . 
an aerosol spray can of olive oil cooking spray works great ,  but i worry about the additives . 
xxxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xx xx xx . 
well ,  it s not flimsy at all ,  in fact it s sturdier than the old basket ,  just has a transparent quality . 
highly recommend if you re tired of being ghetto and having your stuff sitting on the ground . 
i bought it for a galaxy player ,  i know it s for a galaxy s num_extend phone . 
i ve been getting great results and have not had any issues with over heating . 
i bought these bottles to use as a space saver in the refrigerator in our motor home . 
the product was exactly what i ordered ,  i would recommend this item . 
i love my cork pops corkscrew ,  so when i needed replacement cartridges i looked for the best price . 
i dont really see a reason to draw so much attention to the headphone cord . 
i don t know what the recommended max temp . 
overeall really great item that isn t expensive at all . 
we use it for short grain ,  long grain ,  jasmine ,  basmati ,  and brown rice . 
this case is as minimalist as you can probably get . 
i put my teakettle on the very top shelf and have my aprons hanging on the top hook . 
the only thing is is that you have to be very careful with them as they are razor sharp . 
being stainless steel this means proper care of the finish . 
it is exactly what i need ,  and it works perfectly . this charger is a godsend . 
it pairs perfectly with all my cell phones  tilt and se num_extend and the response is great . 
i decided to get this several months ago even though some of the reviews were not real good . 
its works really fine ,  one time ,  good conditions ,  i recommend it . 
i usually carry my bt in my pocket when not in use ,  so this case frees up my pockets . 
i have used these on our tablets and phones . 
this case is exactly what i needed to protect the iphone while exercising at the gym . 
i recently attended a cooking event where electricity was not available . 
and the machine is quiet and fits right on my counter . 
if you drop it on a hard surface ,  you re going to break it most likely . 
i ve done beef ,  chicken ,  and pork on the grill pan and everything came out great . 
but they are great for email ,  which is % of what i do on my phone . 
why other ones don t have this simple design is strange . 
within maybe a minute ,  i couldn t hold it ,  and it was at num_num degrees ,  and climbing . 
i ve had several chargers and this is easily the most powerful one i ve owned . 
it looks dirty and really worn out on the edges . 
though this works great ,  i believe its a bit too expensive for being a simple timer . 
inspect the screen closely by looking at it on an angle to see any white dust particles . 
california  our butter stayed fresh and easily spreadable . 
works well for my iphone and is so much more economically priced than the ones at my cell carrier . 
i am very pleased with the cable i purchased . 
works very well ,  seems to be built well and a good price ,  much better than the cell phone stores . 
i particularly like to use mine in the car because the handle is helpful when i m driving . 
great slow cooker for one or two people . 
this fits the extended battery pack made by htc very nicely . 
this one for the price is excellent . finally got it right . 
chocolate chip cookies are in the oven ,  next i ll make white bread ,  and finally meatloaf for dinner . 
my grandma and momma both made us popcorn as kids with a whirley pop . 
i d put each rack on the counter separately for items heavier than a baking sheet full of cookies . 
he obviously has a defective unit because the motor on ours has held up fine for many years now . 
amazon has the best price on these but does not carry the gallon refill . 
they work great ,  just take a tad bit of time to get to you . 
just be aware of the wattage required for what you re trying to run . 
if you want quality there is a steal model . 
the gps is also pretty nice even though i have a dedicated system . 
our cats were curious about it initially but they no longer pay any attention to it either . 
based on my first one which i have the product is great . 
if you re in a car it may not shake out ,  but a great product and well worth the money . 
smaller heads would probably find it even more comfortable than my gargantuan melon . 
first i fried some pork chops on it and later that day we made a pineapple cake . 
it picks up anything and everything in its path . 
so ,  i found this case  in my favorite color  and i bought it . 
it was worth it !  i am not disappointed . 
one christmas ,  i received a salt and peppermill set . 
btw ,  i haven t had any issues what so ever . 
after moving to dc and living in a high rise i bought this . 
num_num inch is still big heavy  for three of us . 
if you are in kohl s and see the food network garbage just turn the other way . 
i m rubbish at cooking rice on the stove . 
this is my second investment in the extended battery . 
the bright color is fun and makes it easy to find . 
it does make a great cup of coffee and that s the bottom line for us . 
i bought this for the num_extend food prep cuisinart and it works great . 
shipping was on time and packaged securely and in original box . 
i just worked the boom switch back and forth feverishly until it started to work again . 
it s not even as long as my arm . 
the earbuds are very well made and fit well . 
i try to avoid dairy because it upsets my stomach . 
the saute pan is just the right size for most dishes i cook . 
i love stainless steel and so this funnel fits perfectly in my kitchen . 
pretty neat trick for my car ,  but may stick out too much for others . 
the oxo is more sturdy than most others . 
i prefer to steam my vegetables to preserve the nutritive value of them . 
this whisk is great to mix things quickly by hand . 
guys come on don;t cause a cb over a $ screen . 
take the black plastic ring off the lid . 
this set is just perfect for the kitchen . 
great lows and highs cool stereo sound and balance !  . 
it s kinda girly because their is reflective coloring surface inside . 
hard ,  easy to use and give all smart phone facilities . 
i use them ,  wash and dry them and keep them sharp . 
after searing some tuna ,  the oil was very difficult to clean off because you can t use an sos pad . 
it cam with num_num screen protectors and num_num screen cleaning cloths . 
this is the first product i ve had that has lasted . 
place the lid on the cup before brewing ,  place it in the unit ,  and hit the on button . 
i also have the big kitchenaid burr grinder ,  but reach for this one every time . 
my other coffee pot started leaking and because i am addicted to coffee .  .  .  . i needed one pronto . 
i wanted a grill with removable plates for easy cleaning . 
we have had this for a few weeks now and everyone likes the pattern ,  feel and finish . 
i ve dropped my phone twice since getting it and it s definitely taken the banging up and not my phone . 
my wife and i love making fresh pasta with this . 
the price was right so i bought two sets . 
it was available ,  then not ,  and i don t know who is at fault there  likely vzw  . 
i got it with a num_num for num_num deal thankfully . 
meat and poultry comes out perfectly every time . 
it seems a bed on the floor is too inviting for little kids . 
i like the fact that you can put any cup underneath . 
i have numerous amount of usb thumb drives which all have the little loop on them . 
there s a scale in there ,  so you can see how much water is in it . 
this is better than any carafe or thermos i have ever owned . 
this item just arrived on wednesday ,  april num_extend num_extend
its great to always have paper towels available while not cluttering up the countertop !  !   :   . 
and ,  it s very well made so i think it will last for years . 
i plan on making it a yearly thing for my family . 
it took me num_num or num_num times before i finally got it right . 
i bought this loaf pan to replace my old one ,  which was also made by a leading manufacturer . 
my knives are as sharp as the day i bought them . 
others mention that the plastic container that collects the ground coffee has static . 
found a spare num_extend adapter and my calls are back loud and clear . 
not in a  why have it there  sense at all ,  but more that . 
put two of these in opposite windows of a tractor shed to exhaust gasoline fumes . 
holds my iphone num_num in a lifeproof nuud case solidly in place on my boat . 
so i decided to splurge a bit and get one that will last . 
this chops evenly and can hold a good amount of food . 
these are undoubtedly the best kitchen knives we have ever used . 
and still use it for house cleaning especially good in kitchen . cuts down on chemical use . 
since they are metal stainless  they cook on the sides making it easy to flip . 
and okay ,  i m not the handiest person in the world ,  but it was a cinch to put together . 
i didn t expect too much for an inexpensive canister vacuum . 
it keeps your iphone extremely thin ,  but it s certainly not made for protection . 
helps with grip ,  since phone seems a little slippery otherwise . 
i just love the design on this tin . 
do be aware ,  though ,  that this is not a small machine . 
i purchased this one because of the lid . 
nice sized pitcher makes enough for two latte s without spillover . 
furthermore ,  the walmart prepaid num_num comes in a sealed package ,  with the actual manual that s specific to the num_extend
try this product and you will not want any other storage bag . 
i am used to charging it each night . 
i haven t cut pizza with it yet  cause i need it to cut other kinds of products . 
easy portability ,  has nice rubber points on the bottom for grip . 
after breaking our second glass carafe in our bodum french press ,  we opted for this stainless steel version . 
i have no idea how a product could break like this . 
my friends and family all love the wonderful and tasty rice the machine produces . 
for serious pizza families this is a must !  !  . 
but when they don t roll well you know it . 
you can do this as many times as you want until you get it the way you want . 
you can have a custom fit ear mold made from impressions taken of your ear canal . 
good experience with company and item received as scheduled . 
and .  .  . i like the way it lights up blue around the plug . 
my wife rolled her eyes when this  and a num_num pound bag of popcorn  showed up at the door . 
this gradually gets faster and quieter as the brewing proceeds . 
i needed something to use for stereo while at the gym . 
with little kids around things often get dropped or played with and this is holding up nicely . 
some games  angry birds and fruit ninja and some other games  and some apps  flashlight and eggtimer for example  . 
it also protects a little from drops being rubberized . 
easy on the hands and then right in the dishwasher . 
there were no bubbles and no trapped dust particles . 
the closing mechanism works perfectly and conveniently simply squeezing it together until tight . 
it works great when i do have the time . 
mine has seen a lot of use and it looks perfect . 
i get so many compliments on this pot rack . 
feels sturdy and well constructed ,  but not too heavy . 
i like strong coffee so single serve coffee machine does not work for me . 
when merged with the price i ll call this a num_num star item . 
good little kit ,  saves you lots of money if you have the patients to do something like this . 
i thought long and hard before deciding on this roomba discovery , after all it s not inexpensive . 
i like these covers ,  but they are very very bulky . 
if you jog ,  bike ,  or hike you re going to love the convenience . 
nice and small so it will fit in a jacket pocket without any problem . 
the ladies leave my house with a tale of two steaks . 
sometimes they get a little nasty and need to be thrown in the washing machine . 
this will work with any phones or devices with a micro usb charging port . 
i ordered my case on a saturday and had it by friday which was really nice . 
but it s not enough to make me not use it . 
but it is great for lettuce for one or num_num for sure . 
this is the only charging brick you will need . 
i dedicated the charger for use with my galaxy num_extend over the stock charger supplied with the phone . 
the opening at the top is nice and big  and you can fill through the spout too  . 
a pleasant surprise for us was the color of this unit . 
i love that i can use these with peace of mind with my ceramic knives . 
protects from all the times he drops it . 
i love it !  its cheap but good quality . 
cooking with them has been a pleasure ,  but it is necessary to reduce the temperature levels on the range . 
i am looking forward to bake bread and bundt cakes with this mold . 
the key is to keep everything in constant low temperature . 
great product ,  great optics ,  decent smudge resistance and good price . 
i actually came here to buy a couple more . 
as the milk level rises lower the frothing cup continually to keep the tip just above the milk . 
solved it by mounting a num_extend num_extend to the studs and then mounted the rack . 
they came in a small clear zip bag ,  within a large shipping envelope . 
the unit is easy to use and the screen see large and easy to read . 
i buy my spices from the bulk bins at my supermarket . 
wish the larger iced tea versions of them that i d bought num_num years ago were still available ,  too . 
so if you are buying as a gift that is something to think about . 
you can fold them and put cut up food into pots without losing alot like solid boards . 
but i also have a htc evo shift so i was still able to put it to use . 
i love this charger ,  it just sits there all nice and neat until you need it . 
i just washed it all out ,  put it all together and threw some stuff in . 
we did not install the base and just laid it horizontally . 
you can have many blocks of ice in case of a larger party . 
the water will build steam up and not dry the eggs out . 
with the fagor ,  all you have to see or hear is a gentle constant flow of steam . 
i like black design better than silly white apple theme . 
i m not a coffee drinker but i purchased this for grinding herbs and even more importantly flax seed . 
i love it; !  i love it; just what i have been looking for !  would recommend to friends and family . 
it is dirt proof ,  shockproof ,  waterproof ,  and snow proof . 
i don t make my espresso any other way . 
with a num_extend power supply ,  i can go several days without having to recharge my devices . 
pros :  looks exactly how it should in the picture . 
the old one rattled and vibrated and burped . 
i have num_num different appliances of this brand and happy with each . 
and seeing inferior material i m not sure how long will it last . 
which is about half of what they boast . 
it took about one hour to assemble by myself . 
it is wonderful not to have to drag out the vacuum every day for small debris on my carpets . 
i have the new iphone num_extend and this works awesome . 
i never thought i could love a vacuum ,  but i love this machine . 
it charges any phone with the  blackberry  type charger hole . 
this is a very good electric coffee maker . 
i am impressed at how evenly cakes bake without developing a heavy crust . 
i didn t like the ones with copper bottoms  too much trouble to keep clean  ,  but these are great . 
if you can t do that ,  you probably don t want this can opener . 
this was a much better price than the otter box and does the same thing !  . 
i really like the color orange ,  so this really worked out great for me . 
i would have been happy if the unit had only one heat setting much less num_extend
now they are my laptop ear phones ,  which is fine . 
music from lg glitches so much that i can t enjoy my music anymore . 
the case is easy to put on and remove . 
now ,  on the negative side ,  the case dramatically increases the overall size and weight of the phone . 
so i really am not sure what the big deal is about the dial pad . 
i didn t want to spend num_num dollars on another flimsy apple headset that was doomed to fail . 
it has multiple positions ,  each ideally suited for a particular use . 
a thermal carafe is what were were looking for when we bought this for the office last summer . 
i will be purchasing the replacement holder and accessories asap . 
just opening it repeatedly can break it as mine did . 
i am a heavy email user on my smart phone . 
i have been looking for a strainer that is stainless steel for a long time . 
used them for replacing my droid led screen . 
all num_num appear to be in good shape and are not damaged upon arrival . 
i have done the minutes several different ways . 
it is the best juicer i ve ever had for juicing leafy greens . 
this will keep the logo from getting scratched up . 
you may disagree after reading about it on the plantronics site . 
however ,  the prongs do not fold down ,  nor is there a prong cover . 
my aunt baked the groom s cake for our wedding and needed a num_num inch pan . 
after seeing mine ,  my friend too is going to get his own . 
i m very excited to try and use it soon !  . 
i m sure i ll be able to find other uses for it too . 
this unit has worked really well thus far . 
it s larger than i expected and that mirror shine finish is gorgeous . 
one has lasted me half a year so they re decent . 
it has a dandy hepa filter ,  which is a major plus in our house full of asthmatics . 
i have had no problems with it and it works great . 
but i did read the reviews prior to purchasing so i knew to be gentle with it . 
this battery pack has been essential in helping me kill time during these trips . 
the blackberry battery does not do justice to the phone . 
this case is the perfect fit for your hand and pocket . 
i use it too much not to have one in the car at all times . 
the extra length does wonders for my iphone . 
i finally stepped up and got excellent knives . 
we are always running out of string to tie chicken ,  roasts ,  herbs . 
otherwise this is a great item and i hope to be able to use it for quite awhile . 
all in all very happy with the look and feel of the product . 
lovely heavy crystal ,  good price ,  not cut glass but looks very nice for holiday tables . 
again ,  it is a wonderful tool to use ,  could be a bit more ergonomic on the grip end . 
it s sizeable and pretty with a rich scarlet color . 
this model also seems geared toward the people who use headsets because the operation is very similar . 
the iphone charges quickly ,  although i ve never timed it . 
it wasn t as slick ,  so it didn t clean as easily nor release food as easily . 
the lid attaches and comes off easily all the time ,  and the parts are easy to clean . 
i wish i d have found these sooner before my sink got scuffed up . 
just be sure not to over fill it !  . 
i have to say ,  i have not had a problem with mine . 
dangerous and unneccesary as this tool is priced so reasonably . 
coffee is hot and stays hot for at least num_num minutes . 
when seated in the cup ,  the strainer does not tip over . 
the front casing has a hard plastic cover that protects the entire phone screen . 
muffins ?  all the same size ?  oh i think that would be nice !  i m glad i bought them . 
it is also good as a mixing bowl . 
i keep both of them but i haven t used the presto for num_num months now . 
works well . saves on paperreduces concerns with possible chemicals and contaminants on paper filter . conical shape . 
i have a recipe for it so i ll be using it soon . 
i received this sauceboat ,  about num_num weeks ago . 
it s nice and thick ,  so i don t worry about breaking it . 
should store somewhere on top for easy winding . 
a light wipe with a dry paper towel works . 
i used to own an older model and after several years it was just wearing out . 
you need to squeeze and twist around the bottle only once and the foil flakes off . 
bought an additional one for our num_extend wheel and also one for our daughter . 
always protect your phone with an otter box . 
i had one for many years and lost it ,  so i was really glad to see this design again . 
this battery is still keeping up with no problems after over a year . 
i received it num_num days earlier than expected . 
they tend to look at a picture and then try to assemble it from that . 
it works as a compact vessel for a picnic lunch too . a drawback is that the containers are plastic . 
this is one of the clearest headsets i have every owned . 
the houdini actually works the way it clams it will . 
both pans cleaned up well even without putting them in the dishwasher . 
the galaxy note num_extend for example ,  is designed to operate with a num_num amp charger . 
the machine does gurgle but very easy to correctin sum ,  i m happy to have gotten this product . 
adding num_num tbsp of plain vodka will keep the yogurt from freezing into a block . 
then i sweeten up the puree d fruit with the simple syrup . 
my knives were scraping against my honing stick inside my  too  small knife bag . 
these are perfect in length and design for flash  thumb  drives . 
especially because the front snaps on and covers the whole edge with out covering my button . 
but for protecting the countertop from heat ,  scratches ,  stains ,  etc . 
it acts and looks exactly like the one that came packaged with my phone ,  and it works great . 
you just hear it speak in your ear :   new text message from frank pikowski . 
these bowls are very nicely sized . i like that it is very easy to store these . 
i did a lot of research before deciding to pay the  big bucks  for this pot . 
another positive function of the design is that they are comfortable to wear . 
nice quality and easy to put on the board . 
can t wait to grind some fresh lamb minus all the fat the grocery stores add . 
it does everything i need ,  and i like the rubberized coating on the buttons . 
it fits great and i barely know it s there . 
it s good for keeping hot oil and your hands separate and it is well made . 
unlike the built in bluetooth in my previous car . 
it seems to charge pretty fast too ,  so i highly recommend the new trent . 
it is made of plastic ,  so i have to be very careful when loading the motorola bionic . 
you can not notice once it is hung . 
coffee comes out hot ,  like it ought to ,  and flavorful . 
this is a phone issue so i ll update the review if i ever figure this out . strongly recommended . 
previously i ve made the soup in a pot and just let it cook away for a couple of hours . 
no issues with the bluetooth fading but i haven t tried going more than num_num ft or so . 
when i was finally able to place this second order ,  the price had been raised by $
matches the interior lighting of my infiniti well . 
normally i cook eggs in the morning and meats and veggies at night . 
this is a great scale for weighing packages to mail . 
but will give it a go and report later . 
arrived on time ,  fair price and i will buy again . 
i also bought this case for my boyfriend and he loved it . 
i can use it almost for everything in baking and in whipping . 
i m an oxo fan and haven t been disappointed yet by their products . 
it s the cooler  koolatron  that doesn t work efficiently and it got sent back . 
it lets me cook a larger homemade pizza that the smaller round stone that i also use . 
i got the crazyondigital one in blue on amazon for less than four bucks altogether . 
lukken must be very ,  very thin so a pizzele iron wouldn t do for the purist . 
the spring is compressed and doesn t do anything or not that i could tell . 
i forgot how good fresh popped popcorn tasted with just a little butter and salt . 
it s a num_num cup pyrex dish .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . don t expect to cook a turkey in it . 
on my previous krups ,  you had to get eye level with the display to read num_extend
i have used the phone for a bout a month without any protector . 
i bought these in conjunction with the hepa filters that were needed for my air cleaner . 
new design pouring shield is a change that was needed . 
i found a wonderful recipe book to go with the packages . 
now i just wash them with a sponge . 
it feels like i could pull the center pin out of the marble . 
just the right size to get the job done and still tuck in the drawer . 
it cuts fruits and potatoes very good and vegetables like carrots just okay . 
my kiddo thought it was the coolest lunch i ve ever packed . 
i use it about once a week to make pastry dough ,  and it whips it up like a dream . 
clean and dirty water tanks click on and off with minimum hassle . lightweight . 
it didn t change the effectiveness in any way . 
but ,  it feels sturdy ,  and dishes things out well enough ,  could stand to have a slightly more powerful spring . 
i have not tried to make pancakes or crepes on it . 
have worked great ,  had them for a while now . 
just be sure to wash them by hand and treat them like the investment that they are . 
i have a few words of advise though . 
have used it on the road a lot and love it . 
i have been on a popcorn kick and this is a good buy . 
i do wish the on off button was easier to access on the top . 
however ,  it charged phone twice ,  and ipad num_num times . 
i liked the fact that my bacon was perfectly cooked under the press . 
you get a  y  charging cable ,  external battery charger and a spare bb num_extend battery . 
one thing i am worried about is the cushion around the screen . 
i ordered this product for my windows surface rt and it works perfectly . 
the basket is big and i can use it for elephant garlic which i love . 
he loves it and used it several times a week . 
maybe they just need time like they had on the iphone ,  who knows . 
this pot is perfect for stews ,  soups ,  meatballs and sauce or just cooking spaghetti . 
have fun researching which one is best for your specific needs !  . 
this is my second cuisinart coffee maker ,  and it makes the very best coffee . 
this works great on a laptop ,  but not so great on a desktop . 
these work perfect , are heavy duty construction ,  look nice ,  and can stay out of the way . 
it s not the best pepper mill but it s definitely a decent one with the price . 
another perk of this phone is that it is unlocked from the start and no hassle with carriers . 
i bought this steamer for my daughter for her birthday . 
sometimes you have to click a few times to get the dough to let go ,  but it still works . 
i could go on and on about the kitchenaid ,  there s no greater mixer than this . 
the quality of lecreuset is excellent and i would not hesitate to recommend it . 
the jars i did use were only ok and one exploded . 
i first used the  brownie  pan to make twice baked potatoes . 
my wife uses this several times a week . 
i never go to starbucks anymore for coffee . 
good solid product for a very reasonable price . 
i am hoping it is better though since i have been using the stock battery for num_num years now . 
they match the rest of the stainless in my kitchen and look great on the wall . 
it will absorb more shock than a plastic hard case . 
when i cook big meals ,  i tire of having to rewash it . this is my second bench scraper . 
i can t believe i waited this long to buy a pressure cooker . 
the filter gets things stuck to it  pet hair , lent , etc .   and has to be cleaned or  vacuumed  off . 
good fit ,  plugs in easy and stays plugged in . 
not perfect ,  mind you ,  but pretty darn good . 
this keeps wine fresher if we have left over wine . 
i will try to post some pictures of my cookies as they really were adorable . 
 i just don t recommend the pasta maker plates for any kitchenaid i have no regrets with this machine . 
the crust is hot and crispy ,  not like from the microwave . 
unless you re physically challenged or very ,  very weak ,  it s not a big deal ,  but heavy enough to stay put . 
so far i ve tried it with guacamole and pesto and it works great . 
they are much more resistant to scratches than the num_extend variety . 
this has limited it to our odyssey van ,  which has the power plugs down and out of the way . 
i think this one will last as long or longer . 
the seasoning on the pan was ok but i had to reseason again as recommended by lodge . 
this brand is a very good brand with quality merchandise . 
great for candies ,  chocolates ,  fondant ,  dough ,  bread ,  you name it . 
the peeler feels solid in hand  what would heidegger say ?   ,  feels durable ,  not num_extend
they are so very superior to those generic ,  cheap wooden spoons with thin handles that are uncomfortable to hold . 
i was happy to see this size ,  which is hard to find ,  on amazon . 
when it arrived ,  i could barely lift the package by myself . 
i replaced it with an htc surround ,  which barely lasted num_num months under the same conditions . 
it will take maybe about an hour or so to sufficiently heat up a larger room . 
if you cook at all ,  you ll love this . 
i had two others that just didn t work well . 
love this thing ,  and i m probably never going to buy another car charger as long as i live . 
fast shipping ,  good packing .  .  .  . i actually bought this to make cookies . 
i bought this for my mother and she loves it . 
if i held it pushed in it makes the connection ,  but once i let it go the connection ends . 
with so few options out there for an older blackberry product this was a wonderful find . 
very quiet ,  three speed and small enough to not blow papers around . 
but overall i am very pleased with the num_extend battery pack . 
amazon delivered it quicker than i expected and i was ready to try it out . 
it fits great in a pocket and very unobtrusive . 
it brews coffee to taste as well as an expensive large coffee maker . 
i bought the num_num quart dutch oven in march num_extend
i absolutly love this piece ,  i m buying more . 
second it s small size takes up no room in a small kitchen . 
i imagine this thing will last forever if taken care of !  . 
fits great currently ,  and good price with freeshipping !  very well worth the price . 
for the price i love this phone and am soooo happy to have it . 
the mesh tip makes such a difference in its functionality . 
i also used one for my torch and they went on smooth and have had not issues . 
one ,  but the reviews made me think twice ,  so i got this one and don t regret a bit !  . 
i am using it with slippers and it just perfect . 
fit and finish as great and feels good in the hand . 
the bottoms are completely flat  no indentation  and the edges are curved . 
i wanted one a little wider ,  but i m glad of the size now . 
but i m getting used to it ,  so no harm done . 
however it is a little difficult to get back off . 
she can just plug it in and go . 
so far it has passed the one hour test . 
i m serious about my coffee and this braun is up to the job . 
it takes me less time to slice the bread and my arm doesn t get worn out . 
works great and shipped fast !  the battery looks just like the original battery the phone comes with . 
the second hard case shields the phone from crushing force if accidentally applied . 
the first time i ordered this item ,  it was lost in the mail . 
less sticking ,  more even cooking of sausages and bacon ,  which i use them for . 
i am very pleased with this set and with its quality . 
too much iron is suspected to increase atherosclerosis . 
i needed a replacement for the pan that fits in the toaster oven . 
after i ve used them for a couple months . 
he does healthy cooking demos and this was perfect for his take a long chefs kit . 
i am very pleased with this prodct my brother loved it . 
so ,  stay with amazon as seller and fullfilment and do the bass boost test !  !  . 
once properly adjusted ,  they stay put even during strenuous movement . 
the special cycles for toast using frozen or regular bread work wonderfully . 
i use the larger pan for cooking chapatis as well . 
the case is so cute and the color is very vibrant and loud . 
and for the price ,  it works very well indeed . 
this takes much less force to squeeze the garlic through . 
things like maple syrup are a real challenge because they almost glue the cap to the bottle . 
having a doctor s appointment has become an all day affair . 
this case ,  in the gray version ,  looks very neat ,  clean and professional mounted on my new white iphone . 
i did also crack this but it was in attempting to remove it while cleaning it . 
i didn t want to do a review until i used it for a while . so far ,  it s great . 
becca from my crazy good life recommended this charger . 
it is a sunbeam product; sunbeam is owned by the jarden corporation ,  a collector of distressed companies . 
it s so easy to grab it and restore sharp blades for whatever cutting job you re doing . 
it took a dozen emails with laza to agree to refund the additional shipping . 
but it only works with usb powered devices . 
gps is very well integrated ,  and the windows mobile platform is incredibly convenient . 
i d finally found my cell phone a cover . both my wife and i like this cover . 
i got this pan for free with my amazon gift certificates from doing surveys . 
don t recommend for more than num_num a time . 
i default to this more than to my food processor . 
if you really like cold beer ,  you will love these . 
mario batali says they replace their nonstick cookware at babbo once every few months . 
there was no sign of anything falling into the food . 
in summary ,  attractive and easy to use all at a reasonable  economical  price . 
this cuts the grease way down ,  but the salt is still there . 
you can t even tell that it s there unless you look really carefully . 
the hole for the front cam can be punched out . 
i got this for my daughter s iphone num_extend
we ve had this for probably a year and it s still going strong . 
we have now ordered three different times through amazon and returned every box because they were all too small . 
the original battery was num_extend and this one is num_extend
it seems plantronics has come out with a new version of the num_extend
i couldn t make soup ingredients or frying vegetables without it . 
num_extend for the price ,  the materials should be of higher quality ,  it s constructed of average feeling plastics . 
they re not cheap ,  but there s a reason for that . 
i love it and although i have many cases this might just be my favorite one . 
it arrived sooner than expected too !  rubberized feel with chrome accents make it very masculine !  . 
i have had it last for about num_num hours max . 
i ve even charged my portable battery packs and my dslr camera when i was on the road . 
i got one of these before they were eligible for amazon prime so wound up paying $ for shipping . 
i have been very pleased with it ,  though i will note it is best suited for oranges and smaller . 
i also haven t paid too much attention to how long it takes to get the phone that far . 
sometimes it was effective and at other times i still couldn t get the bottle open . 
 it d be num_num stars if the aforementioned improvements were made .  p . s . 
it does amplify your music ,  though it enhances the tinny quality of the iphone s speakers . 
after getting this one for my kitchen i can see why . 
i use a mug warmer to keep the coffee hot while i m sipping it . 
i ve found the plantronics are the most comfortable ,  secure and easiest to use . 
i cook both scratch and mix and love the trader joe s mix . 
these measuring spoons are great ,  they are very heavy duty no flimsiness . 
trying to complete my wife s knife set ,  i bouht this carving set . 
these cutting boards are cheap and super easy to clean . 
i am very impressed; enough i got it for my mother and will recommend it to others . 
esp with the extra num_num inches of depth this is a nice sized little unit . 
needed to be able to charge all my batteries at once and this does the trick . 
they are not covered at all by the case ,  absolutely no problems pressing them and getting response from them . 
now if i can just get better at putting them on . 
with a rubberized well labeled handle cover ,  they make for comfortable easy to access measuring . 
they are perfectly sized for the pizza recipe that i have use from my num_extend betty crocker cookbook . 
this size fits my oven rack perfectly at num_num x num_extend
if you re traveling with a laptop ,  you don t need to drag along the ac adapter to charge the headset . 
the little guide that comes with the cooker has helpful little charts . 
sure ,  using it daily ,  it s beginning to show a little wear ,  but not much . 
wish it had a couple more as you usually cook more that one dish at a time . 
i bought the onyx pro num_num num_num mos ago . 
otherwise the ice cream will be real runny . 
i only wish it were a bit bigger ,  i almost always need two cuts to cut a pizza . 
this does the trick and looks great in my kitchen . 
my only negative is that it has it s own charger . 
other times it s more expensive and shipping is not included . 
i just wish the cord was a tiny bit longer . 
i like it and i highly recommend it . 
hopefully that white will be less prone to turning grey . 
all you do is blend some soap and water in it . 
the only down side is that now it doesn t fit the belt clip pouch that i bought for it . 
this does an great job of charging my samsung galaxy . 
i use this masher at least three times a week and it does a great job . 
i have nothing else to say about them . 
the  eyer  is not sharp so soft fruits or vegetables gets a little smashed  tomatoes  . 
i called kitchenaid and was told that this is normal . 
if you dont pound in the supports far enough into the slots ,  your doors wont fit right . 
i don t really open that many bottles ,  though ,  so i feel sure this will be perfect for me . 
i used the meat grinder and it worked pretty good . 
they work great and i don t have any complaints to make about them . 
i ve this for coffee beans ,  flax seeds ,  and even for small nuts jobs  hehe  . 
it s great for carrots ,  zucchini ,  squash ,  potatoes ,  eggplant ,  etc . 
the reason this works is that it cuts the side of the lid through the lip . 
we have lots of active people in our house and drink a lot of cold water . 
its a great investment and well worth the price . pros :  good speed settings from high to low . 
to make things worse ,  i spend my days in the shop in our basement . 
about num_num years ago i decided to organize my spice cabinet . 
i have had it leak once or twice ,  but it was due to one of those reasons . 
this one you can program two phone to it . 
we ve never had one before ,  but this brand received good reviews from other users . 
its a little heavy and generally requires num_num hands ,  but its worth it . 
i always catch them on something and that yanks the phones off my ears . 
and i should note that i am not careful with my phones . 
i have bought several of these for others in the office . 
would probably be even tastier with coconut oil ,  but it is expensive in quantity less than num_num gallon . 
but sinced this is designed to go inside the leather case it works great . 
the word  small  in the product description is an understatement . 
was a little weary about this purchase after reading other reviews . 
i bought this to use and experiment with crystals and making designs on the case . 
the lamb leather is rigid which makes the outer shell more durable than having a softer outer shell . 
she gave me the oxo garlic press and advised me it no longer worked . 
it arrived quickly ,  same day i received the epic . 
i have dropped it on multiple occasions while using this case and it hasn t been damaged at all . 
but after making num_num ounces of coffee in the chemex ,  i find that it s quite a pain . 
the only thing i would warn about is sticking it on the fridge using the magnet it comes with . 
easy !  the rolls were well packaged and delivery was as expected . 
i am not the type to wear a bluetooth on my ear . 
great for walking down the street as well ,  as the earpiece isn t extremely noticeable . 
it is great that you can remove the two grilling sections ,  which make for much easier clean up . 
it fits perfectly except for some minor alteration at the battery connection point . 
but it will pay for itself by the convenience and the reduction in energy costs . 
i have snaped the holder off of two so be careful when clipping on something thick . 
the hard rubber grip is comfortable and definitely helps when trying to get out the hardest of ice creams . 
if i needed another fan ,  i would buy this one again . 
the only maintenance i ve done is to clean it up and fiddle with the igniter . 
this lid is not too pliable which makes me think it will maintain its shape and hence its seal . 
i was surprised that the directions called for hot tap water . 
so i upgraded to asharpstone hand crank herb grinder ,  and really liked it for awhile . 
what i didn t know was that it was just a bit too flimsy for several common tasks . 
it will make the toughest cut of meat so tender that it falls apart . 
this funnel makes that weekly job far easier as well as canning jobs . 
easy to read red measure markings are in cups ,  ounces ,  and milliliters . 
a bit pricey ,  but so convenient it s a wash . 
i was worried about people saying it might crack ,  etc . 
these tongs are so nice that i just ordered a second pair . 
very easy to use and it is not too heavy to take out and put away if necessary . 
don t be put off by the look of this skimmer . 
the groove along the edges is also a plus for catching any juices . 
i don t understand why even my local kitchen specialty store doesn t carry them . 
i still have and use ,  good price ,  feels cheap ,  but works . 
if there is one thing that is not perfect ,  it s the hook that s provided to hang the cups with . 
this works perfectly !  the seal is very tight so no need to worry about spills . 
since this battery charges so fast ,  you are not kicking yourself for forgetting to plug in your phone . 
a good hint to keep the mess low is to get one for every guest . 
even the kids find it easier to scoop out ice cream on their own . 
we have used this mainly for the standard and whole wheat modes . 
these were purchased to make cookie lollipops at christmas . 
but to my surprised i think amco have reenforced the handles on these cups and made the handle thicker . 
i got good use out of it ,  so great value for the money . 
i hoped this steamer would replace that one ,  plus give me more steam cleaning options . 
it was beautiful ,  and sturdy ,  and really a piece of kitchen art . 
it holds as much as an extra large coffee mug . 
keep it from getting we are it will loose it s shape . 
that s why i have friedrich b as well . 
so i bought it and couldn t be happier . 
this product is worth those extra num_num bucks . 
these are perfect for lunches and small bits of leftovers . 
i received these to make english muffin bread ,  thinking they would be the perfect size and they are . 
thank you ,  amazon !  not only is the gripper handle perfect ,  the blade works as it should . 
i was buying num_num dollar thermos from bimart ,  they broke the lid or seal every year . 
however ,  it has a very large and heavy crockery insert that is difficult to handle and wash . 
note that you need to have software on your nexus num_num to do that . 
the cost for a replacement hepa is significant so i think i ll just buy a new unit . 
good price and hope they will provide service like their earlier versions . 
who can t spare a few seconds for the convenience this spray offers . 
again ,  double batch ! at any rate ,  it s a good pan ,  but tough to clean the corners . 
then i got smart and used a pin adapter and plugged directly into the wall . 
i know they have to be cheaper than buying bags already donebecause i can make any size i want . 
i have the same function on my casio watch ,  but it s too cumbersome to be useful . 
all in all i love this spatula from kitchenaide . 
great case ,  looks so cool and so many people loved it !  it makes your phone look awesome . 
i have used this extended battery for almost num_num months after getting a replacement battery . 
just be careful do not try to cut bones with it !  i tried it once . 
even with all that ,  it is a very good product at a very good price . 
this is the best knife for cutting and slicing cheese .  .  .  . and a great price too !  . 
it even has a recipe to make your own buttercream icing . 
candle flame is low enough the butter will not scorch and burn . 
did i sell it at a yard sale ?  don t know where it went ,  anyway . decided recently to can again . 
it s simple ,  black and easy to change up my phone covers every week . 
then ,  you pour the batter ,  close the lid ,  and turn the handle . 
hard to clean and the freezer container take up a ton of room in the freezer . 
i would buy this again as it was pretty easy to make these fully accessible . 
this small capacity coffee maker is perfect for couples who want coffee at different times of the day . 
hopefully not ,  but i will save the box just in case it konks out . 
i am not unhappy with my purchase ,  but wish the ad had been clearer in the beginning . 
i bought this all clad on warehouse deals as a return . 
some people that i have shown the case to did comment that they did not like the extra heft . 
in fact ,  i am thinking of picking up a second spare . 
i sometimes toss them back in from the front . 
this tab is pretty prominent in the glamor shots of the case . 
it s a nice addition too for very little money . 
this is my second anker smart phone battery . 
when i took it out of the box ,  couldn t beleive how big around the handle was . 
even then it may fluctuate a tiny bit . i stuck it in ice water and it read num_extend
i threw mine away and just store the knife in the drawer . 
like the way the cases work and with the swivel belt clip worked great . 
bought this to replace an old  teflon  coated pan . 
the device is naturally larger  to accomodate the big screen  and i ve not found that to be a problem . 
i do keep it out on my counter . 
i m glad i bought the cuisinart blade and disc holder . 
previously ,  i had to touch a directional arrow in order to navigate and swiping is just so much easier . 
this is the perfect chord to use when travelling . 
it cleans easily and heats up the water ,  unlike the french press pot . i is inexpensive and not bad looking . 
i have only installed it but have not gone out for a ride yet . 
i do see it s selling now for about $
i have tried alot of zesters and graters . 
i can t imagine how anyone could have trouble unpacking it . 
i bought this to use with my mini muffin tin . 
they do use plastic parts that if abused ,  may break . 
i am not a fan of molasses in breads .  .  . the taste is too strong .  .  . i use brown sugar instead .  .  . much better flavor . 
i will be very satisfied if the next num_num months are as trouble free as the first four . 
thick wall construction gives me confidence that this unit is safe and will last my lifetime . 
i ve never used for anything other than making sparkling water and it works great . 
but i think it s manageable . anyway ,  in sum ,  i am very happy with this purchase . 
i never had used a steamer basket before i ordered this item . 
this pan offers the high quality of the nordic ware cake pans . 
it would be hard to screw them up . 
i wanted a quiche pan with a removable bottom to make a few tarts and quiches . this works great . 
since i was replacing most of my pans ,  going with a set was the best value for my money . 
its plastic and exactly was what they promised . 
nice for reaching in the over to adjust foods . 
you could also make a fantastic raspberry coulis . 
so i m stuck with a four hundred dollar dyson that fails to meet some of my performance requirements . 
i bought this one as a gift for my daughter . 
i got this and tracked down some coconut oil . 
do they work as well ?  who knows !  not me . because tears are gonna fall ,  rolling in the deep . 
i ordered the scone pan wondering if it would make much of a difference in ease of preparation . 
i use stainless bowls ,  and this spatula works great . 
it brought a full num_num gallons of water to a boil faster than i could have imagined . 
turn it on and it beeps when it s ready . 
you re the barista ,  you stop it when you re ready . 
you can easily charge two devise at once ,  but the num_extend a will charge faster . 
if you use a box cutter on the wrong end ,  you will slit the seat . shipment was fast . 
but the legs can also come in if you don t want them to take up that much real estate . 
spend the extra couple of bucks on the real deal . 
fixed my daughters phone that got dropped in a glass of water . 
i hoped they had improved the plastic strainer . dang ,  not so much . 
out they went and enter this amco set . 
at full power ,  it gets too warm for me . 
a car charger is just one of those things you need . 
you really can t ever go wrong with buying a case from otterbox . 
i have in the past allowed the stock pot to simmer away for days on end . 
my only fault would be that the handles and get very hot but i expected that . 
it s used twice a week to process three to four pounds of vegetables at one time . 
and yeah ,  it s fun to play sega ,  nintendo games using the  free  emulators . 
i received this for christmas since it was on my wish list . 
the instructions said to use vaseline as a lubricant when putting the blade back on ,  so i did that . 
if i had num_num hands ,  i would have bought three . 
depth is much nicer than the standard num_num in . 
no need to spread anything on the inside of the bread . 
i am very pleased with the quality of this product . 
i used them for scones and biscuits and shortbread and they worked great . 
i can reliably get num_num charges from single digits to % plus another to %
it holds num_num oz which is a good num_extend
just love it !  so much better than the food processors of years ago . 
i used hershey s syrup  about num_num tbsp  and added it to the milk . 
the quick start guide was a masterpiece of clarity ,  and the instruction manual filled in minute details . 
the kitchenaid mixer i received as a wedding gift along time ago sufferred a recent demise . 
also excellent as a headset when making calls . 
i received it on time and they work great . 
a soft inner core that you install and then the hard case over it . 
i have had anker batteries for several different model phones now ,  and the quality is great throughout . 
this is the fourth one i have purchased as gifts . 
i have had them now for months and the smaller bases are not an issue . 
it wasn t that bad though ,  like a leaning tower of piece of hot beverage holder ,  but it bothers me . 
this blackberry charger works fine with my motorola droid . 
there really isn t much to review on a screen protector . 
but definitely the short glasses fare well in the dishwasher . 
i use corningware for just about all my cooking and serving needs . 
once i wetted them they were just fine and have been stuck on for num_num months straight . 
the best case i can really tell everyone about and they wont be upset . 
it works well but would have liked remote to work . 
have used this attachment twice and am quite pleased with it . 
when we moved in the folks bought us a similiar model that we used endlessly . 
this is a great inexpensive way to make espresso at home . 
i find it very difficult to get the lids on the dishes . 
i have always tried wheatgrass and it juiced it with ease . 
this is definitely not a heavyweight set but it is great for cooking pasta . 
the mix must be allowed to cool in fridge for a few hours . 
i purchased an extra sugar bowl for sweetener and a tray from all clad . 
the only complaint i have is it could be louder ,  but it serves my purpose . 
my honey said this one was the best he s ever used . 
haven t tasted it yet and hope it it doesn t overwhelm the icing . 
it makes for a much sturdier product than the plastic housed one . 
yep ,  i wash all my veges and fruit with it . 
just throw that away ,  quickly rinse the base and its all done . 
the attachments mentioned above twist very easily onto the beater shaft and i found unlocking them no problem . 
the first one i purchased lasted about num_num years with practically daily use . 
i ve also found that it cleans up easily after a quick soaking . 
he needed extra protection for his phone due to hard on the phone and kids dropping it . 
i ve been looking for a small skillet that wasn t coated with teflon for quite some time . 
these stylus work just as they are supposed to . 
i do like it and it has been very useful . 
used it to slice roast beef ,  swiss cheese and baked turkey breast . 
this was a cute case i enjoyed it . 
make your own pork breakfast sausage without all the bad additives and enjoy . 
they are definitely not flimsy ,  and the rubber grips on the handle make them easy to hold on to . 
but ordering the bags from witbecks adds to the superiority of the experience . 
my husband and i got them as a wedding gift . 
wanting to get away from plastic ,  i purchased these and another brand  ziploc versa glass  . 
just a light cleaning after use and they are ready to go again . 
just liked the way the lids sat and easy to load . 
the color matches my mixer and its made well . 
i don t like to use the gas burners but we do like our eggs in the morning . 
i have dropped my phone several times with the case on and it has survived so far . 
this size fits in my aga oven ,  which is smaller than most . 
i cannot compare it to any other potato cutter because this is the only one i have used . 
further it has two settings :  high brings the humidity up quickly; low keeps the air moist . 
removes stuck on food residue very gently ,  while still preserving a thin layer of seasoning or patina . 
i picked up a second one of these and put them both under the bathroom cabinet . 
it works great for plates ,  glasses ,  cups etc . 
i guess the handles are placed close to each other because they wanted to keep the packaging small . 
nevertheless these filters are worth it preventing wet grounds from overflowing . 
it seems to be durable to me but i ve only used them as freezer storing containers for leftovers . 
these are just what i have been looking for . 
clean the knife and the vegetable and very slowly make the first cut . 
i ordered this case from a different website since it was not available for a long time on amazon . 
it s brand new and did a fabulous job today . 
bought for mom she likes it a lot . 
or  call home  is more easily understood than  call abe lincoln  . 
for my first case ,  i love it and so will you . 
this product is perfect fit for the phone designed for . 
yes ,  you need to know where to be careful ,  but you ll definitely enjoy the coffee . the important stuff . 
these are nice sturdy measuring cups ,  and the company has clearly fixed the handle problem . 
i found no problems programing the timer or setting the unit to make coffee . 
so easy to clean !  and i use them daily for all my cutting and chopping . 
i have had many pepper mills before and all of them fall short in some aspect or another . 
nothing beats a gas stove top and a good heavy wok !  . 
if you feel like you have to force it ,  then you are overdoing it . 
it is a must have for your phone . 
not an issue for me ,  because i always let it oscillate . 
with this dispenser i can get just a half sheet ,  whole sheet ,  or whatever i want . 
this is probably the best and safest case anyone can buy for their iphone num_extend
coffee is one thing i drink a lot of every day and don t want to live without . 
got to have these for the popper to work . 
perhaps that is the issue some had with it . 
water at my place comes a little turbid for some reason and this stuff gets it clean . 
 i use a giant strainer for this ,  makes it super easy  . 
bleach comes in big bottles that are difficult to pour . 
it was still good but didn t work as well . overall ,  this is a very good product . 
i wish there were a way to attach this to my phone . 
this one is a lot easier to clean and store than the krups and works as well . 
some shakers are hard to pour from since the strainer easily clogs with ice . 
the case makes the phone heavy and almost three times as thick as the normal phone . 
it works great ,  makes excellent waffles; cleaning is fairly easy  i have no basis for comparison here  . 
ballistic has proven to be a great long lasting product . 
but ,  playing around with this ,  i learned this is a great way to make mashed or smashed potatoes . 
i would recommend it to anyone it s worth the money . 
well worth the the price and so wonderful to use . 
we use a tap filter to fill it up ,  and keep it in the fridge for use . 
instructions say to sight down the slicer to adjust evenly by eye . 
this case definitely does not have that problem and buttons are fairly easy to press ,  but avoid accidental presses . 
the only thing i didn t like about the era is the fit ,  for me just wasn t there . 
if i lose one or choose to share them i have plenty . 
they are very sharp and the blades are nice and fine  thin  . 
would match any decor ,  so it always looks nice on my table !  . 
but it does not protect the phone from water damage if you drop it into water . 
it really help keep things for sticking and burning . 
seems to work well on various type of equipment . 
fortunately this occurred as we were thinning the herd and sending our kids off in to the world . 
i rarely need to dip the head in hot water at all . 
 duh !   has so many attachments which look really cool . 
what the earpiece has is a button that transmits  volume up  and  volume down  to the phone . 
i cant quite describe the finish of this case but it feels very good . 
according to the instruction manual ,  the switch changes the recovery time of the waffle iron . 
i was always prone to overcooking and burning my popcorn in the microwave ,  anyway . 
i don t know how they would hang any differently though . 
the other thing would be the possible addition of more usb ports . 
excellent for garnishes to adding the full fresh flavor of citrus zest without any of the bitter pith . 
the plastic even has a small nick and it still hold up . 
if you get burned residue inside ,  which you will ,  just do a soak and use some baking soda . 
they stack up well with each other ,  and should be no problem placing them anywhere within easy reach . 
this is pretty straight forward ,  but i wonder how i ever managed before . 
 refund he still wanted to buy me a nice coffee machine for christmas . 
suprising battery life ,  which is a good thing ,  given the battery is not user num_extend
yet the num_extend is a full featured ,  high quality headset . 
i broke my carafe and there is no replacement for the real thing . 
i ve found several touch and iphone cases that simply will not work with this cable . 
there are some stuff that i didn t know about the product though . 
the temp is preset and uniform which seems to work as we never have burned food or undercooked food . 
america s test kitchen rated this as one of the best so i bought it . 
i works so well that i m going to order the next size up to complete the set . 
getting back to this lesson book .  .  . you will be extremely ,  extremely happy . 
i have counterparts in two remote offices and we spend a lot of time on the phone . 
once you use this one you will not want to use any other corkscrew . 
they fit my num_extend old son perfectly . the neck band is kind of flimsy . 
it was sweeter . i am so glad we bought the breville . 
you can read the amounts from inside or out ,  eliminating all guesswork !  . 
 it s easy to try different flavors when you are using old corn .  i did buy a new nordic popper . 
it has the full buttons and hasn t fallen apart like so many others i have had . 
it heats evenly on an electric stove and has held up well . 
mine doesn t leak ,  and the construction is good . 
low speed provides strong airflow with moderate noise . 
the new trent num_num is the best accessory i have for my iphone num_extend
of course ,  they are not waterford ,  but waterford is $
the num_extend was also a bit more comfortable in my ear . 
the blade can be flipped over for different uses . 
so they do not bake as well as this heavier pan does . 
keeps the fish from sticking when done . clean up is not that bad . 
this is attractive ,  sturdy ,  and goes over the mixer easily . 
they are easy to cut even on bread and i get a nice clean cut . 
i found this out ,  but oiling the pan took the white ring away . 
it is a good charger ,  nice and thick ,  like pictured . 
it heats the water then i use it . 
this is so convenient for charging my things . 
although the first one was delivered with a cracked lid ,  amazon replaced the whole baker without any difficulty . 
this mount works well with just about any phone . 
i use it for most of my web needs . 
my larger camp dutch ovens would make too much food for just the wife and i . 
i bought this item as a replacement for an older wilton cookie pro . 
i have found it to be very helpful in keeping wires from tangling . 
no bending noted and quick clean up in the dishwasher . 
it s very nice ,  comes with a good rubber case ,  and a hard plastic shell that fits snugly over it . 
no phones currently support all of these bands . 
might take a few hours to get through the bubble wrap ;  . 
baked cakes slide smoothly out of the pan despite any prior lubrication . 
it takes about num_num uses to get used to it . 
people can hear me clearly even in wind . 
the fantastic design and tasty coffee more than make up for these small flaws though . 
perhaps you can do better for $ or more ,  but i haven t tried those expensive options . 
it came in a timely fashion . would buy again !  . 
i avoid following hot coffee with cool rinse water . 
takes me write back to the day when take out came in these wonderful little dishes from heaven . 
i have used a whole box of num_num cartridges already with only one  dud  . 
great buy ,  for a even greater price !  product is as drescribed . 
num_extend my unit died about a month ago ,  but i liked it enough to buy another one . 
buy a car charger ,  or at least have an extra battery with you for a back up . 
i got this booster and i set it up . 
my old wallet was a coach wallet that i spent way too much money on . 
but for cooking burgers and then the buns indoor ,  this grill is top rate . 
easy to use and makes num_num ears with no muss no fuss . 
as i ve mentioned in previous reviews ,  i am a faithful follower of items manufactured by the lodge company . 
with three in each pack ,  i figure i won t have to buy another set until my next phone . 
i ve never been disappointed with any of your products . 
however they are not packaged well ,  and are loose in the box . 
on the negative side ,  they do wear out with frequent use . 
lodge logic has a good reputation for their cast iron products . 
in a normal toaster ,  you d have to dig these small bagels out with wooden tongs . 
this sucker slices my thanksgiving turkey like nobodies business . 
there is never even a hint burned or acid coffee taste . the capresso is a real pleasure to use . 
so i returned it twice under warranty ,  but i give in . 
we ve also found it quite useful for other pollutants and it helps when our allergies start acting up . 
from there ,  the handle is occasionally turned until the mixture freezes . 
i paid $ and it is well worth the price . 
the handle is comfortable and the knife is well balanced . 
one rocker switch turns on the water heater and another the water pump . 
the suction cup gave out as i was removing it to clean my windshield . 
this is a great price for an awesome bluetooth headset !  thanks to the seller and to amazon . 
it s great and my pizza turns out very crispy . 
it s easy to get the phone in and out before and after running . 
like most people i have owned multiple styles of headsets and had varying degrees of success with them . 
i may use it to dish up risotto and casseroles too . 
it can sense when you have it in your ear and has a crisp sound . 
i ve personally used it often enough to justify the purchase . 
i only grind enough for each brewing ,  a four cupper . 
it downloads apps quickly ,  links to your email ,  fb ,  twitter ,  etc . 
some are nylon of various sizes ,  and one is a brass brush for the tough surfaces . 
they are actually good enough to warrant replacing if they ever get lost . 
i use it to make grilled cheese sandwiches in my cast iron frying pan . 
the pan butters itself as the butter rises up when contents are poured into it . 
really good size and low maintenance ,  really recommend this !  . 
i buy them five at a time because i either lose them or they die after a while . 
 perks of being the cook .  also brilliant for ,  you know ,  eggs and bacon ,  etc . 
it comes with several  around num_extend musical ring tones . 
i m hoping that ,  with years of use ,  the surface will get smoother . 
for num_num different people using them ,  that is pretty good . 
i own the vitamix num_extend so my review really applies to that model . 
when you open the double sided  for leverage  handle ,  the pusher moves to the end opposite the blades . 
its water proof incase i drop it in the tolilet by accident as i always do with the kids . 
i prefer sharpening knives on a  steel  rather than abrasive sharpeners and this one seems to work well . 
so i now have num_extend the garlic twist ,  and the alien lime reamer . 
the glass carafe and stainless steem support are of high quality . 
i m still using one of the batteries and i gave the other to a friend . 
i was told it isn t necessary with the maker but it is a useful tool . 
i love it so much !  best and most used machine in my house . 
i got big ears so this thin has to flex to get on my ear . 
it definitely does the job of protecting the phone . 
complete protection for those with the dropsies ?  yes . 
the press is heavy duty and performs well . 
zojirushi excels at this type of coffeemaker  with thermal carafe  because insulated containers was their original business . 
fits well and has stayed on the phone screen . 
i highly recommend this device as the best on the market despise of its price . 
the charger charges my phone fast and the cable does not get all tangled up due to its design . 
the film feels good to the touch and has significantly reduced glare . 
we leave the stone in the oven all the time and there is no sign of cracking . 
got this for a friend who is staying here while translating a manuscript . 
now ,  i always know where my phone it . 
it does not protect the screen if phone falls upside down but i knew of this before getting it . 
so far ,  it has eased her chopping ,  dicing ,  and slicing needs a hundred fold . 
ive used it for longer calls but never heard it say anything but  battery is high  . 
i had no problem powering my ipad num_num with it . 
i successfully charged an ipod touch and a nintendo ds lite . 
this vacuum was not designed to clean large areas . 
i went through many different graters but this one has the best stainless steel quality . 
i don t know what has happened but i have returned to pyrex and found what i was missing . 
i bought this and have been using it on an almost daily basis for about num_extend months . 
my single attempt to do so meant i had to soak the pan overnight and then scrape . 
i had to laugh at another reviewer s comment  does what it s supposed to do  . 
have had this for a few months now . 
i simply forced myself to use them up . 
you must have these if you buy a dehydrator . 
we have had this press for num_num months now ,  and we are completely satisfied . 
i thought it would be a simple matter of drawing the blade smoothly through the slot a few times . 
it works like the description says and had no problems pairing it on my nexus num_extend
i can charge a dead android phone and still have about half a charge left in the powergen . 
it provides good grip and at the same time slides out of pocket very easily . 
the only complaint i have is that it doesn t have a lid . 
this braun served me well for num_num years . 
sometimes a little difficult to empty drip tray if full . 
i ve had this phone for several months now .  .  . works great . 
it would fit better if the phone had a sleeve . 
i looked at a lot of electric kettles to heat water for tea before deciding on this one . 
we were looking for ways to make more room on our kitchen counter top . 
even a fingerprint sensor ,  which to my knowledge no other phone has . 
i recommend getting an additional ,  thinner slicer blade if you want to make coule slaw . 
the instructions are clear ,  and bluetooth setup was easy to connect to the iphone num_extend
i strayed and tried other brands but still prefer pyrex glassware . 
all quality products ,  very reasonably priced through amazon . 
in other words i am pretty damn good at cutting fruit . 
price was right and it really is easy to clean . 
the handle is comfortable and the swivel head makes peeling go much faster . 
the web browser is more than capable of serving your everyday needs including facebook . 
i use them for soup . pasta . any frying meats and potatoes . 
the carbon fiber back is nice however not the reason i purchased it . 
i find the sound quality to be fairly good . 
the clear glass makes them appear elegant and the thickness of the glass makes them suitable for everyday use . 
the kitchenaid hand blender is a quality cooking tool . 
i also like to make different types of bread that you simply cannot find on the shelf . 
many similar utensils are too stiff for the job . 
i have arthritic hands and this handle is super . 
this is not a huge problem ,  but i don t like the feeling that the fit could be better . 
my wife likes being able to use this little gizmo in lieu of the big pot steamer . 
so why is this ?  ?  ?  well it s the voice activation in the unit that raises the cost but wait . 
i love this case ,  because it simply protects the iphone with no worries . 
it still does the job ,  day in and day out ,  every single day of the year . 
it makes a tiny  ,  but hard working vacuum even better . 
it also works great with the amazon apple cables . 
so ,  when i saw this great deal on amazon ,  i decided to replace the old one . 
these are inexpensive ,  stylish ,  easy to assemble ,  efficient wine storage design ,  and are very strong . 
however ,  it probably would also provide just some air movement for warm nights .   . 
then using a bendable straight edge ,  i connected the dots . 
whenever the phone has been dropped while in this case ,  no damage has occurred . 
the only caveate i have is to be certain your existing system is in good repair . 
this actually affects sound quality a bit ,  as it s not fully on the ear . 
i was used to a steam frother ,  which took care of heating the milk at the same time . 
i would highly recommend these glasses if you want to enjoy your everyday wine experience . 
this is a beautiful ,  functional ,  space saving item . 
i purchased this for my wife as a gift to replace her decade old travel mug . 
i would recommend it to any samsung owner to keep with them just in case . 
it seems very simple and does not form to my ear at all . 
the rubber handle is made of a material that doesn t slip in your hands when it gets wet . 
a fun way to present your delicious cakes and desserts . 
i would highly recommend this item especially for the price ,  you can beat it . 
they should offer these instead of regular micro usb cords . 
i rolled over this with my num_extend toolbox ,  and only had a few scratches to show for it . 
so glad i was able to replace them quickly  and using prime shipping !   with amazon . 
it is safe to use and has not damaged any of my batters ,  it won t over charge . 
well i agree with all the reviews this is a fantastic case . 
good quality lg cable very similiar to the one my evo num_extend came with . 
the only handicap of the sleek is the fact that it must be used while in the cradle . 
the lid design is not really complicated at all . 
i am here today ,  to buy yet another one because mine is so old . 
only real complaint is the rubber ear pieces don t fit my ear as tight as i d like . 
it occupies very little space in my shelf . 
that in itself makes it worth the money . 
i m using these in the bathroom to replace the original suction cups on our shower caddy . 
and i don t want to spend a hundred dollars . 
less than num_num minutes later ,  the extremely nice customer service rep had a replacement on rush to my home . 
these sheets are very well made ,  very heavy and i have never experienced warping with these sheets . 
they are very good with stew ,  pot roast and venison . 
there is not too much to say about this item other than it filter my water . 
i don t taste any plastic or off flavor . 
it is as good as some of the better german or japanese ones . 
i need heavy glasses help keep the them from being chipped or cracked by the reefer ice maker . 
until then we are happy with these batteries and a little more life . 
i personally find that to be a practical placement . 
added this larger pot and top after household member burned a smaller version . 
this is a must for me when i m simmering things for a long time . 
it came very quickly and my mother lovess this one too i can t wait to recieve mine soon . 
no leaks while in use and it even has a nice satin finish . 
i d recommend buying them locally and carefully inspecting them to be sure you have ones that are defect free . 
the pur has plastic threads the culligan has metal ,  a much better design . 
i don t worry about them chipping or cracking if i happen to drop them . 
everything positive i see here i concur with . 
i will by only kuhn rikon whisks from now on . 
repeat this same procedure for the second device . 
they use it to charge their ipods when we are on the road . 
i ve bought cell phone mounts before and they all turned out to be junk . 
it works well in both low light and sunlight ,  and offers autofocus ,  flash ,  and many different color overlays . 
pressure cooking is without jars pressure canning is with jars !  !  ! i love that this does not have a gasket . 
out of the box ,  it was exceptionally sharp ,  and has remained so ,  so far . 
you cut up the food ,  put it in the cooker and turn it on . 
these work well and are glass so there is no plastic smell transmitted to your spices . 
if you like these tips ,  you will love my website :   .  .  .   . 
after ordering from amazon it arrived in just a few days . 
absolutely cannot go wrong with one of the babies !  !  !  enjoy !  . 
the cooker comes with a plastic cylinder that has a needle on the end of it . 
simply because there is no other headset to compare a jawbone to . 
but ,  the cups are a troublesome to clean ,  since they are quite narrow . 
it was on my doorstep within num_num days . 
it really does work just like an infomercial . 
i got this product because my husband had one when he was little . 
it immediately connected to my phone and does the same for each family member when they are driving . 
this one works just as well and is a lot better looking than my grandparents one . 
i have owned many can openers and this one is by far the beat . 
at the price amazon is asking ,  this is quite affordable . 
this works great and is fairly easy to clean . 
seems very durable and like the neutral color to blend in nicely in the closet . 
i ve come biased to otterbox products ,  as they ve never let me down . 
perfect for those times the power goes out . 
these heavy duty pans will leave a nice finish on whatever you bake in them . 
each one has worked well ,  and our employees have no trouble using them . 
the one we got was black ,  which is fine . no complaints so far . 
it does bend slightly while baking but will straighten itself out once cooled . cleanup is easy . 
it does the job well and the ergonomics put it over the top . 
this turner is perfect for flaky fish ,  pancakes ,  anything . 
the kit comes with three screen protectors and cloths . 
we use these for all of our dinner parties and always get compliments . 
so when you select num_num cups from the sliding bar ,  its not really num_num cups . 
i attached the plastic round holder to the dashboard  the sticky tape is very good ,  num_extend makes it  . 
this can be found in the included manual . 
very happy to have this and am drinking a lot more iced tea because i always have some made . 
love this  ,  recommend it to everyone and have since purchased num_num or more as gifts and giveways . 
i highly recommend this case !  !  protect your evo with the best !  !  . 
this charged my iphone num_num a time and a half past the normal battery life . 
i noticed some reviewers are reporting that the case is slippery . 
this indoor grill is great even in a small living area . 
it is a somewhat light green with some cloudy white mixed in . 
note :  this case does not fit the new num_extend case definitely looks and feels more expensive than it is . 
it heats water very quickly ,  like most do ,  but this has many more features . 
it is strong and heavy and i can t imagine having to buy another for as long as i m around . 
the earbuds are comfortable to wear for long hours and do a good job keeping out noise . 
i found the same at walmart under the name mainstays . 
it takes up little space on any stove ,  and it has helpful measuring marks on the inside . 
we do not use this grinder for coffee because we have a burr grinder for that . 
this pan isn t much more expensive than the cheap versions ,  and the results are well worth the difference . 
this bag i then throw into the trash . 
don t ever use it on the high setting . 
after using it for a while its glossy appearance turn into a worn ,  scratched look . 
thank you kitchenaid for making such a beautiful and functional product . 
i keep it in my kitchen except to put it outside on recycle days . 
the one thing i worry about is the flash on the back ,  though i have not tried it . 
i ve been struggling with keeping the battery charged in mysamsung num_extend captivate android smartphone galaxy s  unlocked  . 
this item has helpful indicator lights on each button . 
it shows am and pm ,  and can be locked . 
i finally found a large size perfect for big parties !  the best moka at the right price . 
you don t need tools; everything lifts out easily . 
i have had this crockpot for years now and i use it for everything . 
i will let you know the outcome of the customer service . 
i was fortunate it came out without a single trapped dirt or bubble . 
i primarily use it in our laundry room to vacuum cat litter tracking off of a tile floor . 
then you add water and fill it up to the graduated mark on the inside of the pot . 
the capacity is very close to advertised ,  but works hard to recharge my nook color at num_extend
i special order movie theater popcorn from someplace in idaho just to get the best . 
we use this for turkey bacon or regular bacon several times a week . 
after testing it out for a couple of days ,  i actually love using it . 
we originally got the first one like this from walmart years ago and they no longer carry them . 
the price was reasonable ,  and i m very pleased with the instructions . 
second benefit is that you can upgrade the headphones if you want  bose ,  dr dre ,  etc  . 
i purchased this item over num_num years ago ,  and it is still great . 
nordic ware toaster oven num_num piece baking set works great with my old toaster oven . 
my arthritis prevents me from scrubing the vegetable very hard ,  then i ran across this little scrubber from amazon . 
the difference is in the other ingredients and flavorings in the keurig coffee pods . 
nice cover but not very attractive on the counter . 
the reasons are probably petty sounding ,  but here goes : it holds too much moisture; therefore it s not well vented . 
this is the second one that i have purchased . 
i tried some cucumbers and they sliced up so nice and thin . 
you don t really get a price break purchasing a set anyway . 
just don t get your finger in the way . 
i do a lot of baking and this size spatula is just perfect for icing cakes . 
it saves time ,  is cheaper than less effective sprays ,  and is convenient . 
having the markings where you are looking down on them was something i with i had thought up . 
perfect support to keep my head lined up with the rest of my spine . 
this protected my iphone from countless falls ,  sand at the beach ,  splashes of water while washing dishes ,  etc . 
this review was written by my wife ,  who does most of the cooking around here . 
this is the second blackberry phone owned and my husband uses it for business . 
my old belt broke so i needed a new one . 
what drew me to braun three years ago was its simplicity . 
it takes up very little space on a desk or dresser . 
best case they ever used ,  very happy with it !  can t go wrong with an otterbox product !  . 
unless you re looking for a professional grade grinder ,  this one serves its purpose exceedingly well . 
i ve used olive oil ,  so far and it works great !  . 
the big one was too big ,  too heavy ,  too hard to store . 
the cooker is easy to use and easy to clean . 
to update it i can say that these knives have performed extremely well . 
battery life gives me num_num to num_num hours of mixed use . 
but it isn t perfect and hence receives a num_num star rating . 
sorry i didn t get one for myself at that low price !  . 
my house is warmed by radiators and it is the driest heat possible . 
the braun kettle is by far superior to the one i had been using . 
kitchenaid is still a great name ,  and can last for many years . 
my sister bought this for me because i love cooking . 
when i bought a few of these ,  i did not have num_extend
my recommendation though ,  is to get the larger antenna . 
it doesn t work as well on an ipad but i m not sure that s what this is for . 
disclaimer :  using any popper for roasting voids the warranty ,  requires careful monitoring ,  and should be done outside . 
provides decent protection but if you drop your phone a lot go with the stronger model . 
it is made in china from german steel and the handle feels to be some sort of metal also . 
i received this for christmas from my daughter . 
and anyway ,  put  me in a mason jar and let the concern go out the num_extend
i wish it was stock android but we could always change that later on .  .  .  .  .  . lol .  .  .  . there you have it . 
i bought this over a year ago ,  and she still has it on her phone . 
that is not a con of the stylus however . 
the battery cover provided with the battery is actually very nice . 
i will continue loving it for a long time . 
i bought these because ,  well ,  obviously i needed a new set of knives . 
i began using bluetooth headsets when they first came out . 
sometimes it fits well and other times a top piece keeps popping off . 
 note :  it s now num_num and it s still working . 
i never use metal utensils in any pans ,  only wood or the nylon type implements . 
after calling oxo customer service ,  a replacement lid was sent that very day ,  at no charge ,  with apologies . 
if i put this in my pocket or on my phone it d easily fall off . 
it s easy to use and clean and pours very nicely . 
you can holster the phone so that screen is toward your body ,  providing even more protection . 
i do forget to connect once in a num_extend
we recycle everything we can and like the fact that we don t have to throw away paper filters . 
we use both of them every single day so that we have a constant supply of perfectly cooked grains . 
this really should be offered at a lower price . 
these are perfect to use for jars that are not are to be processed . 
victorinox makes one that is much lighter if weight is an issue . 
these filters fit perfectly and will last me almost a years . 
i love anything by cuisinart ,  and these utensils are no exception . 
there are various size pieces and directions are included on how to swap them . 
the vinegar is a weak disinfectant but does remove the scale . 
i have discovered that since it is on the counter all the time now ,  i use it for everything . 
it was big enough to hold onto the outside ring and still grasp both pot handles . 
seems to be about the same quality as ones i ve seen for twenty bucks each . 
the braun aromaster kf num_num is a well built coffee maker that makes good coffee . 
it is beyond wonderful !  i tried a large frozen pizza today and it worked to perfection . 
we really appreciate that the attachments fit all models of ka mixers . 
i just carry this charger around in my bag for emergencies . 
i love this press !  i don t understand why some people are having trouble with it . 
i ve seen reports of some of the compounds in plastics showing up in tumors found by doctors . 
i like the stand a lot ,  but i wish it stood firmer . 
the product is as described and fit great . 
can t beat the price and more features than i anticipated . 
at num_num feet ,  the connection seems to be spotty . 
now ,  if only i can peel hb eggs without tearing up the white part . 
you simply can t ask for a better headset . 
i placed on the desk ,  turned on high and it did not fall over . 
after most of the alloted time is up ,  remove the covers on the machine and take a look . 
i bought this product to make poached eggs . 
i wish the mechanism would hinge up  as a stand mixer might  . 
i will post an update in a month or two . 
if i had realized this before ,  i would have paid the extra money to get the stainless steel one . 
i made an eggless no cook ice cream for my first try . 
this skin fits perfectly and does not fall off or move arround like other skins . 
the battery life ,  on the other hand ,  is great . 
i like this screen savers and will definitely purchase this product again even for someone else . 
these sheet protectors worked well on my daughter s iphone . 
needed a replacement decanter for the coffee maker at work . 
once you get the knack of it you can easily and quickly slice your bread . 
i could only use the jumbo on my kitchen island . 
i steam and boil large amounts of veggis and keep them in the fridg . 
i got these to go with a new shower curtain and liner when i was redecorating my guest bathroom . 
if you have any doubt ,  you are better off just returning the case . 
just scored one of these oxo ice cream scoop on a manager s special at fry s food in scottsdale az . 
more time is probably too much unless you really like dark stuff . 
i have lived here num_num years ,  carpet never looked this good . 
i ve lost the cover once ,  and found it nearby on numerous occasions . 
this is the first carpet cleaner i have ever owned and i am sorta happy with it . 
it is rather noisy however ,  but that is the only negative . 
this pan is so fun and easy to cook my aebleskiver pancakes . 
anything you need to stay warm this is what you want . 
when i first bought this i wasn t super impressed . 
in fact came back and bought another one to have a spare as they are hard to find !  . 
recommend using the steamboard with it so you don t burn your hands . 
it also shuts down if you leave and it senses the phone is gone for ten minutes . 
it is dwarfed in size compared to most other food processors ,  like my mother s . 
eighteen months after purchasing the braun ,  i can say that it has lived up to its high reputation . 
i was getting this as a gift for a friend because i already have one . 
i do very little cooking and even less  i . e . 
one cautionary note :  i wouldn t move the rack when it was full or even just partially full ,  either . 
it actually looks much better than other shoe racks . 
i got several holders on amazon for very little $ and free shipping to boot . 
i lightly sprayed these pans even though it is non stick . 
very sturdy ,  light weight and fits in the palm of your hand . 
i am a big tea drinker and this is the perfect pot for me . 
we also use this between dry cleaning runs to freshen clothing and save some money . 
both this spatula and thetovolo silicone spatulareceived  highly recommended  ratings in num_extend
the bacon comes out crispy and fully cooked . 
i ordered this after having had a horrible experience with griffin s itrip . 
i don t even have it installed on my computer come to think of it . 
they hold a charge for months it seems ,  i keep them as back ups . 
i just quit with the squirt of oil ,  and it just stays clean enough . 
all tools i have handle well ,  and actually make me feel a pro chef !  . 
this is the perfect vacuum for lightweight work . 
it does what i bought it to do . 
picked this one up in a thrift shop and it appeared brand new . 
we only buy fiestaware now !  it is so durable . 
after reading many reviews i selected this tea maker and have enjoyed that decision ever since . 
complete mobile ,  with dock and wall charger ,  you can use one at home and one at work . 
of course ,  that s my fault for not checking ,  i suppose . 
it is absolutely fantastic and i highly recommend it . 
the other purchase i made was an additional carafe that has been so helpful with company . 
i am back for another ,  maybe a little smaller . 
great for using you phone like a gps . 
so ,  a better fitting lid would be a huge improvement !  . 
i think it s great to have spare holsters and covers . 
it can be used both on the stove as well as in the oven . 
filters are relatively cheap ,  arrive quickly with amazon prime ,  and are easy to replace . 
the jabra easygo bluetooth headset is attractive looking ,  lightweight at num_extend ounces and fits comfortably on your ear . 
limes are notoriously uncooperative in giving up their juice ,  but this design gets the juice . 
i love the discreetness of the headphone ,  people can t even tell you have headphones on . 
i like the reusable filter with the brew n  go . 
i would and have recommended to my friends . 
looked good but the red part seemed cheaply made . 
i don t use any spray and only oiled it as per the instructions the first time i used it . 
stuff stuck in the blades sometimes but was not a problem . 
i ve had mine for several years ,  but only really started using it recently . 
still ,  i am giving it num_num stars ,  because when it works it works very well . 
i like that it s easy to put on the phone with minimal bubbles to smooth out . 
with two or three uses per week by adults only ,  they should not have broken in about a year . 
excellent processor and the different size bowls are great for smaller portions . 
just ordered my second  my first didn t go out i just wanted to have two !   . 
it was easy to use ,  but make sure you use plenty of flour between rolling . 
i ve had these for a few months now and so far am not disappointed . 
one of the teaspoons did end up with a  rust  spot due to overcrowding the utensil container . 
the front and back protectors went on smooth and easily and were a perfect fit . 
that said it is easily the best flask i have ever had . 
two hours later it was good to go . 
initially ,  i was a bit concerned with how well i would be able to clean it . 
easy to clean and doesnt fall apart when washed vigorously . 
this is very lightwieght and keeps the phones slim profile while providing a little protection . 
the biggest difference is that the mount for my htc thunderbolt is not as sturdy as the dx mount . 
there is no whistle or spout cover but for me that is a bonus . 
they re also washing machine safe  just wash with like colors on a delicate setting  . 
this is well worth the different in price from the non pro version . 
but the pros of this product ,  along with the great price ,  make this a purchase that i d make again . 
i can t understand what would make some peoples waffles stick . 
i have it sitting next to my kitchen sink . 
just make sure you buy the right one . 
she used it to make large batch of sauteed clams in wine sauce which came out killer !  . 
it fits num_num shoes and is the bottom of the rack is about num_extend feet from the floor . 
buy them now !  i was really surprised to see  germany  stamped on these fine blades . 
if so ,  then i would know there was no change . 
i am very happy with this cookie sheet . 
i really love these pitchers and i almost didn t buy them based on some other reviews . 
it is not as buggy as the nokia num_extend
first ,  i placed hanging hooks evenly around it . 
it behaves like it is an entirely different internet browser . 
i think i read somewhere this is best used for android phones . 
since we stopped eating process food we cook at home . 
it works well and easy to keep clean . chef , john murgo cooking and cursing video s  . 
i d much prefer one that sticks out a little ,  and had half the resistance . 
the knives are balanced and have a great weight and feel in your hands . 
it also does not say that it s void after a certain number of uses . 
i bent the light metal frame trying to set it up . 
if you plan to drop it or throw at some point  don t know why  it will open . 
this is an improvement over the traditional french press coffee makers . 
i use it with two samsung epic num_extend mine and my gf easy to pair . 
be aware though that this case adds substantial bulk to the iphone num_extend
now ,  i just wish they make a leather case for this thing . 
you have to pay attention to what you re doing . 
so far i don t see any challenges with ours . 
it will be great to take camping too . 
from all the previous reviews ,  i wondered if this was a good product from kitchenaid . 
compared to henkles and wustoff .  .  .  .  . wow !  that wow is dependent on who you are . 
plus ,  you can easily put it away when not in use ,  thus freeing up counter space . 
low tide for this model as of may num_num is about $
i think it is a motorola ,  but i like this one best . 
they almost feel like plastic dishes and i had alays thought corelle felt almost like china . 
i love the can they come in it keeps them nice and neat . 
i got this as a gift for my niece and she loved it . 
fits nicely in my hand and peels great . 
much more precise than other and quite sensitive . 
the quality seems to be good ,  only time will tell about this . 
very clear transmission of calls both incoming and outgoing . 
works great as a second vac and use it on my tile floors and bathroom hair . 
i have htc evo n fits like a glove . 
though they re stoneware ,  the glossy black finish is gorgeous and makes any old coffee look like a treat . 
this newer model also has a snap out lid liner for easy rinsing . 
a must have with our toaster oven !  easy to use . 
when i get out and the phone rings the caller id comes up over the headset . 
it has dutifully protected the phone without a scratch . 
i am an alltel user and many of my phones have had this feature . 
anyways ,  product works great and looks cool on my captivate . 
charges my samsung galaxy num_extend at the correct voltage . 
we add mashed banana ,  applesauce ,  almonds ,  peanut butter chips and chocolate chips so far  not all together ,  lol  . 
it has an opening at the top  for overflow  which is a good thing . 
i got these for the table and am very pleased with them . 
i shouldn t have to remove the skin to charge my blackberry . 
thus far i have used it for num_num hours . 
same as everyone else here ,  the shaft eventually fails and will no longer turn the handle . 
the piece is well made and will be long lasting . 
i ve read a lot of reviews regarding the product before buying . 
all brita lids seem to be a problem . 
plug it in ,  load some cream ,  flavorings and fruit ,  and let it rip . 
i can t compare the touchscreen to apple because i have never owned an apple product . 
as in my title of the review this shield is not friendly for the otterbox defender series . 
so i put the first one on backwards with the sticky side facing the wrong way . 
they should add this to the packaging information . i ve juiced well over num_num limes since receiving the press . 
the cover is like the same quality when i purchased the blender . 
i love it !  i always have a full charge battery . 
i like to keep extras ,  my kids lose these things all of the time . 
it is great ,  my son loves it and we will order again .  .  .  . please take this review this time . 
if you are going to buy one this is the one you need to buy . 
if you take your time and really clean the screen and apply them carefully they will work . 
this is the perfect size scoop for the little meatballs i make for italian wedding soup . 
all you do is rinse it out when you are done with the use of it . 
the cones are quick change ,  and quick wash . 
just put it in then out it come . 
this cleans out a mixing bowl like no one s business . 
this is a replacement for the original part . 
i have reciened my order for the order and i am very pleaced with the timely processing and shipment . 
at beginning i bought only a pair because i was worrying about the quality . 
it seems like its a bit larger than a quart and i am sure my family will enjoy it . 
i must like them because i keep buying more . 
i would like the volume to be a little louder . 
it seems regular fitted sheets are too long . 
i have always wanted a kitchenaid blender and am so glad that i finally splurged and got one . 
corningware is the gold standard for bakeware in my opinion . 
i havent used it for other things yet . 
it is so lightweight in my ear that i can barely feel it there . 
update : one  of the num_extend bottom elements in this oven died after num_num years . 
the only bad thing was i thought it was black . 
however ,  that s why i have a dish washer . 
great product ,  this is the second product i have bought from skinomi . 
dslr dashboard didn t work that great ,  but enough to shoot video . 
my guess is that people that have had reliability problems are klutzy or not careful with it . 
well this idea put me off from canning for many many years . 
my daughter stole the red one and is holding it ransom for a whole set of her own . 
this was substantially less expensive ,  so i decided to give it a try . what do you know ?  it really works . 
i will be purchasing more in the future . 
for a normal butter cream or cream cheese frosting should work fine . 
i have this pan for over a year now . 
the recipes that come with the machine are perfect for it ,  always as hoped . 
i think it takes about about num_num seconds with a half hopper of beans for a drip filter grind . 
i m thinking of buying a num_extend one for when i wear this one out . 
i have no complaints with this protective case and i highly recommend it for your iphone . 
the extra sizes come in handy ,  and the ring has made a great way to hang them for storage . 
the kids like it because reaches to where they need better than the original . 
it will last a life time unlike the plastic ones i kept buying . 
it cleans very easily; just handwash or place in dishwasher  top rack  . 
they worked great and i m sure they can accommodate any cupcake or cookie size . 
only used once so far ,  but the results were spectacular . 
not a huge deal but not what the pictures would lead you to expect . 
doesn t feel as solid as most other oxo products . 
the stock music app is ok ,  but there are many alternatives available for free from android market . 
and the seller of the wok ,  the wok shop ,  is also great . 
strong ,  sturdy and they seem to be a quality product that should last a long time . 
they work fine but might be small for cereal boxes . 
i ve never been anything but very happy with them . 
everything else went quickly ,  including sport knives . serrated knives that are serrated on one side were sharpened excellently . 
it has not lost suction plus still looks new even though its been in use num_num months . 
i wasn t impressed with it s build quality either though . 
piping hot liquid would probably go to num_num hours or more . i just tried the oxo liquiseal and was disappointed . 
i researched and thought a lot before getting these headphones . 
no end falling off in heavy work and getting gross after alot of use . 
they work really well ,  and they are heavy duty enough to handle the weight of large cake pops . 
younger people would appreciate the retro design and cool factor .  .  . to a point . 
if you have kids you know that they are not usually so amazing at getting things put away . 
as several other reviewers have said ,  this grinder is a very good deal for its price point . 
negativeshow to tell if it s on or off ?  there no indicator . 
i don t know why i waited this long to buy this . 
 she drags me around at over num_num mph !   the jaybird was perfect . 
it s the shine that makes the effort worthwhiledownsides :  brushes are awkward to use and get bent after one use . 
i could not believe how fast it brewed and the coffee is hot . 
it is easy to handle and manipulate . very responsible seller . 
the more you use it ,  the better your slices look . 
she thought they were not around anymore until i showed her that she can get them on here . 
it had a very short warranty ,  unlike the vornado five year warranty . 
i clip it to the brake cables with the small caribiner that came with the tether . 
an obnoxious buzzer sounds when eggs are done . 
i have not had any uneven cooked foods as someone mentioned in a previous review . 
if the popcorn is in too deep of a bowl ,  it doesn t crisp up as much as it cools . 
we use the juice to cook sauces as well . 
this handy little gadget could certainly have saved a bunch of flour over my years of baking . 
not many cases have that option but i think it protects the face of the phone better with it . 
once you get it ,  its as easy as num_extend
bought this to use outside in a garden terrace . 
far exceeded expectations ,  pictures do not do it justice . 
you get boiling water in last than a minute . 
the construction is first class and is useable on an induction cook top . 
the magnum has a tray that catches pepper dust and the magnum plus does not . 
we will order more  different colors  in the future . 
by doing this the juices don t get drained out when vacuuming . 
love love that this product is made in the usa . 
and in that respect ,  this does fit the bill . 
my previous car charger could not provide enough power to keep the battery from draining when using navigation . 
there are detailed instructions available on the internet . 
if the prongs are rotated num_num degrees ,  they cannot fold away . 
i cut the apples into quarters and threw them in a pot with whole cranberries . 
amazingly ,  it didn t die immediately ,  but it was never the same after that ,  and eventually quit working . 
it serves the purpose and i felt it was a bargain for the price . 
they work good just like the other one i had . 
force dim the display all the way down and turn it off once you finish . 
the feeder chute is large enough for a whole apple or orange . 
i got the blackberry in excellent condition and it is brand new . 
it works great and was a reasonable price . 
the handle has somewhat of a seamless connection to rest of the whisk ,  so food does not get stuck . 
i m so happy with it ,  i bought a second . 
this thing is practically a member of our family . 
the torx screwdrivers are magnetized ,  which makes the removal and replacement of small screws much easier . 
the headphone jack has to lead to the right in order to read the display properly . 
in another num_num seconds i had the mandoline disassembled ,  rinsed ,  and in the dish rack . 
i did not want an aluminum pot though ,  so fragile carafe it is . 
it may not be the justin bieber chrome car ,  but it is an easy second for a man . 
i have used this set not just for storage ,  but for prep work . 
without using the gelatine as a stabilizer ,  it will turn num_extend
so she took it and applied it again . 
if you have strict tastes ,  then you won t be buying this anyway . 
it s nice that the pump top collapses down for storage and the brake button is nice too . 
i feel like my phone is well protected . 
i measured it and it will hold exactly num_num tbs . 
it replaced a rubbermaid spoon that was discontinued . 
i have no qualms in recommending the capresso burr grinder . 
i can now just sit my phone in this little pod . 
plus it s very heavy with the metal lid on . 
this iron has three features that make it great : first ,  its cordless . 
the color i to die for it was the perfect green to match my shoes purse and outfit . 
now the cakes and sponges will be the right thickness . 
oh and make sure you rinse the waste receptacle out after cleaning so it doesn t get gunked up . 
once i got the hang of it ,  i never stopped and fell in love with this particular can opener . 
for me the big selling point on the oxo good grips is the width of the handle . 
they are almost % taller than other filters . 
i have used this set of cookware since july num_extend
next time ,  we let the grill heat up for a full num_num minutes before putting the meat on . 
most of those junk simply cover up the dirt and eventually you re back to where you started . 
this product performs as well as the very expensive silpat mats and is far less expensive . 
now she can uses her phone all day and is a happy grandma !  thumbs up all around !  !  . 
i can her the other person and they can her me . 
this one delivers that ,  with very clear sound on both ends . 
its wood has a nice heaviness and look and the whole board is smooth . 
plus they have everything going for them :  price ,  perfect design and safety . 
if your looking for a grill for the inside this is the one . 
i love this pepper mill !  it is the only mill that i found that really works ,  and works well . 
some fitted cotton clothes looks pressed after use . it s easy to use ,  refill ,  and store . 
you don t have to scroll through an entire timer cycle to get to the exact time you want . 
pour this starter mix into the remaining milk and num_extend
the only thing i would change is adding a stay put material to keep it from sliding . 
took way too long so i figured i d get the delonghi espresso maker . 
i use these spatulas heavily ,  more than i use any other . 
you wouldn t notice it from other rooms . this model has a nice squarish figure . 
maybe it is just my history ,  but i am still just waiting for it to break . 
personally i like a sharp knife but would rather be using it rather than spending time sharpening it . 
i have even taken it to the beach and kept my phone safely tucked away elsewhere . 
cuisinart are known for having the best food processors and this one is no exception . 
now ,  it seems to only be available from the marketplace for considerably more . 
i wear glasses so it s important to have something that fits right . 
but i can not figure out how to get the u pholstery hose and attachments to work . 
i ordered these to avoid the dangers of reheating food in plastic container . 
the case was a bit bulky but worked very well . 
i have them in all colors ,  and they are easy to use and easy to clean ,  very durable !  !  . 
it was very difficult to remove ,  and affected the burnished finish . 
every time i would open the lid ,  the grounds would stick to it or spray everywhere . 
growing up in the num_extend my cassettes were my life !  it hasn t failed yet to fool anyone . 
i also like the fact that you get three different cake patterns using this one pan . 
i use it to make everything from pancake batter to cookies and for ice cream preparation . 
the more batches cooked ,  the more difficult cleaning becomes because the food becomes stuck to the tray . 
we returned the num_num and got the num_extend
as a prime member ,  i got it in one day . it s so incredibly simple to use . 
it s really sleek looking too and easy to clean !  . 
i previously had this protector on my iphone num_extend and it lasted for num_num years ,  no scratches or anything . 
amazon shipping was fast and oxo quality is great ,  plus the cup can be measured looking down the top . 
it always connects right away and the battery life is great . 
ive always wanted some of these but usually they are small . 
very comfortable head phone and sound quality is okay . 
we will likely cease using the high end pan ,  go back to the regular ones and enjoy this mat . 
this dock saved countless hours .  .  . it never stopped working ,  always charged the phone quickly ,  and never moved from it s location . 
this rack is stylish and just the right size for in sink use or on a counter . 
they stack great and do the job perfectly . 
not just louder ,  but clearer  in a way . 
keeps our boos board well i oiled and i great shape . 
believe me when i say i would have returned it with the quickness if the bass wasn t good . 
i was a little worried about bulk ,  but its not so bad at all . 
just make sure you tip it a couple of times while straining and it will come out . 
sleek and stylish looking on the counter next to stainless steel or black appliances . 
i wanted a headset both to pair with my phones and my computer for voip use . 
it fits ok but it a little bid tighter ,  and is difficult to remove for the washing purpose . 
this rack is well made ,  durable and sturdy . 
i ordered two of these to go on my new phone . 
it can show scratches sometimes ,  but i really think that s true of any dishware . 
these cooling racks are very handy . they stack great so you save space ,  and are easy to clean . 
i felt it was way to much time spent cleaning around these cords . 
i would definitely buy it again from amazon . 
i ve ran this type of humidifier for num_num years now in colorado . 
love it so much ,  just ordered num_num more for my i touch s . 
the size is perfect for measuring and mixing items for easy mixing into other ingredients . 
it fits in my pocket easily and that s where i normally carry it . 
the wonderful larger size is no longer available anywhere that i could find in this design . 
i just have to add that the knife block looks much nicer in real life than in the photo . 
i usually don t buy kits ,  as you re paying extra for things you don t always use . 
i purchased this when my pampered chef can opener began to wear out . 
also vacuum sealed some toiletries to prevent leakage . 
they re easy to clean ,  by hand or dishwasher . 
i bought this to replace a car charger that needed a separate cord attached to the base . 
come on !  for $ you can t go wrong . 
because it is shallow i would not recommend it for soup . 
i will be ordering the salad plates as well . 
i use it for straining milk kefir grains from the finished product or getting strawberry seeds out of sauces . 
the non stick cups keep some of the egg on them when you try to scoop them out . 
we replaced it with the george foreman grilleration model . 
less coffee ,  fewer trips to the bathroom ,  fewer jitters . 
you should try both and choose the one that is most comfortable for num_extend
other than that it is perfect and i m going to buy one today for my wife . 
it gets the job done and i use it all the time with no problems . 
i sent them the info and they quickly sent me a new otterbox ,  no questions asked . 
a really nice ,  functional accent for a kitchen . 
the silicone case holds the battery in place and protects the phone as well . 
these are tools and they work for what you need tools for . 
i was pleasantly surprised with my first attempt . 
i like my waffles a little crisp so i let mine cook an extra num_num seconds . 
when the fan is on medium or high ,  this is a noisy machine . 
i use it for large salads or veggies when i have have company . 
after searching for an electric juicer that could handle our homegrown pomegranates ,  i settled on this hand juicer . 
i was deeply troubled after reading all these negative reviews . 
the probe is skinny and easy to insert without making a giant hole and the readout it pretty quick . 
over all most of the ram issues and android and motorola bloat wear . 
i love the shiny ,  black color as it matches my appliances . 
i am overall very pleased with this item . 
fried foods taste better and are not as greasy as they were in my old deep fryer . 
for such a cheap price ,  the cable is surprisingly a good value . 
this cost me $ including shipping and included the steamer part which my wife loves . 
simple to use and easy to care for . 
no need to fool with a juicer or squeeze by hand through a strainer . 
i love this thing !  the steaks came out so evenly brown and juicy on the inside . 
i use the timer when i am proofing bread dough  again great not to miss the num_extend
also ,  i am missing that whole retractable cord thing ,  but i still find this iron is worth it . 
i ll have to see what else it cooks well . 
it really has good suction ,  which is a big plus . 
this item came when it was supposed to . 
i especially like that the corners have extra padding on them . 
i found it much more comfortable to wear and easier to use . 
this is the best bluetooth headset i have ever owned . 
i purchased this headset to replace a jabra headset suddenly that died . 
i placed the lodge cast iron pizza pan on top of the grates and closed the cover . 
the charger casing had a few blemishes ,  so it could either be used ,  refurbished or display stock . 
i bought a service for num_extend num_num years ago . 
carpets dried over night and dirt stains from my puppy all came out . 
i ve owned num_num for different phones in the last num_num years . 
i can wrap it around my hair and not have a head or neck ache afterwards . 
i would recommend this for anyone who uses a mixer a lot . 
this is the best tea maker i have used . 
really an excellent addition to any canner s tool library . 
if you want a case to really protect your iphone or other device . 
the recommended speed for cans is number two and it turns ,  opens and peels off without any barbs . 
it s a joy to be able to have fresh juice easily . 
i have this stock pot and i love it . 
just center the screw on top ,  hold the bottle and opener tight with one hand and turn the handle . 
i had been looking for more items to go with my callaway dishes set . 
he used it for his exercise and running program . 
i ve been using the pan almost daily for two months and have no complaints . 
the zippers are strong and the vinyl is think ,  high quality . 
and i rather like the fact that i paid two third s less than the other machine . 
i used these in an old storage set that i had . 
prefer this time of case over the otterbox ,  which is too clunky for me . 
this isn t a problem with this device ,  but rather a consideration when pairing multiple bluetooth devices to a phone . 
translates num_num text acronyms . results : while i had no problem with the samsung ,  i did have problems with the lg . 
i would recommend this to anyone who has a smartphone and wants the maximum protection . 
i popped in num_num cloves ,  rolled it on the counter as instructed ,  and one popped out peeled . 
the feed chute is a pain to clean but cuisinart was trying for max flexibility . 
you see it and you now know that it s an evolutionary step up on the ladder . 
an oval crock pot allows you to fit larger cuts of meat in the crock than a round pot . 
not new ,  uma has been available in the us since num_extend
i love it ,  color looks great just like advertised . 
they are very easy to apply and last a very long time !  . 
i used superglue and prolonged the life of mine for a while ,  but it was annoying . 
why do i buy them ?  because my wife and i keep on breaking them because of butterfingers . 
i bought this for my daughters num_extend and it seems to work good ,  her num_extend player isn t broke . 
but ,  watch what you are purchasing ,  there are num_num separate types of lids on the duromatic pressure cooker . 
i ve been using this for over a year and it works great . 
my machine arrived at num_extend on may num_extend
it is relatively quiet ,  really collects dust and air particles ,  and has been humming now for almost num_num months . 
i stream music with an num_extend profile through my ipod or pc while also using my mobile phone . 
it s a great size for stir fries ,  browning meats ,  tossing pastas with sauces ,  etc . 
i have dropped the phone already and not a scratch on the phone . 
if i had to choose only one bowl to keep ,  it would be this one . 
to solve this problem ,  just use regular coffee filters . 
light and easy to move ,  can brown anything on the stove and then put it right on the warmer . 
this is a very nice knife block ,  and a great value . 
glad i didn t find something else in the stores before i saw these . 
i just inherited this num_num bowl set from my num_num year old mother . 
it s on par ,  or maybe slightly better ,  than the standard earphones that come with ipod and iphone . 
they sound great for inexpensive earbuds and fit well . 
setup was extremely fast and easy and i was up and running in under num_num minutes . 
it held up perfectly for the couple of weeks that i used it . 
when it is introduced to the lower portion ,  it blends fantastically . 
good fit and good use with my new bunn coffeemaker . 
the knife cuts much more smoothly ,  and the sharpener eliminated any  dead spots  in the cutting edge . 
still seems like it is working pretty well . 
i was a bit afraid it wouldn t fit in the oven ,  but it does . 
when i received it ,  the tray was broken and it was so cheaply made . 
i would recommend this unless you are looking for a wider spatula ,  say to turn large pancakes or omelets . 
i would definitely use onesim again if i needed to . 
there is a breeze option that is more annoying than useful . 
this knife is a wonder for slicing and mincing veggies . 
however ,  i had a friend playing with his evo and asked to play a little . 
i literally send text messages num_num times faster than i used to . 
no more need to roll dough balls in my hand . 
i can t imagine a kitchen without a ronco rotisserie . 
taken again .  .  . update :  i contacted amazon about the screen and without hesitation they sent me a replacement . 
i was reluctant to buy this one ,  because i wasn t wholly satisfied with the num_extend i had . 
which would suck because it does take a while ,  almost three hours so take this into account . 
so much better than dealing with canning lids . 
fits well ,  syncs up with phones very easily and has good range and sound quality . 
now i see it s got a   .  .  .   rebate !  oh ,  well . 
that s when i discovered that there had been a recall on the cover for the machine    .  .  .    . 
have not had any problems with the stand . 
i have also used it to make a mean chicken marsala ,  eggs ,  browned some ground beef ,  etc . 
the table is light oak and the holder matches it nicely . 
the front has a soft silicone bumper the whole way around the face . 
cleaning is a bit of a hassle to get under the blade etc but not impossible . 
i like it . do not not how long it will last before next battery replacement . 
purchased these for son and dil to replace their old ,  broken knives . 
i never write reviews about things that i buy on amazon . 
that is my only complaint about this gadget . 
near the end of popping ,  there is just too much popcorn and too little room for agitating . 
the bride is using it and claims to love it . 
my daughter and i purchased these for the kitchen . 
a little common sense can go a long way . 
it s also wide enough that it doesn t push back my cat s whiskers while she s eating . 
i am not sure why the handles break . 
they are good for steak cutting and other rigorous types of meats ,  etc . 
three years later we re still using it every week .  . sometimes more often . 
nice weight ,  nice grade of stainless ,  nicely clad ,  fast conducting bottom ,  good heat distribution . 
after buying numerous thermos s ,  we have finally found the right one that does the job well . 
i ordered this in june of num_num according to the page header of this product . 
this basic charger works to charge anything with micro or mini usb in your car . 
not as sturdy as the defender ,  but definitely more user friendly . 
the gems held on and where not coming off at all . 
these are great !  i would definately order tham again . 
these rings are the only ones that i didn t have problems with and end up returning . 
i would buy it again to replace it ,  but would love to see their next model . 
i love the dlo case ,  just not it s velcro . 
it s white plastic and the lid is removable . 
i ordered my second honeywell from beachcamera through amazon ,  but the one arrived is the num_num version . 
i was surprised how much space this held ,  even though the description clearly says it . 
high quality construction and commercial look to num_extend
the low wattage is the key to the praise ,  here . 
the anchor lids get all deformed in the microwave  even though they are supposedly microwavable  . 
i ve since gone through the breville ,  a capresso ,  and now a cuisinart . 
i added a tablespoon of oil and the popcorn came out crispy . 
fit perfectly and very easy to place on the phone . 
i originally ordered this item from amazon ,  and it arrived in a very timely manner . 
i found that this size is very good and it works well . 
just a guess .  .  . i don t leave home without mine though . 
it woks fine and the num_extend length is very convenient . 
easy to use ,  does a little bit of everything you need in the kitchen . 
it s definitely not the iphone killer ,  but more of a trendy substitute . 
i can hear it in the near by room to my kitchen with the tv running . 
this is a perfect battery ,  charges fast ,  just like the original maybe even better an at a great price . 
expect to use it as recommended every so often to give the knives an extra edge . 
this cover is a very quality cover and is available in a number of colors . 
i don t think it takes num_num bucks to ship something about num_num oz . 
i just leave it in the containers of cat ,  pancake and flour for quick scoops . 
it does a great job cracking smaller nuts . 
without this unit i end up rushing to the bathroom to do a major mouth cleaning every morning . 
you would think the website would be updated as well . 
i love my pyrex and use it all the time . 
if you let the ground coffee sit in the container for a few hours it loses the static charge . 
it was just what i had ordered ,  great price ,  perfect fit . 
of course ,  it has to be used properly . 
i bought two boxes and so far one lid has bit the dust . 
i was very pleased with the product ,  both aesthetically and functionally . 
needed a spare cable for my travel kit and this fits the bill nicely . 
it s a pretty dinnerware set ,  holding up well . 
no end grain screws that aren t using anchoring devices . 
there is no time or circumstance when this speaker let me down . i love this speaker . 
it is very important to note that the upgrade has an automatic shut off . 
has a nice protective border onto the front of the phone . 
have not tried them yet ,  but look and fit well . 
it is unblocked so you can take it overseas . 
we prefer the stainless exterior to the version with the stainless interior and aluminum exterior . 
it s about as easy as it gets to use and cleans easily . 
my next project with it is to make frozen yogurt . 
thank you so much amazon . com for the great price ,  good value and prompt delivery . 
certainly simple to clean up ! just a fantastic product all around . 
works great on my android phone so it s definitely not just for iphones . 
it is easy to apply and virtually invisible when in place . 
good for tomatoes ,  too ,  because it cuts through without crushing . 
i used a new age ambient work with a large dynamic and tonal range to test : deep roots hidden num_extend
it is a pretty pink and the pattern is super cute . 
this phone is so pretty i almost traded mine in even though mine is newer . 
flip the press over and the black plastic clears the holes . 
fitted phone perfectly dont waste $ on expensive ones . 
i ve had it for over a year and it still last . 
and i will say that i am considering cooking eggs in it more than previously . 
put in a cup of rice ,  vegetables ,  meats or seafood ,  seasonings ,  tofu . 
then i slowly press the filter all the way to the bottom . 
you may be able to compensate for this by mounting it up higher . 
we replaced a set we bought in mid num_extend for $
i was so pleased that i bought more glasses from this company . 
it is also quite compact and sleek but with a decent cord length . 
if you don t sock it all the way in ,  the set screw will not catch properly . 
she complained she didn t have one after her husband pitched the one she had when something got burned on . 
the bowl is good size ,  a smaller angled size would be nice too . 
this is the one to have hands down and its really a bargain . 
it finally konked out so bought this one . 
a must have . item was well packaged and arrived on time . 
but ,  it was too close to the wall for my liking . 
it cleans up easily ,  too ! this dutch over is such a nice size . 
so when the timer arrived i was pleasantly surprised with how well it worked . 
they are easy to install and fit perfectly on my phone . 
not sure how animated a review can be about an electric  cranberry  red can opener . 
i have tried several other screen protectors and this one is my choice . 
it works great and can charge your ipod when you need it . 
the oxo good grips stainless steel turner is an excellent buy . 
i will compare this bluetooth to the plantronics num_extend and num_extend it s better than the num_extend and num_extend range . 
this was one of num_num things my mom wanted for christmas . 
after my two bad choices ,  thankfully my wife chose this one . 
i m blown away by the great service policy !  . 
i still use the yogurt maker weekly and love it !  . 
i use the glass lid from a num_num in fry pan when i need one . 
of num_extend and it gets used for approximately num_num hour x twice a week on carpet . 
it spatters water through the vent ,  but a dish towel draped over the lid took care of that problem . 
for those of you looking for a deal ,  this is for real . 
it s over num_num square inches of iron ,  folks . 
it s a great oven that has lasted over num_num years . 
i put hot water in it the night before and it is still warm in the morning . 
the problem was that my little oven did not include high quality trays . 
can t think of a bad thing to say !  . 
the battery is great and lasts a very long time . 
the mount holds the phone securely because it s spring loaded . 
we had already thrown several others in the trash . 
works great on my phone and keeps it charged have had it several months still working just fine !  . 
i really like it and i think that it was a great purchase . 
these are by far the most comfortable ear phones i ve ever used ,  back beats included . 
this zester works really well; i m especially glad that i ordered the one with the handle . 
i do need a slightly larger pan now though to fit the  splat mat  properly though . 
i purchased this along with the powerpak twelve . 
these ceramic pie weights are wonderful for making nice ,  even crusts without shrinking or bubbling . 
i make a lot of thai ,  mexican ,  indian ,  mediterranean ,  and costa rican food ,  and all my own salad dressings . 
i also can push the inedible things  e . g . 
i keep one in my truck to plug into a usb charging adapter . 
connection quality is contingent with your cellular connection quality . 
i really like this product but so far i ve only used it once . 
this knife comes in a very sturdy case and the units functionality is fantastic . 
it works exactly as i had hoped it would . 
two months later it still smells like bamboo . 
the pan and the cover are of excellent quality . 
exceeded all expectations .  .  . and now i have a couple of spares . 
not to say it s bad in any way . 
no more paper coffee filters falling down while brewing making a mess and groungs in my coffee . 
not these !  a little short ,  could be num_num inches longer . 
it arrived in a timely manner with no problems on my end . 
i ve had the jabra wave for a little over a month now and so far i m very pleased . 
one word :  amazing !  came in normal otterbox packaging with everything you expect . 
you get a choice of thick or thin slices ,  depending on which attachment you use . 
quick shipment was provided by the vendor and item was exactly as described . 
i ve been looking for this kind that i could use in the oven . 
great little machine !  i ve used for a month and learned the trick to some great lattes . 
i never ,  ever use my drip coffee machine anymore . 
i find it s the first knife i reach for ,  for nearly every task . 
one email to capresso and they sent me a new lid for free . great unit ,  great support . 
it s not much ,  but it does make a difference when you compare the two . 
and the kickstand is great when you just don t feel like holding it any more . 
we have many of our most common spices organized in two of these racks . 
even a souffle will come out perfectly in this pot . 
keep track of your fridge and freezer temperatures during the course of the year . 
easy to clean and does quick work of chopping small amounts . 
i bought num_num of these as gifts and everyone likes them a lot . 
eta :  regarding the review above claiming a  horribly   flawed design  :  there is no design flaw ,  only an unrealistic expectation . 
i like them because i can hang things with these magnet that your typical magnet can t . 
i loved my first pair so much ,  i bought another for my mother . 
i guess the motor might seem loud to some people ,  but i don t notice it . 
from what i understand ,  the  old stock  units were not bpa free . 
it s best to get a grill pan ,  and electric fryer or wok for cooking with searingly high heat . 
makes a great cup to savor on a sunday morning . 
i use this to make quick breads and coffeecakes . 
this worked as the one that came with the phone worked so i think i came out ahead . 
as a microwaveable we rarely overheat them ,  because we don t want to overheat our food . 
this will do the the time being .  .  . sure makes a great pizza !  cover it well with cornmeal prior to use . 
hang this near your mess area and make clean up quick and life simple . 
this is the best mixer i ever had . 
this was a gift as the phone was a gift and they both work great together !  !  . 
it always helps to change things up every once in awhile . 
i make a lot of mistakes anyway but i type much faster on a computer . i can t stand the trackball . 
if you re careful ,  this thing will last you a looong time . 
it fits like a glove; and that ,  i believe ,  is what offers such serious protection from shock . 
it is much cleaner than the shelves we were using and it seems very sturdy . 
i can chop different ingredients and simply move them off to the side ,  board and all . 
i tried it on thanksgiving day with the copious turkey drippings that filled the cup . 
thanks ,  world kitchen ,  for not messing with success !  . 
the tool is included to remove the panel to wash or replace . 
i ve had this set of num_num mugs for num_num years and they are excellent and still have no defects . 
a lot of juicers are warming up the liquid produced which distroy the quality of the juice . 
i have had no problems with any of my kitchenaid products . 
there is no way to make less than a full pot though . 
this product makes zesting citrus and grating spices unbelievably easy . 
however ,  i don t think you can go wrong with this set . 
fits snug on galaxy num_extend even after months of use . 
brilliant ,  that s the only word you can use to describe this flawless scraper from kitchenaid . 
i had lots of questions and their customer service was more than helpful and respond quickly . 
it offers protection for the phone and complements it very well . 
space savers that actually keeps your pants in place . 
after the party i gave away num_num of the num_num sets and kept num_num for myself . 
one caveat .  .  . says in the instructions not to cook it on high but medium high at most . 
i have high hopes it will last as long as my last william bounds pepper mill . 
at first i thought the brand wouldn t matter ,  so i bought those $ walgreens chargers . 
because the device gets  seasoned  over time a bit like cast iron ,  you shouldn t put it into the dishwasher . 
real deal i use this stuff almost every week . 
i prefer them stacked in a drawer so i can simply reach in and grab the one i want . 
the size is versatile and the quality does not disappoint . 
it shaves ice just right for snow cones and for margaritas . 
i have uploaded a picture so you can see how it really looks . 
but it was the same thing all over again . 
while i was waiting for my maker ,  i used a a slow cooker . 
nice little feature . both the case and the holster leave leave all the ports open . 
i did not do anything for it to break . 
easy to assemble and sturdy ,  this is a useful wine rack . 
i still love it ,  but next time i would be a little more careful . 
this kyocera peeler makes me want to peel them now !  and . 
the seal may not be as tight as a foil seal ,  but should work fine for most use . 
i was a heavy data user on the evo . 
this one will probably do the same in a few years ,  but for the price ,  i ll get another replacement . 
i prefer stainless steel but haven t found one with the gripper bottom yet . 
the color is gorgeous ,  a bright coral perfect for summer and looks great against my white iphone . 
i doubt i would ever use it ,  but that is definitely the weakest part of this case . 
finaly got my own ,  cuts the job in half . 
this item really is built for a narrow door ,  which is fine for my purposes . 
i purchased this coffee maker in july of num_extend had a mr . 
don t close it or else it may rust with the water stuck inside . 
look better than burn marks or water marks and look more expensive than they are ,  . 
i really like this pitcher because you can seal it shut with ease . 
the grip is comfortable ,  and the blades are superb quality . 
it s a nifty little device !  the extra stoppers are prefect . once caveat :  these came sort of oddly packaged . 
the bacon is crisp and the majority of the fat is rendered out . 
i wanted a waffle iron that would make waffle making easy . 
can hang on my ice bucket or inside . 
these headphones replaced the motorola num_extend headset which was uncomfortable . 
it s small enough to put on a table or desk but strong enough to use on the floor too . 
it is easy to pair it to your phone . 
i purchased this one in hopes that some of the clutter could be reduced ,  and it worked . 
bought it for my wife who s getting into loose leaf tea . 
this glass is so strong that it survived the drop without so much as a crack . 
i have since purchased several packages and would highly recommend . 
i do make sure that i dont charge it until it gets down to num_num percent battery life though . 
i bought this so i could clean up my office area where most of my cleaning supplies live . 
put a potato half ,  cut side down ,  on top of each piece . 
it is my fourth machine over the last num_num years and works by far the best . 
i don t have to use it a lot ,  but it stays charged for a long period of time . 
i didn t feel that it formed to my ear very well at all ,  and eventually broke . 
it is a very comfortable knife with a nonslip handle . 
it cleans up with no effort and is dishwasher safe . 
one little spec of something ,  as with the like of others ,  youll have to use another one . 
it stands out and she knows it is her phone . 
i wasn t too disappointed ,  but needed a new phone . 
you would think that motorola would have thought of that . 
grinding meat that high is no big deal for me . 
these stainless steel cups are prettier than my plastic ones . 
an heirloom to pass down through your family . 
it works great !  easy to setup and use ,  not too heavy . 
so yeah ,  the iphone num_extend has a short battery when going on long flights and what not . 
this phone case has held up with time . 
for larger quantities ,  use the kitchenaid mixer attachments . 
i made this purchase based on several reviews . 
i have a num_extend num_extend and num_extend and i use them for everything . 
i am still getting them and would highly recommend the machine and also this size rolls . 
i find it very easy to draw num_num shot glasses of creme coffee . 
i bought this air purifier because my mom had the same brand an loved it . 
i was an owner of one of the first kitchenaid hand mixers that had num_num speeds . 
it fits well and i feel like my phone has some protection . 
have been using these glasses for about a month ,  and am enjoying them . 
like like the large handle and it is very well built . 
my granddaughter loves her new miss kitty iphone case . 
these are a lot more substantial than the cheaper set i previously owned . 
everything stands tall at the ready with room to spare . 
i accedentally put my left hand over the hole  i should xeal the hole first  . 
bought the steamer insert as well making this pan even more versatile . 
make sure you re holding it over the sink when you take it off . 
run  em through the dishwasher enough times and they ll start to warp . 
the disposable concentrator cups are relatively inexpensive on a per use basis . 
i purchased the white version ,  it so nice ,  light and easy to use . 
it originally sold for num_extend and the reconditioned ones are num_extend
i gave this to my dad ,  who is constantly on the phone when he s driving . 
it seems to be the perfect size ,  no matter what i m cooking . 
as long as it protects the phone ,  i ll replace a $ case . 
these glasses are the best price and very user friendly . 
i picked it because i could paint the wood to match my kitchen . 
you get six for about two bucks and you just can t beat that . 
i make another batch while straining the first batch . highly recommend . 
worked great on a recent trip to asia with no converters . i bought directly from amazon ,  which was cheap enough . 
the hangers keep nice dress pants easily accessible ,  and help keep clutter at bay in your closet . 
we decided to upgrade our plastic drip coffee maker for something better . 
they are made and operate well and look nice plus they are very stable and don t tip over . 
very smooth i would highly recommend this for anyone who has a ipod num_extend gen . 
seems to be the genuine motorola battery ,  and works just like a new battery should . 
as with all zwilling henckels knives ,  this is a great knife . 
very sturdy ,  i m sure it ll be in the family for years to come . 
it s a genuine replacement part at a good price . 
this is the only way to frost a cake . 
we have one at home and my husband wanted one for work . 
i am suing it as a sugar container for my sugar sticks . 
and since i m blind ,  then that statement makes perfect sense . 
as with all fiestaware it is great quality with lovely color . 
when i turned it over ,  i noticed that the other screw was also very loose . 
num_extend wipe it again with a lightly soapy sponge ,  or a damp towel . 
about two years ago i dropped our first one and broke the alarm . 
stores ,  they would be out or just not have them . 
i had the first one for years ,  until i dropped it and broke the blade part . 
just let them dry separately and then put them back together and it s fine . 
seems well made and less likely to cause an electrical fire than lesser products . 
i bought num_num more for my sisters ,  i love my new toy .  .  . oops tool ;   . 
now can easily charge the spare battery in the car or the road . 
the jar lid stays in place because of the negative vacuum pressure created inside the jar . 
so ,  from time to time ,  we have to replace things . 
all of these types of wilson products are worth every penny . 
if you want to make pasta all the time invest in a set . 
i think i love the balance most of all . 
this item is superior in feel and design to the one i had . 
it scrapes !  ! as an added bonus ,  it measures things shorter than num_num inches ,  too . 
used daily in our kitchen also ordered their paring knife and that s also good . 
the lids fit very tight ,  which is great when you re transporting soup as i often do in the winter . 
i ordered a replacement and within a week i was making my own ice cream at home . 
supposedly after you wash these you re supposed to rub a small drop of olive oil around the surface . 
not as heavy asthe defender ,  but i feel much better when i drop my phone . 
cut lemon in half ,  place in cup ,  squeeze ,  now that wasn t hard !  and it grabs most of the pits . 
bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it . 
the press consists of four metal pieces that easily break down for cleaning . 
that is the price you pay for no leaks ,  and i will take it . 
find it difficult to remove a single piece of apple pie or pizza pie .  .  . use this pie server . 
honestly ,  i have been looking for this little device ever since ford launched it s sync product for the mustangs . 
first ,  note that the color of the item is much richer looking than what is pictured . 
i got these cables as my old ones were worn out and starting to fail . 
the lid is wonderful because you can drink from any direction and it is very easy to clean . 
i work alone in a small school library . 
it s a lot easier said than done ,  i know ,  especially now with hboot num_extend but it can be done . 
amazon i m sure i ve done more than num_num reviews .  .  .  . what happens to them ?  . 
i highly recommend this product and would buy it again if i ever needed too . 
it has decreased my sandwich making time significantly . 
i have been with this razr for a few days ,  but it has been working great . 
be careful to order the correct size ,  the num_extend series has a num_num qt . 
we have had ours for about nine months now . 
it truly is smoke free and cooks up a steak just like the outdoor weber i had . 
i find that i saute food a lot ,   .  .  . veggies before they go into soup etc . 
and to get the right cooking time was always a guess . 
i wish this were bigger so that i could use it to make large quantities of greek yogurt . 
in my opinion ,  the green light indicating the phone has made good contact is good enough . 
you actually have some control over the degree the book leans back ,  and it s very sturdy . 
the pouch arrived when they said it would . 
i would recommend getting the circle filters like these instead of the square . 
if your original cord gets damaged this is a good alternative to buying the more expensive apple cables . 
this unit is designed with good accessibility so you can clean it very easily . 
fit my galaxy num_extend perfectly even with the case on it . 
so it was a no brainer and i bought the new press . 
it looks good ,  several times people have mistaken it for an iphone . 
the quality of the product was always determined by the environment and steady hand of the person applying it . 
that is when they must be disposed of . 
the plastic strainer on top did an excellent job of keeping out the muck as well . 
with surfaces such as teflon ,  this would release harmful chemicals . 
 :  anyway ,  i almost had a heart attack when i got the box via ups :  it s huge . 
but it didn t stay for more than a week . 
i may do that ,  one day ,  but this kit meets my immediate needs . 
it s not too heavy but it has a good weight . 
i suspect you have to read your microwave oven s instructions on proper use . 
the headsets are comfortable for my ears ,  yet a little large for my wife s ears . 
product seems of very well quality and he has had not problems . 
i sprayed the switch with electronics cleaner and it then worked reliably again . 
i have the num_extend knife as i have a small hand and this knife has become my daily knife . 
hasn t rusted like other cheap brands that i ve bought in the past ,  would buy again . 
i also tired a nokia ,  but the forked shaped earpiece did not feel secure . 
these brewing parts are a pain to clean . 
would definitely recommend this one !  happy shopper here . 
it gets many hours of use and delivers very clean sound . 
i have had this mixer for two years now . 
however it s a little expensive for what you get . 
as an alternative to spending hundreds on a commercial machine ,  this fits the bill . 
i loved this bluetooth ,  i still own it and would purchase it again with no problem . 
however it can sometimes be a little messy if i am using a small saucepan . 
he likes the way it stirs and for his purpose is happy with the popper . 
i like that the lid is solid iron and not glass and has two handles . 
it resumed the phone s power more than i used the samsung s headset . 
they re measuring cups what can you really say about them ? are they accurate ?  yes . 
i have not used these for phone calls so i cannot comment on call quality . 
they are wonderful ,  and everyone should have some . 
obviously ,  they are a bit big for that . 
perfection !  i will continue to order fiesta from amazon !  . 
 pressure + cooker with the addition of a trivet and foil sling ,  it works perfectly for rice cooking . 
i fill it each time i use it so it remains full . 
my wife insisted on getting a pressure cooker ,  i just didn t see a use for it . 
i put orange masking tape on it so i don t overlook it when i return my rental cars . 
be sure to buy labels for the bottles and the small funnel for pouring in your spices . 
i m glad i got it for her and i m glad she uses it !  . 
i knew kitchenaid has a good reputation . it arrived soon after i purchased it . 
the lid is a little tricky at first ,  but once you get the hang of it ,  it s dead simple . 
this num_num mm blade works great ,  but i noticed it really isn t much bigger than the num_num mm . 
next there is an included little wedge of plastic  a mini squeegee  to smooth out any bubbles . 
for the price and for the three pens . 
i love the ease with which this product works ,  it is invaluable in your kitchen . 
i was thrilled to find a wonderful cuisinart product which is compact and fits in a small space . 
i appreciate how light weight and unbreakable they are . 
the prongs are practically waiting for any vulnerable skin to come within reach . 
i ve had sony ,  motorola ,  nokia ,  plantronics ,  and jabra ,  just to name a few . 
you may need to tweak the timing since cooking times and crispiness vary depending on microwave ovens . 
refusing to even troubleshoot a product is called passing the buck . 
i just ordered two more sets and a single num_num oz canister for croutons . 
i m glad i ordered it !   .  .  . thank you d . d . 
works great and clean up was a breeze . 
it would not work with my phone in an otter box case as the charger plug was to short . 
my wife and i are both pleased with this product . 
it s nice to find something made in the usa and not filled with deadly toxins . 
this lead me to investigate as to why it might take so long . 
also ,  it starts off bread kneading really well . 
i had to scrub quite a bit to get the food off on my old plates . 
yes ,  my friends ,  i ve murdered plastic items many years along the way . 
again ,  as i have mentioned with my other emile henry dishes ,  the bottoms are unfinished . 
i like the strong plastic protector for the sharp pin . 
i no longer have this phone but wish i had another case like this . 
i ve been using this for a long time and it always work . 
i d recommend to anyone ,  and i d probably buy another set . 
it has a good clean feel when in your hands . 
my husband and i are vegan ,  so we were really excited about creating new vegan ice cream recipes . 
again ,  sync lights flash and the female voice confirmed  connected  when done . 
the flat belt like cable is weird but product works fine . 
i have thought about buying another pan to speed up the baking process . 
this double stainless steel rest does the job and looks bright and shiny on the stove top . 
this is my favorite grater ,  and i have probably around num_num  no kidding  . 
it smoothed out easily and once it set overnight it was great . 
these seals fit the bormioli rocco fido jars  or any other similar jar  perfectly . 
i plan to buy the salt grinder to match today . 
it has one speed ,  and a single three position switch :  on ,  off and pulse . 
i am not sure i will be using at all . overall ,  i like the speakerphone as it does a job . 
so far ,  she has had nothing but good things to say about this knife . 
if that is a concern you may want to seek out a true authorized reseller . 
i have been wanting this knife for quite a few years . 
the one thing i immediately notice is that the calpalon pan bottom is smooth and seamless . 
then it is put in the refrigerator which it is used to fill glasses or thermos as needed . 
not much else to say about them ,  but they are plenty long and they keep the clothes protected . 
still ,  it cleaned up easily ,  stores well ,  and will definitely be frequently used at my house . 
i have used plastic measuring cups the same style as this . 
now i use this handy timer and it makes my life simpler . 
i have been using mine for a few weeks ,  and here are my thoughts : pros : very ,  very durable . 
works just as good as a water filter ,  but the cost is substantially cheaper . 
i purchased the num_num piece chef s classic cook set and love it . 
i also grill peppers and onions on it for fajitas . 
the weighted base prevents it from falling over . 
in my opinion this is an exceptional product with a great price . 
i bought this for my phone and i m very pleased with my purchase . 
charged it num_num hours to full charge ,  num_num led lights showing . 
i love the holder and it is exactly as described . 
i ve done six loaves from six different recipes at this point ,  and each was perfection in a loaf . 
this battery is exactly as it says ,  it works perfectly and is from a reputable company . 
it sort of almost snaps on ,  but doesn t hold . 
i absolutely love these cuisinart pans  which i found in target  . 
my mom had a num_extend cast iron frying pan that she constantly used when i was growing up . 
and of course ,  there s all the wonderful colors . 
by the time morning comes ,  it s ready to hit the fridge . 
the sound is bright and clear .  .  . loud !  the bluetooth works with my headphones . 
it tops out at num_num so dont use it for candy that goes past num_num  to hard crack stage  . 
rubber grips make them super easy to use . 
use this to hold my iphone while walking my dogs . 
when we talk and she s using it i can t hear the road or car noise at all . 
i sipped on it all during class and work ,  and the temperature stayed perfect . 
i primarily use lorna sass  pc books and have yet to make a bad dish . 
we ordered this griddle on line and had it shipped to our son for christmas . 
i had to finally get the around ear option and still not perfectly comfortable . 
it arrived on time and i would recommend this seller . 
screen contrast and color isn t as nice ,  but text is a bit smoother . 
for our fast paced society num_num minutes can be an eternity for some people . 
it is a bit loud ,  but cleanup is so fast it s not on for long . 
at num_extend i had my first loaf ,  perfectly shaped and browned ,  wheat bread cooling on the rack . 
when i make lasagna or a fruit crisp ,  i use a glass or ceramic dish . 
you wont guess or fumble if you would like to raise the volume for instance . 
next time i will try it with one teaspoon . 
i wanted something to weigh product without a battery and this works well . 
i bought this zyliss comfort food chopper over num_num years ago and i m still using it . 
it was exactly what i wanted and i would and will purchase more cases from here . 
the glaze on the turquoise one was flawed so i m having amazon replace it . 
the scoop releases the food very easily ,  so using it cut my cooking time in half . 
this is the best case with holster ever !  it fits really well and easy to put on . 
the handle is comfortable to hold and heat resistant . 
i bought one of these used at a thrift store num_num years ago . 
just wait for them to come every couple months . 
it s long enough that our stretchy toddler could really stretch num_extend
i have used this tool for the following num_extend
i would think that they industry would have solved that issue by now . 
i plan on purchasing more of these for gifts in the future . 
i ordered this for my husband because he is always dropping his phone . 
quality of design and fit and finish is very satisfactory . 
went to buy another and the price had gone back up . 
i bought this battery as a replacement and it works just as good as the original ,  maybe even better . 
the buttons have gentle action yet offer a satisfying  click  feel when pushing them; not mushy feeling at all . 
both the old and new motors have the same power rating num_extend amps  . 
on the num_num inch orgreenic pan this seems to fit probably best of the aftermarket lids i have tried . 
if you love pizza then this is for you . 
this is the only microplaner i ve owned but it zests very well . 
it s a perfect fit ,  has deep rich color ,  and feels good in the hand without adding any bulk . 
if it can do my htc evo and iphone num_extend it should be able to handle just about anything . 
plenty of power to chop up my almonds into butter . 
this beats the slow cooker when you forget to prepare something at num_extend
slight amount of corrosion after a year but you have to look really close . 
wide range of attachments :  we also have the pasta extruder attachment . 
the reason i dinged it num_num star was simply that it does block the display just a tiny bit . 
also ,  i do not see how this is just a bacon rack . 
will the need diminish as all those backlog pieces are brought back to utility ,  yes ,  no argument . 
however we never use the grill side so i cannot comment on that . 
nordic ware has come up with a winner . 
make sure you are nowhere near any dust that can blow on it . 
would definitely recommend this unit to a friend . 
it works great to store all my small kitchen appliances ,  and boy do i have a lot of them . 
however ,  i had an amazon gift certificate and thought i d try one out . 
this little tool and holder is just what i needed . 
they do not include a spare stylus tip and that would have been great . 
does not mean it s not a good product ,  just have to be more careful !  arrived as scheduled . 
for the num_num or so contacts that i imported ,  it took maybe an hour to clean everything up . 
my old braun aroma deluxe coffeemaker died ,  probably from hard water deposits . 
they are great headphones and i highly recommend them . 
i bought this fan because my house is small and all one story . 
yes ,  i ve put these together before ,  but anyone should be able to figure it out quickly . 
nice and sturdy to hold my blackberry storm . 
the little slotted tray at the bottom keeps crumbs off the cookies . 
i suffer from parkinson s disease and am always looking for help in preparing my own meals . 
it has just the right amount of bling . 
this pot is good about easy clean and not heavy one . 
so far we ve had no need of that . 
all in all ,  i highly recommend this lunch jar . 
i bought a pair of these to use with my smoker and am very happy with them . 
our entire office makes smoothies every day for lunch during the summer . 
i don t like to be tied down to a charger so i bought this and a spare battery . 
it makes great coffee and is a breeze to use and clean . 
now i have only my stuff on the card so . 
i also ordered the purple gel skin and find these work very well for fast protection . 
as i came across this one i was shocked by the good deal . 
i don t use it for coffee as i have a burr grinder for that task . 
but the average gamer would like this compare to the others out there . 
i don t see where some were saying that it isn t stable . 
if it doesn t come off at that point use barkeeper s friend cleaner and a nylon scrubber on it . 
i ve always thought fat separators were a great idea and have owned several . 
when i was setting up my own house i found there were a myriad of choices . 
i use this is a lot of my baking and have had good results with it . 
perhaps this will not work as well as a larger burner for a wok full of food . 
i always found them to be a good product and did exactly what they advertised . 
your devices will thank num_extend included with the battery is a usb extension cable . 
these were much smaller then i thought they would be . 
i wanted a nice stovetop percolator that would work on an induction cooktop . 
the price was good and the pans are worth it . 
i ve had this grinder for over two years and use it mainly for french press . 
if you remove the nub ,  it works just fine . 
mounts that have suction cups are a joke ,  they don t stay put; this one does . 
heck ,  why would you use anything else ?  simple ,  affordable ,  and functional . 
during the entire process the chef s choice slicer was steady as a rock . 
on occasion ,  we will get a gift of a new coffeemaker and put the cuisinart away . 
i use this for my samsung galaxy num_extend
with all the fans i ve bought lately ,  i m becoming something of an authority on the subject . 
however ,  they match my set i have and do the job just fine . 
the era had nearly as good audio unless you were trying to listen to navigation audio . 
it is made exceptionally well and is a superb press for the money . 
this brand came highly recommended and the price here was better . 
can t think of anything more to add ,  now i have two complete sets . 
very heavy construction ,  nice clean rolled edges ,  sturdy and well made . 
the case is a perfect fit and super easy to install . 
thus i hope the dials will outlast the heater . 
bought it for my rooted nexus num_num for movie streaming and works perfectly . 
if a larger size becomes available i would recommend it instead . 
it takes a few uses to determine what grind you want and how long to have it run . 
no issues on this item . the mic is clear . 
i have used it about num_num times thus far and no problems . update :  num_num weeks later it no longer works . 
only negative is that that the model i have has a proprietary charger . 
i will update this review if that does happen . 
since i am always on my phone ,  the battery life is very short . 
it is built extremely well ,  and works great . 
the instructions warn that the blades are very sharp ,  and they are . 
i find that i get less cracking by punching holes which i used to do with a push pin . 
i use them to listen to podcasts ,  music ,  whatever . 
it cooks everything to perfection all in one pan . 
for the price i paid $ this is a value right up there with a zippo lighter . 
this oxo good grips measuring cup set coordinates well with my stainless steel kitchen . 
which is a relief because those are getting harder to find in basic black . 
at first ,  seeing lots of plastic ,  i was a bit worried . 
his equipment and service far exceeds normal  wand  steam cleaners ,  and represents the best that the industry has . 
my kitchen area was very limited when i purchased this . 
i used to buy large sweater bags from the container store . 
the key to success ,  i think ,  is to simply follow the directions . 
i don t use it indoors so i can t review it that way . 
the thermos nissan num_num oz was bought specifically to be used during kicksled trips to the teton area backcountry . 
the extra resolution is apparent with web pages zoomed out and console programs . 
this will be much less of a problem if you vacuum thoroughly just before using the steamvac . 
great shipping . the product s suction caps do not stay in place . 
compared to my old one  ! it is heavy as a few folks mention . 
i felt comfortable enough to drop my iphone as a demonstration for my brother . 
in addition to the loss of one s driving privileges this violation could lead to a jail sentence . 
it gets the lettuce really dry ,  which makes the dressing stick to it better  for a yummier salad !   . 
definitely helps from breaking the dough when placing into pan ,  just makes the process faster . 
the iphone num_extend fits perfectly in this case . 
this was a gift for my oldest daughter . 
only downfall .  .  . wish it had battery backup installed on the clock and timer . 
it is difficult to put it on correctly . 
i saw this and hoped that it would help solve my kitchen organization problems . 
still ,  it clips on fairly easily ,  although i take extra care when removing it to avoid splattering melted sugar . 
there is a reason for this . when you first open the package you see the headset all folded up . 
this was the perfect headset that i needed for use with the rosetta stone . 
you can use them for everything from spaghetti sauce to mashed potatoes . 
i am completely satisfied with the transaction ,  shipping ,  and functionality of this product . 
it is used every single day ,  and after years of service it still grinds perfect coffee . it s super quiet . 
it was easy to assemble and in good condition . 
for me these scoops have been one of the best investments for my baking . 
the size allows me to keep the pot on the stove with other pots and pans . 
it was not an obvious defect and an easy overlook on revere s quality control . 
takes up less room as i can stand it on end on my kitchen counter . 
these are a very nice size and can be hard to find . 
i haven t used it yet but it is well made ,  sharp and should do its intended job well . 
it went back for a refund ,  which was a real nuisance . 
i went with the one that doesn t turn and am quite pleased . 
carrying this portable external charge made my life very easy . 
i got clear so it matches my maroon car . 
it s also hotter as other reviewers have stated . 
some of the post said they will rust had them for a while now no rust . 
while this has a magnet closure ,  i was sure to choose one that clasped away from the credit cards . 
just in time !  the week after we ordered this ,  our washing machine broke . 
the cable is much longer and thicker than the original . 
i often rinse quiona or rices only to lose some down the drain . 
among the huge positives :  num_extend brews a superb pot of coffee !  that s most important ,  and here it s a winner . 
that cover included is very nice and my daughter loves it . 
it is superior to the round cutters we used on frozen pizza s . 
the regular yeast takes num_num hours and num_num minutes ,  due to preheating and rising . 
this case is really cute and easy to put on . 
this is the second one that we have purchased ,  since our first one wore out . 
they sell bigger sets on here for cheaper ,  but made by a different company . 
it does what it says it will do and sucks water back out of the carpet . 
there is no way to take the snug tension down a notch . 
it does have a significant amount of play . 
three led lights indicate power ,  you will need it . 
not sure if the software upgrade was in my phone or the bluetooth  must be the num_extend
just flush with running water and everything comes out . 
anyway i would suggest this to anyone that has the num_extend phone much over the seido innocell . 
there is a recessed light just above it . 
the hole at the bottom of the pan is too wide . 
it ends up being the perfect amount of food . this version .  .  . sold in the us with english packaging .  .  . contains a spork . 
i am always leery buying products like this at a reduced price ,  but this time i was not disappointed . 
worth the money !  great for hamburgers to steaks and hot sandwiches . 
my only compliant with the last one is that i felt that it didn t go loud enough sometimes . 
tie a broomstick on the cat and mop up the flour . 
i bought the stainless steel for it s durablity and in the first num_num weeks have not been disappointed . 
i actually saw it recommended on  america s test kitchen  ,  and i agree with them . 
otherwise it will explode like a rocket when you remove it from a bottle . 
i m not a fan of the color but i am a fan of this scoop . 
my old timer died ,  or rather it faded away ,  and this seems to be a great replacement . 
for this reason i make enought for two mugs and unplug it after is stops perking . 
i am also glad we bought the num_extend quart over a num_num quart pot . 
ie the bank of america app on the ipod touch wouldn t connect . 
have only done oranges so far and it really gets all the juice out . 
the marking holes and slots on this protractor are great . 
the person on the phone says it all sounds great . 
highly recommend this if you have a standard faucet that can use this . 
so i used palmolive dish soap in the vac bin . 
inexpensivequalityworks for many larger smart phones  i use the num_extend
solid heavy cast iron not cheap foreign import . 
it gets misalligned with use ,  so it s easy to fix . 
when it snaps into the holster  ,  it is more than secure . 
has lasted for quite a while ,  putting the phone in and out for all the workouts . 
rather pay $ for a good phone case than replace my phone . 
this limits your selection to only the frieling ,  bodum double wall ,  and the insulated cups from planetary design . 
i like the pink one for baking and mixing the ingredients . 
it s such a great product that i recommend you try out for yourself . 
this is num_extend and i blew a fuse on my num_extend power converter . 
so far i have tried it on two external drives . 
it doesn t stick ,  it cooks to perfection ,  and it s easy to clean . 
great investment that i don t see replacing anytime soon . 
frieling is innocent of misrepresentation here :  it is customer ignorance that is at fault . 
after num_num years ,  the lid broken ,  but it still works . i got this one and love it . 
i watched a you tube video on this first . 
i bought the set in num_num and they held up wonderfully even with cleaning in the dishwasher . 
makes fantastic coffee everytime and is so easy to use . 
my wife has this battery and i have the num_extend
as another review said if it passes alton browns requirements it most definelty good enough for me . 
i ve used it countless times since i got it for christmas two years ago . 
i turned my iphone off at % and plugged this in for about the same time ,  probably less . 
couldn t even bite into the lip of the can . 
it is easy to use ,  safe and protects the blade . 
the whole process took only about num_num minutes . 
never had a slide case but elago never fails . 
you can hang all your pots and have the lids covering them on the same hook . 
the kitchenaid is an indispensable kitchen tool ,  and these attachments just serve to make it all the more useful . 
we do everything from baking bread and muffins in it ,  to making casseroles ,  to frozen pizzas to bagels . 
it s one of the best brands of pots and pans out there . 
protects the phone completely and its not bulky . 
i believe that wusthof makes the finest knives you can buy . 
using an in door grill pan is a skill that takes time to develop . 
i had a press that i d been using for years until the hinge finally popped on it . 
i had an old mirro cooker num_extend that i used for over num_num years . 
this dual set of lenses really opens up the quality of photos you can take . 
it is dishwasher safe and it sharpens up nicely . 
finally ,  there was not a screen protector with the ballistic case . 
the keys are num_extend dimensional  ,  covered with a type of plastic not unlike that on a microwave oven . 
give me flames and oil anytime . people complain about the thin aluminum pan and plastic gears . 
this was crazy easy to use and definitely made a lovely final product . 
the lid makes it great for storing extras . 
it makes great popcorn without any oils or butter etc . 
i have used this for both indoor and outdoor cooking with chicken ,  beef ,  and pork . 
never dropped . when i set the timer for under three minutes ,  it never went off . 
there is even a curved pull out handle on the front . 
i haven t found that to be the case . 
a  church key  ,  used very gently ,  works well . 
you won t go wrong with these bowls and they are an excellent value to boot . 
the memo holder has a place for a pen . 
the variety of speeds is appropriate and useful . 
we have been buying cuisinart appliances for more than twenty years and have never had a complaint . 
it uses a finely machined metal to metal surface to seal the lid . 
the sound is great !  the fit is great . 
it fits my samsung galaxy num_extend phone beautifully . 
my samsung galaxy s num_extend came with a pair of these headphones in the box . 
i do recommend that you season it before using it and after each time it is used . 
i can now go overnight without charging my phone at all . 
this product was usable right out of the box . 
lid has a nice heavy feel to it and when you lock it ,  it is a very solid lock . 
i moved from an num_extend with this same series case to an num_extend with the case . 
it fits in a suitcase and plugs in anywhere and ensures that i always have a charged batter available . 
i have been using it for a year and it still is in good shape . 
battery lasts all day and most of the evening . 
a proprietary charging interface means one more wire to carry with me . in summary ,  a great purchase . 
so don t expect for it to be deadly silent  : b . 
this product was perfect for what i needed .  .  . drying meat ,  fruits and veggies . 
you can sort of feel it when it is in num_extend
i bought it ,  and i love it !  not much more to say ,  really . 
i got these because they were recommended for the bunn coffee maker . 
in addition ,  i can store in the refrigerator or on the buffet and it will stay cool . 
i have one of these and a stand up steamer and a good cleaners . 
i liked this tea pot without a protruding spout . 
as other reviewers have mentioned ,  this product would be improved if it had a removable ,  dishwasher safe mixing bowl . 
i don t use paper filters any longer ,  but you could for less mess . 
i have been using a belkin stylus for a couple of years . 
got num_num of them for $ so i cant complain about anything ,  all of them work . 
they do just what they are supposed to and are very easy to use . 
i bought num_num of these expecting only couple would work ,  but amazingly all of them worked . 
as my iphone num_extend gets older ,  the more battery it seems to suck up throughout the day . 
i don t bother trying to do stairs with the main vacuum . 
then i spray everything clean with hot water until everything rinses clear . 
it was more than sufficient back in the hotel room . 
i am cleaning my carpets all the time either with the vacuum or with my new shampooer . 
i don t find emptying the dirt cup to be much of an issue as some people do . 
this is for the droid num_extend not the droid x . 
the handles don t stick up too high and interfere with cooking or washing . 
i have had this for about num_num months now . 
otterbox makes excellent cases and this one is no exception . 
i am surprised at this price that this was identical to the iphone screen i replaced . 
other european num_extend chef s knives will certainly be heavier . the steel is easy to care for . 
it is pleasant to touch ,  flexible but never saggy . 
this straw holder is attractive ,  sturdy ,  holds plenty of straws ,  and is easy to use . 
they will build brown gunk over time even on nonstick surfaces . 
i like the feel of the phone in my hand . 
keep enough water in the brita container to keep at least part of the filter wet at all times . 
i loved this thing but i forgot the name ,  etc . 
some stores will even let you cut some veggies right there . 
i don t like clutter on my kitchen counters and knives dumped in a drawer can be a little dicey . 
i bought this ,  and am happy with it . 
i do recommend it because it does cook well . 
it still doesn t taste good ,  but it tastes very mildly bad . 
can t wait to mash baby food with it . 
after that ,  i keep it clean and dry when not in use . 
the only negative is the handle somehow feels too big or chunky in my hand . 
 i love it by the way and still use .   but one does not need espresso every day . 
bought these to replace my old oster blender gasket . 
unlike paper filters ,  it does not absorb the coffee s natural oils so you get a better tasting coffee . 
to my surprise the rings fit my newer one also so i m set if either blender starts leaking . 
i ve never run them through the dishwasher ,  but i don t see a problem with doing so . 
clean up is easy and the unit feels solid including the switch . 
this battery pack provides a ton of juice in a compact package . 
i wanted to be able to use a smaller block in a space challenged corner of my counter . 
a bit more expensive than most measuring cup sets ,  but they should outlast a lot of cheaper sets . 
it also helps protect the screen because even gorilla glass breaks easily if you hit it on the edge . 
my first yogurt maker did not have a timer and that was inconvenient at times . 
so much easier than the traditional tops for mason jars . 
before i got this ,  i found my knives were always dull after a few uses . 
i already ordered one for my bf and i would def order another one !  . 
very nicely constructed and heavy guage puts away my fear of owning my first pressure cooker . 
it is definitely sturdier than my old pastry cutter . 
you don t need to fit the disc down to the bottom because the grinds don t compress to the bottom . 
i picked one of these up based strictly on price . 
being able to adjust the flow is very useful . 
having gone thru several can openers in my lifetime this one is by far the best of all . 
they shipped on time and arrived in excellent condition . 
this product performs well and was a good price . 
i know its an older product ,  but it works extremely well . 
they look quite nice and worked for charging my phone . 
i have cut back on sugar a lot . 
i store it on an upturned lid from a can of baking powder . 
or maybe that is how friends like to cook their meat . 
it sometimes makes a wierd clicking sound while at a high speed . 
i had one where the long silver tube kept coming off ,  so i just threw it away . 
the slide out crumb tray in the back makes for easy cleaning . 
i tend to keep kitchen tools until they keel over . 
the generously padded ear pieces are very comfortable to wear ,  even after long periods . 
and for only a buck you can t go wrong . 
i even emailed hoover to tell them so . 
doesn t cut through meat all of the way at the bottom . 
it is easy to control and does not show air bubbles in the icing easily . 
these corelle glass dishes are a good investment . 
there is probably better ,  but i m perfectly satisfied . 
we had this exact same coffee maker for a number of years and we were always pleased . 
the pictures do not do this knife justice . 
i usually do it in the microwave for num_extend or a bit longer . 
had a little issue with the silicone part staying on the plastic case at first but it s gotten better . 
if you dry them ,  rather than let them air dry you can cut down on the spots . 
for that reason i give this item num_num stars . 
it is a little pricey ,  but worth the price of entry . 
this is my first piece of le creuset and i will definitely be back for more . 
not only has this piece performed flawlessly ,  but the entire set i received has too . 
my num_extend did not have the power keep a ipad on much less charge it . 
whipped up whip cream in short time  with cold bowl and beaters  . 
i highly recommend these headsets to any blackberry user . 
it takes the place of an app killer app like you need on the thunderbolt . 
ok yes it took almost a month to get here . 
even if you just make a grilled cheese ,  it s better tasting then on the stovetop . 
my wife is not really into technology ,  but she is into talking on her cell phone . 
i love the quality and colors of these stylus pens . 
sure ,  there are some $ models out there but they are not worth wasting your time . 
these shakers look like they do in their advertisement;colorful and bright . 
i m not a fan of red lights on things ,  especially in a car . 
wonderful purchase it has helped me out tremendously . 
the sound is clear ,  though the volume ,  if used for watching video ,  is a little low . 
it is fast and the suction is great . 
failed once after a year but got a replacement at no charge  no shiiping charge either  from holmes . 
these felt dividers are thicker than what comes with the micro fiber deluxe plate case . 
happy the auto shut off has been extended to num_num hours . 
the only thing that came up were pages on how to create your own icons . 
great kitchen investment for only the cost of a double whopper . 
so ,  my recommendation is to play it safe and stay with the solid back to basics peel away . 
i no longer need to grease a pan or have a stuck cookie on a sheet . 
these look just like the ones that come with the new phones . 
i ve used a few different sizes  and own two of these myself  . 
it gets pretty sad tasting when the pot is dirty . i have to edit the cleaning part . 
eventually and then frequently it will become a necessity . 
my brother commented on them ,  so he is getting a surprise set for his new home . 
my saeco aroma  second machine  died again after about num_num months . 
screen is very responsive and i like the num_num customizable home screens and folders etc . 
she has small hands ,  so the num_extend suits her well . 
it s great to no longer have to wait until vacuum day to get those crumbs off the floor . 
my battery is dying and the phone is only num_num months old ,  so this is a live saver !  . 
it fits in my ear very well ,  it s comfortable to me ,  and the sound is great . 
stereo headset allows for music to be played or streamed as well from devices . 
easy install and the hooks are curved up just enough so what ever you are hanging won t fall off . 
my husband gets compliments on this case all the time . 
this helps make a little difference when you are icing a cake . 
the water level is very easily seen compared to my other coffemaker . 
this one is so well made that it will probably outlive me . 
i d just send the seller a message here on amazon and see what phone they are selling . cheers !  . 
it pours as smooth as a fat man preserving every drop of nectar . 
for small jobs this is a great cutting board . 
it puts out a lot of pepper with just a few twists . 
looks like the real gameboy ha ha ha . 
case is small and thin . because of me picking at it ,  it broke in a few weeks . i like the case . 
i ve been using this for several weeks now and it does quite well . 
it keeps my phone together when i drop it and it looks stylish . 
the directions are easy to follow ,  and the bread is delicious . 
for the price with free shipping from amazon ,  you can t go wrong . 
do not put in dishwasher !  just wipe out with moist towel . 
the retractor keeps the cord out of the way and locks out at the length you need . 
i replaced the cord with one in another room and discovered the problem to be the cord itself . 
makes splitting wood a much faster task with a super sharp blade . 
so far it has stayed in our oven even when we don t use it . 
all holes fits perfectly as well unlike some products which tend to be slightly off . 
exactly what i was looking for !  a nice combination of form ,  function ,  and durability . 
it easily goes from stove top to oven . 
most of the muffin mixes come in servings of num_extend so there is almost always a bit left over . 
i was a little disappointed as getting the can started can be a bear . 
i tried them with my nokia num_extend and they sounded fantastic . 
a well made skillet that is one of the best on the market . 
shipping is typically less than num_num days if not faster and the order process is clean . 
i ordered a second and it s perfect for my pound cake batter . 
i m cleaning them by hand but its really easy . 
the dial settings are from num_num to num_extend
this device goes with me where ever i do . 
i d rather deal with a hot handle than cool handles and a poor waffle !  . 
it is relatively cool on the outside when the water is hot . 
anything thicker than pancake batter ,  however ,  will severely test this whisk . 
give it a try with amazon you can always send it back !  but i bet you won t . 
i got one for me ,  one for a friend . 
i have large serving bowls ,  also from corelle ,  made of the same material . 
it is next to impossible to find fault with almost anything that oxo makes . 
you can flip between voice calls and songs easily enough . 
highly recommended ,  and once you have one ,  you ll wonder what you did without it !  . 
also ,  this comes with a car charger included . 
a big step up from the wooden juicer i was using before !  . 
you can cut num_extend or num_extend slices or the same size options in julienne strips . 
this is the best cover for the iphone . 
the one who likes to peel with a knife ,  rather than with a peeler . 
highly recommended if you are using the booster this is intended for . 
now can make home made sausages and stuff them which is a great advantage for home cooking . 
so far ,  it has poured very neatly with no dripping . 
a few phones out now can use up to num_extend
this is the perfect answer to storage in a kitchen with small cabinets . the best part :  no assembly required . 
it s easy to wind up and lasts quite a long time in between . sturdy and easy to clean . 
that same cable enables my droid to hook to my hp num_extend num_extend pixel display . 
i don t know how anyone could rate it less than five stars . 
you will find yourself reading it over and over ,  makign flowers over and over . 
some are overkill or just too overbuilt ,  but i think this is there sweetspot and they have consistent quality . 
the four pack was good and at a good value . 
great world map ,  i bought this for my son . 
i figured it was time to write a quick review after three years of regular use . 
these work great and keep the wine bottle vacuumed . 
he went to school for baking and loves to make creations . 
just don t get them wet; they get hot with the quickness if they re wet . 
in fact ,  i am planning to buy one more for another pantry ingredient i commonly use . 
in the last day ,  i ve made pizza dough ,  bagels ,  and whole wheat bread . 
love the way it look on my phone ,  beautiful . 
i purchased these for camping and they are wonderful . 
i make fresh pasta ,  pie crust ,  and a whole lot more in just seconds . 
so ,  my advise to you is forget the protective screen thing . 
this works great !  we use it on our patio . 
i can lift the bowl and do it that way ,  but it is awkward . 
i know they are a bit pricey but so are the things you put in them . 
big disappointment !  !  !  small feature that is great for heavy business conf call usage . 
or ,  you can use ice . this machine proportions it all perfectly . 
i wish they would come out with a magnetic bar that was a matte or brushed steel finish . 
i love the peekaboo flaps along one side . 
no waste . so which is better ?  for zucchini and cukes ,  the horizontal machine is a little better . 
as long as you don t need num_extend this is a great phone . 
so ,  i still give it a num_num star rating . 
the price is very reasonable and the shipping was so fast . 
i was just looking for replacement part ,  but they don t make it . 
i purchased this grinder solely for the purpose of grinding flax seeds and it has served me well . 
i bought this blender at the same time i bought the book ,  green for life ,  by victoria boutenko . 
don t force it or you can break the juicer . 
it can handle anything !  i chop everything in it like nuts ,  onions ,  celery ,  tomatoes ,  jalapenos .  .  .  . and it literally takes seconds . 
i came across this little number ,  found the design interesting ,  and ordered it . for $ this case is amazing . 
i enjoy listening to my iphone while i do . 
android phones tend to be notorious for quickly killing the phone battery . 
anyway ,  it works good as a second wall charger . 
it is a nice set and a great price for all num_extend
it is used on a daily basis ,  and i still don t have a single complaint about it . 
don t be cheap .  . use the best !   .  . awesome ,  dependable protection . 
i have found that square pans are much more functional than round ,  finding square pans is difficult . 
we have also cooked vegetables in it and theyhave turned out nicely . 
it can be knocked off the desk and not shatter like many lighter weight dishware products . 
bought this as well as a few other accesories after seeing the pricing of amazon versus verizon . 
they are a little shorter than i d like appearance wise ,  but tasted delicious . 
this is the second one i have purchased . 
i have cooked steak ,  salmon and chicken on it ,  seems to work well . 
we dip those babies in honey mustard ,  so it was all good . 
the cartridges that come with the opener last a long time . 
also it had a num_extend micro sd in it . 
sometimes i leave my phone on the desk and walk away . 
the case offers protection and is well formed to the phone . 
the apps that can be used and features that are useable have already been mentioned in other posts . 
what can you say about a chip bag . 
just don t forget to spray with cooking spray before use !  . 
needed another charging cord for my husband phone for at work . 
it includes the meat grinder ,  slicer ,  shredder ,  pouring shield ,  with slicing and shredding cones . 
the grip on the handles are comfortable and they close very easy and release on its own very easily . 
sigh ,  a near disaster was only barely averted by chance and a passing martian .  .  . but that is another story . 
the mirro stainless steel food mill is good quality at a great price . 
but it doesn t fit when i use the standard apple iphone num_num bumper . 
but i don t think it s the products fault ,  that is just the way they hang . 
i really can t say anything again about this cutter . 
i have owned this bread maker for num_num years and really love it . 
i search for bargains and i m all about trying to save a dollar . 
it does a good job on the three different samsung batteries i have . 
i am toying with the idea of buying the  huge  one for my hoilday turkeys and hams . 
it came in yesterday and when i took it out of the box i was surprised . 
in the car ,  whilst walking the dog ,  and in a food court ,  this headset performed comparably . 
i use my hub with my imac and it works seamlessly ,  have had no issues . 
yet stays where you put it without sliding under normal circumstances . 
it makes perfect ,  tasty popcorn with hardly any kernels left over unpopped . 
this little tamper is ideal for my delonghi expresso maker . 
excellent product  made in america  and from a  very customer oriented manufacturer . 
as a speaker phone it works well too . 
when using them for calling ,  only the left earpiece delivers sound ,  which is sort of weird . 
highly recommend for small jobs and under things the big shark vac can t reach . 
i don t know whether they really are the same . 
no fluorocarbons and i know exactly what oil i m using for my family . 
this fan solved the problem nicely . i had no issue installing it . 
i didn t even think it could rust ,  let alone do it on its first contact with water . 
but i didn t want to pay full price . 
pros :  handy for all sorts of meals and cooking . 
this unit only expands wide enough to hold my htc phone . 
the top easily is removed from the pitcher . 
 i have owned this for about num_num weeks  highly recommend this !  . 
 it attaches by a little suction cup  this case is amazing . 
these are the best ,  if it fits you budget . 
this time i was looking for some inexpensive chef s knives ,  and as the reviews appeared glowing i bought one . 
husband wanted it for his group of guys when they are cooking outside . 
it is very important not to skip any of these steps . 
and it s great for cooking pasta ,  if you don t already have a pasta pot . 
did web research and it pointed us to this coffee maker . 
uh ,  i have no idea what all the fuss is about ,  concerning how loud it is . 
when the waffle is ready ,  the device beeps . 
the grind is consistent and my coffee is always perfect . 
the timer is small ,  so you don t have a big clunky thing hanging around your neck . 
you can make phone calls with this while your phone is plugged in . 
very easy to store them as well and sizes are perfect for just any thing . 
after visiting my bother who topped everything with homemade whipped cream ,  we could not resist . 
some folks use parchment paper on the stone; i prefer a little corn meal . 
if you can handle a screwdriver ,  you won t have any problems . 
but there is a trick that can help . 
slight pressure on hood pushes the coffee filter down for brewing . 
it has crisp sound and it has theatre quality sound with the ipad when watching movies . 
i feared something running dry in the middle of the night . 
they work great and are priced great too !  !  . 
in a matter of seconds ,  the tray is clean . 
here is how i break it down : cost  + other filters are very expensive to replace . 
we bought this roaster to be able to cook a num_extend turkey in . 
i currently use this set in my pantry and it is a nice slim design . 
i already own a lodge num_extend cast iron skillet ,  but for that low price ,  now i have two . 
i find that the fence isn t rigid enough to keep the tolerances of thinner slicing . 
it comes with everything you would want and the itunes store is great . i like my htc sensation . 
whips cream and egg whites so fast you better not turn your back . 
we have three blade safes for our victorinox knives . 
after it died from the original charge ,  i left it charging over night for about num_num hours . 
however ,  i prefer this as i am getting rid of plastics in my food prep ,  cooking and storage . 
the little pushpin device helps get the extra gunk out . 
i have some old ones that i would like to return or recycle . 
it will also have a much longer battery life !  . 
protein and starch in the big slot  i . e . 
this one obviously is coated and does not have that problem . 
my son says he has dropped it and it literally bounced with no damage to the phone whatsoever . 
take slicer and start twisting down into the pineapple . 
my husband is a meatcutter and needed a new steel at work . 
the leftover coffee i pour into a thermal carafe so it doesn t get bitter sitting in the press . 
well ,  turns out this ring is needed to cook efficiently on top of the burner . 
these are very sturdy and have nice handles; they also come easily off the ring without a fuss . 
it is a good purchase for the price . 
it s big too and pours well ,  and for a good price . 
it is a perfect size and isnt heavy either . 
no real need for it if the cups just live in the pantry . 
doesn t require electricity either ,  so you can make coffee during a power outage !  . 
had one like this to two years ,  it broke . 
i can t say if they leak or not . 
i recommend this for anyone who has a iphone num_extend
it takes longer to clean than for the coffee to be brewed . 
i use this unlocked phone with cingular in the los angeles area . the num_extend and cool looking . 
for the price i would say they are probably a good value . 
i was nervous that the yellow would be too dark but it is not . 
it works but its really thin and will break easy . 
should this one breakdown ,  i ll replace it with the same exact model . 
this is a very good set of tongs that is reasonably priced . 
the flexible arm is a nice circular solid material that feels like a rubber coated large gauge aluminum wire . 
i bought this product for a baby shower and it looked beautiful on the table . 
the regular mouth sealer however was returned as it did not work . 
great product ,  but from where do you ship ?  it took almost num_num weeks for me to get it . 
i took those other bread slicers off my  wish list  . 
i purchased this timer to replace an earlier version of the same timer that stopped working . 
i don t go through them fast ,  so should last a long time . 
kids are excited about our  new  plates and bowls . 
yes ,  you do have to be gentle with the holder but that is common sense . 
it s got great suction and i look forward to using it for many years to come . 
i researched crock pots and slow cookers until i was presented with this model . 
i would buy this waffle iron again in a heartbeat . 
this battery just barley gets me through the day but it does it . 
i wouldn t want it to be crazy heavy . 
we always eat in front of the t . v . 
this is a great product ,  material feels like i can use it for a long time . 
you might even be able to find somebody who can sharpen your knives that way for free . 
i bought this for my sprint galaxy num_extend
years and years !  so many i ve lost track . 
we own the earlier version of this juicer ,  the toastmaster num_extend for years and years now . 
all the power you need for your everyday work tasks and communication fitted into the palm of your hand . 
i got my order pretty much on num_extend day late with free shipping . 
i got this unit free when i purchased the new trent icarrier num_extend dual usb external battery pack . 
these screen protectors work pretty well for me and will fit the iphone num_extend and num_extend
one cause for the bad loaves complained of may be inexperience with these machines . 
anything from scrambled eggs to hamburger helper ! i jus love it . 
since paper filters impart paper flavor ,  you should be rinsing the filter first before using it . 
the replacement process is tedious ,  and you have to be careful ,  but it can be done . 
the goal is to produce fond ,  so you can make a flavorful pan sauce . 
just a notch before medium heat is perfect . 
so easy to install no tools required ; great tasting water . 
clips to everything when and where i need it . 
i like the long blades though ,  as they make short work of the breads ,  regardless of loaf size . 
i had bought one of the cast aluminum citrus press a week before and broke it after one day . 
you can simply feel the top quality of these pans . 
i m using the key lime oil next time in hopes of a key lime pie taste . 
these are great and priced very well !  they are sturdy and built well !  they will hold up !  !  . 
this ss version does not hold odors and washes up nice ,  especially after using it for hot pepper jellies . 
when keyboard is out ,  you can tilt the screen up . 
it is easy ,  it is well written and everything but the dairy itself is supplied . 
this cucinapro num_num sounded pretty good ,  and the price was right . 
great case ,  fits perfect . i have the frost case ,  just wondering how long it may stay that way . 
and not girlish at all ,  as i thought it might be from the pictures . 
it was pretty much wet from the shaken lettuce and slightly moist from the spun . 
i loved watching the coffee being brewed in this ,  and still think it s a cool product . 
could ve been designed better . the design and construction of the rubber tip housing of the ear pieces is bad . 
more handy than i ever thought it would be . 
sorry apple but this is a winner . i think samsung really got a great phone !  !  !  . 
i am not a whiskey drinker ,  but my husband is . 
however ,  if i m traveling ,  it s a bit more dicey . 
i was shocked when it arrived to find how sturdy and heavy this garlic press was . 
i bought these after exhaustive research on knives and wanting a good set . 
it makes my iphone num_extend looks like the iphone c . 
don t be scared off by the negative reviews . 
it s also difficult to keep the blade in the proper position . 
num_num minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a wendy s frosty . 
i am torn about how to write this review . 
this has been a nice alternative to bottled water service . 
but for making batches of cookies or cakes ,  this works perfect for me . 
this item was perfect ,  exactly like how you see it . 
she loved the color itself as well as the chrome affect to it . 
now planning on getting two more of the same . 
wasnt as big as i thought it would be around the phone . 
i also found the price from amazon ,  really competitive . 
the gripping mechanism works operates smoothly and reliably after several runs through the dishwasher . 
this mount is wonderful for any kind of biking you can throw at it . 
it just turns off after a few seconds . 
cook pancakes on medium heat or setting num_num out of num_extend
the day that i received my mixer ,  the price dropped from $ to $
i was in a do or die situation . 
this was a birthday gift for my daughter . 
it is a good knife and i would recommend it . florence maruyama ,  customer . 
however ,  in my quest for the best coffee maker ,  i found this cuisinart central brew coffee maker . 
the cleaning tool isn t attached to the press  some presses have this feature  so it s easily lost . 
i ll let you know how it works out . the bowls themselves  i already have four  ,  are great . 
which is pretty cool since you won t have to press a button just to see the time . 
i d love to give these out as gifts . 
i just received my otterbox and after all the positive reviews on amazon i m glad i chose it . 
i like is so much ,  i just bought another one for my mom . 
i saw a demonstration in which this type of tenderizer was used to make cube steak . 
heats water about % faster than a similar steel pot . 
good style is essential to any apple design . 
the pack also did not run hot while it was charging up the phone which is a definite plus . 
the product is just what i was looking for . 
it activates my selection much easier and more consistently than my finger num_extend
i had it in a couple of days . 
this was the perfect size for my oven . 
i wish i had more but they are a bit pricey so i move it around during cooking . 
pressure cooking reduces cooking time for many dishes . 
everything else went smoothly . this shoe tree is heavy which is a good thing . 
i was able to aerate a num_num ml bottle in a matter of seconds . 
my search is over !  it doesn t require pads or other disposable junk . 
this is a powerful mixer that makes baking an easy task . 
i recieved these for a gift several years ago and use them every day . 
this popper is just like the one i remember growing up . 
really ,  not bad at all ,  considering the convenience . 
i like these because i can cut any size i need . 
it will provide some protection from scratches and falls . 
everything i have of theirs the coating is flaking ,  peeling ,  or worn off . 
like your cellphone ,  this vacuum charges in a dock where it sits and then you can use it . 
the large canister does not hold a full bag of flour ,  at least not a num_num lb . 
however ,  since the product lasted num_num years ,  i am still satisfied that i got my money s worth . 
as always ,  amazon shipped item and i received in num_num days . 
i do this because it makes it super easy for me to move things on and off the stone . 
it is the sturdiest mixer i have ever used . 
i ll be back in a year  hopefully not sooner  to give some time perspective to this review . 
remember ,  never wash and dust with flour if any sticking . i would buy again . 
it came in good time and seems to be just what i ordered . 
it works wonders on wrinkled suit jackets and on curtains . 
this protector was less expensive than some of the others but had great reviews . 
this black case fit my new phone great . 
i bought these for everyday use and after a few weeks of cooking in them ,  i m pretty satisfied . 
those who have used both usually have a preference . 
i am so glad that i ignored the negative reviews . 
awesome deal !  i could nt believe how easy it was to install ,  perfect fit and protection . 
it s the best one i ve had ,  and i ve had many . 
this grinder is great for regular coffee ,  and the price is right . 
i have used this earpiece and mic set while working on landscape . 
no biggie but makes me think it might be a refurb or something . 
the headphones work well with my old studio xps num_num and my new xps num_extend and my galaxy num_extend
i found  profimail  which works great for me . 
i strongly recommend the plastic body ,  which does not get hot enough to burn the skin . 
the lid ,  as mentioned before ,  retains some stains otherwise cleans up ok . 
allowing ten minutes at room temperature ensures easy removal of loaves on most occasions . 
yes ,  i too have a small hand ,  however ,  the benefits of this mitt far outway any negatives . 
simply cut a hole for the headphone and ir blaster . works for me . 
have been seasoning it periodically  without removing the existing surface  and it seems to be holding up really well . 
i bought this pan with the double boiler insert and find it a wonderful utensil for cooking . 
but when we contacted the seller ,  they sent a new base right away . 
i put it on my phone ,  only to realize it was a matte finish . 
the handles aren t strong enough and slip out easily for cleaning . 
use a large strainer placed in the mixers stainless steel bowl and you are good to go . 
i discovered it also works to charge my phone from my computer when i am at work . 
so after reading countless reviews ,  i decided to purchases this coffee maker . 
has not had any issues with the auto shutoff not working . 
i noticed that my samsung galaxy num_num note wasn t charging in my car ,  charge would stay the same . 
it will take any other usb cable you want to shove in there . 
keept in mind this does not include the charger . 
also the loaf of bread and type of bread influence outcome too . 
as external battery chargers go ,  it s fairly heavy num_extend ounces  and big num_extend
i was reading about these tumblers and they were on sale on amazon . 
it will not of course fully charge my ipad num_num but i knew that going it . 
my twins were napping and never made a sound . 
i upgraded to this phone from my beloved evo num_extend which was just running out of space on me . 
i have several spatulas and spoons for cooking but i prefer a spoon of no scratch materials . 
i got two of these in hopes to manage the disaster that was my spice cabinet . 
the difference between on his phone and off is quite noticeable . 
very sturdy bowls that fit nicely inside each other . 
pratically every day use from heavy to light cooking . 
i had a smallish pair of tongs for turning eggplant and cutlets while sauteeing . 
this is a very nice gel cover for the lg optimus v phone . 
this case is not waterproof but it has already more than paid for itself . 
she had a silicone handle on her kettle handle that apparently is safe for use when heating . 
i also use it to cut into casseroles and serve them up . 
they could do better on the price for a higher rating . 
found this on amazon and am very glad i bought it . 
after reading reviews i ordered it but was afraid of the sharp edges . 
i think it is the best electrical unit on the market for the money . 
it s go to be from the heat of the microwave . 
it makes eating with them more fun for her . 
the difference between them is so big it s hard to believe they are the same kitchen tool . 
it definitely takes the dirt off quickly and easily . 
i often have to check the edge to see if it is on the phone . 
i was impressed enough to order multiple items for myself and my family . 
that is ,  however ,  a small price to pay for a great cup of java . 
it also arrived when i expected it to . 
she was delighted with the performance and quality . 
what a bargain when you consider the price and that you get num_num for that . 
the android default music player is pitiful and double twist is a work around but nowhere near perfect . 
i wanted quality while also not spending some absurd amount . 
wish i could have found it in black ,  tho . 
i m very happy . update :  a few days ago ,  my phone fell out of my belt clip and hit the sidewalk . 
i like the size not to much to clean up . 
as long as you have the storage room the size is great . 
i like this one better than our old one that had vertical slots . 
it took about num_num and lasted about num_num years . 
you will feel the suction pulling the lid tight . 
the design of this stand is very simple and when put together it is strong and sturdy . 
i ordered it i think on a weekend and it was there by thursday a week before estimated delivery . 
i absolutely love it !  i would highly recommend this case . 
my best guess is that the modes are flat ,  treble boost ,  and bass boost . 
directions do not include street names  as regular gps num_extend
i had my hamilton beach hand blender for a little over a year . 
i think the  normal  setting is fine ,  but everyone s got different taste . 
push up on the tabs ,  and the blade comes loose . 
did five pounds of roast beef last week and had lunches for the entire week . 
i just received mine and immediatly tried grinding the pine needle like rosemary . 
supplied screws are short enough to not go through cupboard door ,  but are wide enough so rack is secured . 
yet ,  i always return to my trusted wilton one . 
i m using it with two phones which by the way ,  installation was very simple . 
this large mat can be cut .  .  . into smaller sizes for different applications . 
i must say that when i first received the turner ,  i thought it to be so flimsy . 
i simply carry thing thing in my pocket . the case itself :  i can t imagine carrying around my iphone without it . 
from freezer to fridge to microwave to soups to dry foods to everything you can think of . 
it comes with a plastic top but i bought the glass top alternative . 
i had a little trouble at first with bread falling until i adjusted the flour to salt ratio . 
had been searching for a set that was not bright red but were glazed . 
i love it !  it does fit in my purse ,  though with everything else ,  it s full now . 
i will be trying them for my other spices that i shake out like pepper flakes . 
it looks more durable than my old rubber rings . 
the case has a gloss black bezel that surrounds the front of the phone . 
i find this to be well made and reasonably priced . 
in the pot ,  it measures about num_num degrees . 
i have not had any problem with accumulated debris ,  odors ,  or with other nasty things that reviewers have described . 
my plastic measuring cups and spoons were getting pretty shotty . 
then fit nicely in the tin they come in ,  which makes them easy to store without losing any . 
it was also the most targeted for malware . 
i bought it as a gift for my mother who has limited sight . 
i highly recommend this for the everyday cook that wants to take it to the next level . 
this thing is solid ,  well constructed with no looseness and makes opening a can an almost enjoyable experience . 
because they nest and have no handles ,  they easily fit in my limited space cabinets . 
the holder is really nice and the temp . 
nice to have cheap and convenient file backup for my sketches and photos . 
because i store this atop a high cabinet ,  the handle aids me in moving it up or down . 
i serves the purpose but can be difficult to press into the charging slot of your car . 
if you use this at home ,  you may want to disconnect the signal when you go to work . 
if you re looking for sub $ headphones ,  it doesn t get any better than this . 
the corelle is lightweight ,  strong ,  chip resistant ,  made in usa ,  and now we ve found our last set of dishes !  . 
i have arthritis and slicing onions is not fun anymore . 
i m comparing it to an amazon basics rubber tipped stylus . 
my wood floors looks and feels really clean . 
this is a nice product to have in your kitchen . 
second ,  this is my num_extend new trent battery pack . 
the lid is nicely designed to allow you to vent it just the teeniest bit or full steam ahead . 
this was a gift to my cousin in law . 
it does every thing i need and does it right . 
however ,  the button on it doesn t work consistently . 
great for a college dorm when a stove isn t around . 
i believe that shure doesn t tell you this for fear of alienating technically unsophisticated customers . 
i ll just hold onto it in case something ever happens to my other one . 
i use them all of the time and they have held up well . 
the pot itself has a thick handle which is nice . 
you don t need an espresso machine with the steam nozzle to get frothy milk . 
although the original probe was defective ,  the replacement works fine  so far  . 
it is hard to write a review on a cable . 
this really is a multipurpose gadget that you will get many years and many uses from . 
i wash them by hand and they seem to hold up well and have maintained their color . 
my only dislike is it is not easy to get it to hang all three levels at level . 
as travel flatware goes ,  it s a brilliant work of art . 
also bought emerilware through another on line retailer ,  which i won t mention .  .  . but it rhymes with cutleryandmore . 
this whisk ,  while pricey ,  will probably be doing its thing long after i m gone . 
i ordered them in black for my kitchen . 
comes apart easily into a few parts to wash . 
great price for this item ,  and very easy to apply to the phone . 
my son s case was cracked and he asked if he could have it . 
light and sturdy ,  the dual cutting blade is most versatile and the handle grips well in my hand . 
works perfectly with iphone num_extend and my computer . 
it does come with a filter ,  but it is just sitting in the cavity and isn t installed properly . 
this works perfectly when i use it on my microwave s automatic  popcorn  setting . 
my router  linksys num_extend is on the list so i had to use a different router . 
it works great ,  is easy to use ,  and gets out stains like you wouldn t believe . 
material is quality and will hold up to years of use . 
the handle appears firmly attached with rivets . here s one funny thing . 
no issues with the sim ,  just verify that it is the correct size . 
these concentrators hold the oil if you want to use oil and help pop the corn faster . 
they hold up well under heat too  which made them good for making different sized crumpets  . 
that old case i had was really nice but didn t last long . 
theymake them with different color  stripes  in the middle . 
sure they are not fancy ,  but they are very good knives . 
enjoy a hot ,  tasty meal and save cash while you re at it !  . 
i doubt it was actually new but the company certainly made sure it looked nice . 
i made num_num and so i m way ahead of the game . 
the case covers the phone on all edges and corners; it is raised above the screen s surface for protection . 
that is the only reason for num_num stars instead of num_extend
this pan was much thinner ,  and was also made in china ,  not usa as the previous ones i bought . 
it doesn t have rivets that will poke out and it is not slippery when wet . 
they have tags to write on ,  front and back to the bags etc . 
i have also used it with limes ,  oranges ,  and a small grapefruit with good results . 
also ,  it chops vegetables to the perfect size without making them into puree . 
the oxo softworks meat tenderizer is very nice and i love that it is dishwasher safe . 
these are very quite  at the low setting  compared to other fans and move so much air . 
my rice cookers by other brands in the past broke within the first year . 
you won t be able to get it perfectly clean ,  but you don t need to ,  so don t sweat it . 
it was packed well and it arrived in good time thanks . 
if you want maximum protection for your bb curve ,  buy the otterbox !  . 
the wide hooks make it easy to place the keys on the rack by touch rather than looking . 
and did i mention it s a steal at this price ?  go for it . 
it is a very pretty cover and i get compliments on it all the time . 
i was smart enough to keep my face away from the bowl when i lifted the lid though . 
i would have never thought such a small feature could turn out so handy . 
i usually stick it in the dishwasher with no problems ,  but it is also incredibly easy to handwash . 
the lambskin leather has a good feel and the case is attractive . 
we live in company housing so the less holes we can make the better and these did the trick . 
the tap water at my church is less than wonderful for drinking . 
this could possibly be due to my htc phone . 
this will sound strange ,  but you will actually fall in love with it . 
i ve tried other bluetooth headsets which all died due to sweat getting into the electronics . 
we also have the pasta extruder ,  juicer ,  and meat grinder attachments . 
i really don t think this case could be made any better . 
it really helps keep my husband s ties organized . 
this is an issue because the lid that you have to flip open is pretty flimsy . 
or any that i would want to use . 
for those online shopping :  it s shorter but heavier than your average tv remote . 
if i ever need to buy another one ,  i am going to stick with the sharp product line . 
and now that it s assembled ,  i m very happy with it . 
do some serious research into what you want vs . 
also looks nice for cookies ,  brownies ,  or cupcakes . 
i wish the alert beeped a bit louder . 
this is the first time i owned a pressure cooker . 
i stack mine without the loop it came with and hand wash them . 
it has never been a problem to store since it doesn t take up much space . 
this thing works wonders for my oxo num_extend chef knife . 
the reason i gave it num_num stars is that there was a plastic smell coming from the bowl . 
it could stand a few small design improvements to earn num_num stars . 
i only wish the plastic protector would stay on . 
how did i live all my life without this thing . 
i do like the different size holes in the shaker caps that come with it . 
it s a little more versital that the regular num_extend high skillet . 
what was once the most awful , messy cabinet in my kitchen is now the most organized . 
sometimes you need your shelves close together ,  so that s why i say that . 
even though i went over the recommended measurement of the bowl for liquids ,  there were no leaks . 
the pocket clip makes it easy to keep on hand with you as you move to stove or grill . 
this kept us from putting holes in the new cabinets . 
however ,  the last protector i tried had an overhang; not having to trim it is nice . 
i think that every household in the world should have one of these . 
i have wanted one of these for years and couldn t be happier with my purchase . 
we are both very pleased with the results . 
for me ,  not a big deal ,  i ve learned what not to put in there . 
the design is nice with the ability to bake num_num tacos a time . 
i used to call this a dish bucket . 
i don t see a difference between this and the one i got with my phone s original purchase . 
i use this at work and love it . 
as with all of the fiesta products i have purchased it is perfect . 
in fact ,  it is more powerful than any other i ve used . 
it does the rest of the work for you !  highly recommend !  . 
saw this online and gave it a try . 
i highly recommend this glassware ,  but like i stated earlier ,  would hand wash only . 
the interface isn t what i d call exceptionally intuitive . 
it helps keep my sink area organized and the holder is easy to keep clean . 
we only regret not having purchased the complete set of strainers instead of buying one by itself . 
i have wusthof , shun and other japanese knives and this is the sharpest of all . 
however ,  i needed a more ergonomic type of handle . 
yes ,  it is big ,  but not that big . 
had it for a month now ,  so far no problems ,  works well ,  heats up water pretty quickly . 
his phone was broken and wouldn t pair with it . 
so much more comfortable than the apple ibuds you get with the unit . 
but overall ,  i m very pleased with it and am giving my parents one for christmas !  . 
i just slide it over to the door when the dryer is running . 
if the one i have ever stops working ,  i ll get another just like it . 
everything else about the phone is very light on power usage . 
this is a great set ,  and we would highly recommend it to anyone who genuinely loves to cook . 
i had no idea what the white stuff was so i assumed it was just stickers and trashed it . 
you can get away with less expensive cuts of meat when you use this tenderizer . 
what happens if your bread does or does not do certain things and how to adjust the recipie . 
knock on wood  ,  and it still looks great  after i clean it  . 
they can be handed down through the family . 
once i figured this out there was no problem . 
overall ,  for the value price the jabra is a solid option . 
it works the best on hard floors but will do thin carpets as well . 
they dont last as long as the regular battery but thats to be expected . 
no more rolling pin to get fresh pepper . 
i oil mine about once a month with mineral oil . 
the pots and pans she has now are from her wedding num_num years ago ,  cheap and thin . 
it isn t much exertion ,  but after a while it can be tiring . 
the sound quality is very good on both ends . 
if your boots have wider heels ,  as many cowboy style boots do ,  you ll likely have to do the same . 
do a lot of things in our eclectic empty nest kitchen . 
for as small as it is ,  it has exellent sound quality . 
the key number to pay attention to is the second one ,  the rated amperage . 
and you can do pancakes and bacon and fajitas and tortillas and on and on . 
so happy with my first cast iron skillet purchase !   :  it s beautiful ,  heavy bottomed ,  and perfect . 
would definitely order again and recommend to others . 
it s so much easier to see what i have now !  . 
i didn t care for the packet of flavoring that came with it . 
this is so easy to use and to clean up and put away . 
if you want a mug holder this a good one to have . 
everything that can been said about the case has already been said . 
i tried two headsets by motorola in the past ,  including num_extend
i have used the ear plugs that came with my ipod forever . 
will have to see how long it can work for . 
chop smaller quantities ,  and it is faster and more effective . 
i will update that info on here once i reach the first charging session . 
this blade has added a lot of versatility to my food processor ,  i really like it . 
that stuff creates the stickiest gooey sludge which never comes off . 
i have many pieces of fiesta and a large set of dishes . 
 :  i just made my first batch of ice cream today . 
i found the exact fit using the smallest earpiece with the little stabilizer loop . 
also ,  it would be great for sprinkling powdered sugar on baked goods !  . 
i saw alot of mixed reviews about this charger . 
i started off with one of those large centrifugal juicers . 
sometimes its off but only if the egg is too large or too small compared to the timer . 
this compost bucket for the kitchen is great . 
it does a great job of pulling in the cool air from outside and cooling the room . 
standby life is ridiculously good with the new battery . so num_extend stars for the great customer service . 
it is comfortable to hold and is not bothersome when on the phone . 
i m very satisfied with this cover for my evo . 
after purchasing this battery case i am no longer worried about running out of battery life . 
i went on amazon bought all of the items i knew we would need . 
the one improvement that i would suggest is some sort of measuring marks on the interior of the cups . 
after trying a couple of silicone spatulas i find that thats all i want in my kitchen . 
definitely for looks only ,  not much for protection but i wasn t looking for protection anyway . 
i eat num_num hours after i pack ,  sometimes later and i don t have a temperature problem . 
thin blades did sharpen eventually with practice though . it didn t do worth squat sharpening a meat cleaver . 
the case is very pretty ,  not the very best quality but it does the job and looks nice . 
the results indoors are different ,  for certain ,  but are absolutely outstanding . 
i would recommend this product for anyone looking for basic protection . 
they cost a little more than some ,  but are easily worth it . 
this battery arrived on time thanks so much for the product . 
very smooth rolling now ,  which is exactly what i wanted . 
just wipe it clean and keep it where it won t touch other objects . 
too ,  i could not leavethe grips on a long time . 
this a a great and easy way to open a wine bottle . 
she did mention the problems with the gears . 
the fan works just fine . we re very pleased with this product . 
i literally spent hours trying to  cure  my molds and pans to no avail . 
i purchased this mattress for my four grandsons when they travel with us in our rv . 
it doesn t have a tendency to tip over on its side in your hand like some other strainers do . 
there is a very small area in the center of the pan which shows the underlying metal . 
like most vacuums ,  the dyson has too many vulnerable plastic parts . 
i probably have num_num different cases that i rotate between . 
high quality that wraps around your galaxy s num_num and has a screen protector built right into it . 
and honestly ,  it s really only an aesthetic problem . 
this toaster oven ,  with intuitive keypads ,  is extremely easy to use ,  and to clean . 
just make sure you order the right size and it works as intended . 
i bought this to use as a dryer for washed items ,  and found it makes great dried fruit too . 
the only reason they aren t perfect is the lack of a hole for the charger . 
texting worked ok ,  but i wouldn t rely on it for lengthy messages . 
but at this price you could buy them every season and get a new one the next year . 
this counter is so handy because of many things . 
these are personal preference ,  and may not matter to many people . 
i have the same cookware for num_num years now and it is still like new . 
these are durable and reliable as is most pyrexware . 
i bought her this sharpener because i had one years ago and liked it . 
after a small amount of use ,  it looks and feels just like the regular ,  naked iphone num_num screen surface . 
i saw these rings ,  which complement my new shower curtain perfectly ,  in an upscale bath shop for $
it s three things in one !  it s a clock ,  a timer ,  and a time counter . 
i prefer the in ear variation on the set versus over the ear . 
didn t bubble up on my phone and didn t allow glare as bad as some do . 
i do not find the carafe lid annoyingly difficult to remove or place in position . 
i can not ,  however ,  imagine ever liking a num_num inch behemoth . 
this gives me a very nice granular control of how loud or soft i can make the volume . 
i have it on one of my pairs of headphones in my computer bag . 
the technology is straightforward ,  the quality is very good ,  and the price was great . 
that is until i purchased two of the hamilton beach air cleaner systems . 
i got this from my brother after getting one for myself . 
these plates are a decent size and are microwaveable . 
this is the insert you clip in to store the slicer ,  and it underhangs the blades quite safely . 
it weighs a ton and doesn t shake much even with a big ball of bread dough going around . 
i only wish it was bigger with more forks for more friends . 
a hair dryer and a little stretching will fix the issue . 
they used to not print the capacity on the tops ,  but now they do . 
i like how easy it is to clean ,  with the removable attachments . 
i was very mad when this carafe tapped my sink and broke into pieces . 
i really prefer the matte finish on my phone . 
it s super easy to season ,  use and clean and adds many more foods to my repertoire . 
but ,  figured i would check amazon for pricing . 
i bought this frother a month ago and use it three times a day . 
nice ,  more sturdy than i d expected for the price . 
i saw it in the store where it was selling for $
it doesn t protect the phone very much ,  but that is not the purpose . 
the first thing you need to do is use your phone to record through `voice dialing  . 
i was making coffee when i noticed a rather alarming odor ,  like something was on fire . 
 size num_extend ring finger !  soooo ,  this little gem came to my rescue for my num_extend and tab . tadgz . 
that night ,  i turned the first knob on ,  like it was on all of my other cooktops . 
more plastic than some previous droids ,  but it doesn t feel cheap in the least . 
if you re making apple dumplings ,  pie ,  etc it makes the apples look very  professional  . 
the color that they can add to a kitchen brightens every vist there . 
cooks healthy since there is no oil us for this . 
sometimes pressing it as the directions specified increased the volume . 
i use this to cook with on passenger ships and it works very well . 
wow !  i love this iphone car mount holder . 
i use this all the time for many different purposes . 
don t believe the people that say it has design flaws . they are being extremely picky . 
i dropped my phone several times while in this case and it didn t break in any way . 
just like most similar products ,  you will need a bare and unskinned num_extend
apparently the choice of oil and flavoring is not so straightforward . 
it s always cool !  and i don t worry about the stainless steel leeching into the water like i would plastic . 
android num_extend is great . if you prefer a phone with a real keyboard ,  you should look into the samsung intercept . 
thinking about buying one of these for home . 
i tried lowering the volume on my phone and radio and neither helped . 
you can fold them up and dump the cut up food right into the pan . 
it also attaches much better to my ear . 
i looked like a professional after using this tip on some cupcakes . 
it s truly massive so make sure you ve got a place to keep it . 
so good for you too . seriously want some right now . 
i recently moved into an apartment that has a ceremic type material sink . 
from the moment i ordered it ,  it only took a couple of days .  .  . i was very satisfied . 
it is quite large even for a normal fridge . 
this is the perfect grind for my french press . 
the same quality was mentioned in a review of the charge  . 
for those interested in better understanding :  my razr phone has a num_num ma battery . 
i noticed people on ebay paying up to $ for this same unit . enjoy !  !  !  . 
it was very easy to adjust the temperature on my gas stove because it is a nice heavy piece . 
i ve paid more for less from so called specialty stores . 
it is a little heavy for my older drawer but i m using it anyway because i really like it . 
i ordered this to replace my original carafe that came with my cuisinart grind and brew coffee maker . 
simple and elegant design ,  works with nearly any decor . 
i use this iron for class ,  home sewing ,  casual ironing ,  piecing ,  etc . 
i love wood handled knives and they are becoming scare . 
if you goof up ,  no problem !  just remove and reapply solution as before and try again . 
you want paper thin tomato slices ?  no problem . 
the tablecloth is good quality and washes and dries nicely . 
from a former $ walmart blender owner i understand why they say  you get what you ppay for .   . 
it is now my favorite pan ,  so i ordered the next size larger to go along with it . 
originally we had only num_num of these ,  which came with a larger set of pyrex . 
keep your quantities reasonable ,  add some oil to cut down on the foaming and you ll be just fine . 
i haven t had any problems as mentioned in some reviews . 
note; checked current prices on colors .  .  . from $ to $ colors are rare ,  it seems .  .  .  . otherwise same coffeepot  !  . 
i have gotten many compliments on it whenever i use it . 
i m throwing out all of my  nonstick  skillets and replacing them with lodge cast iron . 
this food processor is well made and can do a lot of different things . 
works well and seems to have even heat . 
some people have reported excellent toast ,  some massive toast failures . 
i love the added sizes and the sturdy handles . 
pump works perfect with num_num or num_num pumps being just what you need . 
after each cleaning cycle ,  my coffee drinks taste sweet and clear . 
we have one long haired dog and a lab who sheds a lot . 
you can add any word to the dictionary easily as you type . 
cuts well ,  nice length  ,  useful kitchen tool . 
i messed up my first few recipes by over filling the thing . 
i like this humidifier and i like it s price . i like that is has high and low settings . 
i bought this phone case for a friend and she absolutely loves it . 
the quality of the finnish is really good and feels very elegant . 
then ,  i did some more research on the net ,  and other various placces . 
reception is good and it pairs with my num_extend quickly and easily . 
i will be buying more when they go on sale again . 
i will need to order more and just haven t ,  need to do list .  .  . for sure . 
my wife drops her phone constantly ,  and so far ,  so good . 
great price .  . basically got two for the price of one every where i looked of them . 
goat cheese balls to be baked or rolled in herbs or num_extend
despite that action ,  removing that broken glass was not easy . 
because ,  other than using my vacuum to clean my floors ,  i also use it as a bug killer . 
makes a good cup of coffee and does it fast . 
of course ,  you do not have to have a bamboo brush ,  most dish brushes will work . 
it lasts about num_num months comfortably and is easy to use . 
toss one in the glove box for that ,   just in case  moment . 
it feels comfortable when held because of its relatively thin profile . 
i prefer the stainless over aluminum . presto is a good name and it s been around a while . 
for some reason ,  they carried griffin survivor for the ipod ,  but they didn t have this version . 
we didn t want a grinder or any other features that would require repair later on . 
i ve been through quite a few coffee makers ,  but this one is the best yet . 
i have tongs in num_extend num_num and num_num inches ,  with both metal and nylon heads . 
secondly the main part which is the pot is manufactured in us not anywhere else . 
i generally use it when i record videos . 
it is well worth its very reasonable price . 
so simple to get a big bowl of popcorn !  . 
what else do you need in a portable kettle ? okay ,  nothing else as far as i m concerned . 
it would have gone very smoothly had i known the hardware was metric not english . 
the cakes always come out perfect ,  cleans great . 
thank you so much for a great product . 
careful pouring stops those grounds from getting into my mug . 
this one was for my wife ,  as i have a black one . 
that is the only thing that would make it absolutely perfect !  . 
i love the blue lighting that illuminates when it s charging as well . 
i had to drop the cpu in from above to make it work . 
really good ,  so good i bought another one !  . 
i like that the ports are all open . 
i am a relatively new owner of a dyson slim num_extend
this works great for a few people ,  the capacity is just too small for more people . 
i love this pan ,  no cooking spray necessary . 
you seriously have to look to see that there is a protector on there . 
easy to clean or use the top rack of a dishwasher . 
this product is manufactured in china according to the specifications of the us patent . an epicurean bon appetite . 
i was happy to find the endurance stainless steel num_extend conical strainer for $ made in china for rsvp . 
i did ,  but i don t think it was necessary . 
per the apple terms of service ,  this means :  no num_extend party web browser  e . g . 
i like it because if fits on the charger and the phone . 
that requires a bit of trial and error . 
it worked great . the lesson is the quality control is less than good . 
i purchased these for my wife because she likes to listen to audio books a lot . 
way bigger than i expected but they do the job perfectly . 
great look at a great price for a great gal . 
these cost more ,  but are definitely worth the extra money . 
no vacumn bubbles ,  no problem with plunger at all and barely any waste . 
the stainless steel model has many reviewer complaints about rapid rusting . 
i followed the instructions for seasoning this board and it works great . 
a bit more expensive than most ,  but worth every penny . 
yes it sounds strange ,  but i use this to store my nail polish . 
you do not need paper or cloth filters with this product . 
the num_extend gets the job done without attracting undue attention ,  esp . 
shelf looks great and not like some junk you can buy . 
it will disconnect and reconnect to your phone on its own . 
meets all expectations and the cake is yummy . 
even if you screw up five times but get it right the last time ,  it s a great value . 
the headphones look pretty good and seem pretty sharp . 
this blade cuts right through the crust ,  without dragging the toppings the way a pizza wheel will . 
not the highest quality ,  but seriously ,  it s a cutting board . 
i don t think the heat tolerance is that high . 
i would have preferred plain stainless because it cleans faster ,  though these are dishwasher safe . 
this makes the best hot dogs if you aren t cooking on the grill . 
on my samsung battery i get about num_num hours . 
 hello !  air drying ?   it s not easy to replace a carafe  mail order  and it s expensive . 
granted ,  it s not cheap ,  but again ,  being able to charge two things at once is a great  perk  . 
this arrived very quickly and it was exactly as described . 
after i baked the cake i looked around the internet for experiences using a dishwasher for these pans . 
he finds it very useful at just about every meal . 
this was assembled very quickly under num_num minutes  and is extremely sturdy . 
i am purchasing a second as my family is growing and one pizza just isn t enough . 
how do they get those black grill marks on vegetables without using a grill ?  cast iron . 
this is possibly the most convenient item in my kitchen . 
please note that any cellphone that has bluetooth can be set up to use this handset . 
i havent had a problem with grounds getting into my cup . 
i have used the large cutter blade ,  but we prefer the size fries the smaller blade makes . 
because of the sensitivity of the stylus only a very light touch is required on the screen . 
this was a quick purchase ,  since i was on deadline to make dipped chocolate goodies for a party . 
it is light wieght ,  which helps with getting tired hands . 
some other models have holes in the bottom for the water to drain out as you spin . 
i ve also reduced the number of apps i have on the phone . 
even steel cut oats  !  the manual is simple  , yet covers all the bases . 
it is just what i was looking for but had never seen . 
but it did disappoint when it came to using num_extend with a somewhat larger device . 
my daughter needed a phone case she can put on her belt so that she won t lose this phone . 
charges fast and love the usb port on the bottom . 
oh ,  there is an oterbox alternative that you can add on to the case above . 
it is thick and the color has never faded . 
it is a sturdy pan that will last long . 
we solved that problem by feeding the cord through the folded down handle before plugging in . 
i started with lower heat  electric stove  but was still too high . 
since then i permanently attached the small black disk . 
this is a great multi line for drying items outdoors as long as they are not too heavy . 
it works great for us and we are happly with the product . 
there are none better ,  does not spill or leak . 
the best cast iron skillet out there in my opinion . 
our ironing board and iron have been laying around for years . 
i never dump the ingredients into the pan ,  press  start  and leave . 
i haven t tried out the advanced features yet ,  but they look like they could be useful . 
after num_num years with this cooker ,  used probably once a week average it has been great . 
if you have a kitchenaid and a garden ,  you will definitely want to add this attachment to your collection . 
it s not like the description on the website doesn t match the product . 
it pulls air out of the jar and makes a pretty nice seal . 
they seem genuinely concerned with the reputation they hold in the marketplace . 
most cell phones have batteries of around num_extend to num_extend
the spoon is useless for anything but stirring a french espresso in a little cup . 
i can only think of two things that might help . 
about a week after getting mine i cracked a lid taking it off a cold container . 
it does appear to charge my ipad ,  but that wasn t important to me . 
so it s drinkable right away ,  but if you don t drink your mug within about num_num minutes ,  it s cold . 
with this new battery my phone will standby for about num_num days without using it . 
i could use more and may buy them at a later date . 
they work great directly on the grill too . 
i have baked bread each week on them directly ,  on parchment paper and in pans placed on the tile . 
he chops famous coffee shop beans and puts them in reusable pod to brew . 
this pan is not cheap and will not bake your cakes unevenly . 
the clear membrane doesn t affect the responsiveness of the touch screen . 
well today the handle on the lid broke off and i can t find a replacement lid or handle . 
i only wish i could get a second pair with a longer blade . 
the case is comfortable in the hand ,  well designed and sturdy . 
this is a little bigger than you may expect . 
the handle is comfortable and i am able to flatten what i need quickly . 
this wisk is a good fit because it is safe for all types of pans and machine washable . 
other than that ,  works quite well ,  it s been used for about num_num batches of canning and several cooking applications . 
stainless steel is great but i don t make cookies and biscuits everyday so these plastic ones are alright . 
i tried to work the tablet wih fingers alone and found that my fingers are too big . 
while it doesn t have much suction its brush roller does a nice job sweeping dirt into the machine . 
it is very sturdy ,  made out of brushed stainless steel and it matches all of my other appliances . 
use them all the time !  wish the clasp portion was a little easier to use but otherwise they re great . 
my last set lasted about num_num years before i broke them . 
that is why i did all american instead of presto . 
i bought it to use for putting my spices in when i m making corned beef and cabbage . 
this new bowl works so much better than the bowl that came with the mixer . 
also ,  the speaker crapped out after num_num days . 
i use the ac vent clasp and it seems to be universal to most car s air vents . 
before i had an entire cabinet full of spice bottles . 
i have not had any trouble with this oster two slice toaster . 
before i purchased this fryer ,  i read the reviews about it saving oil and how great that was . 
love this product ,  the color and the features . 
i got the optimus and the soleus and much prefer the soleus . 
i have never used a waffle iron before . 
the camera is an num_extend digital camera with a lot of options and effects . 
the other big factor in choosing a steel is length . 
this was proven when she broke the face of her num_extend
i would recommend subscribing to get them every two months for a better price . 
the basket will spin and the water will come out of the salad into the clear bowl . 
these lids were great for storing food in mason type jars . 
it cleans well and you can tell by the dirt and dark colored water deposited in the collection tank . 
my first died after years of heavy use . 
i used it for the first time today  both the frydaddy and this product  . 
this battery pack fit my needs very well . 
would recommend for people wanting to learn how to do this on their own at home without a class . 
when the probe beeped upon reaching the set temp ,  we took the turkey out . 
i have owned this item for at least five years ,  i don t believe that i ve never reviewed it . 
i did my homework and saw that this was highly rated before ordering it . 
this product is so simple yet so genius . 
just ordered both this ,  and a similar pair by nokia . 
it ll always travel with me from now on . 
the bottom takes some pushing to get the flap in to cover the charge port ,  but nothing too strenuous . 
the brita system is easy to use and cheaper than buying bottled water . 
the jawbone does make your voice more intelligible with its noise cancelling abilities . 
a drop or two of dawn in the water helps too . 
it s not thin ,  as some reviews have suggested . 
i bought these shears to go with my shun knives . 
very sturdy and well made ,  looks like it will last forever . 
the part number is num_extend and it s made in korea . 
after num_num years of working fine  has its moods  ,  it stopped sucking the dirty water yesterday . 
bought this over a year ago and i would be lost without it . 
so i need to play around with that one alittle bit . 
i need these little things for my jump drive . 
makes baking a lot easier with precut parchment paper . 
i had been waiting for almost a month after ordering it from another online store . 
i bought this pan to avoid the initial seasoning process . 
other than that the product is excellent and well worth the money . 
use pot holders to remove anything from a microwave . 
just crack the egg in it ,  the yolk stays in ,  while the egg white runs out the nose holes . 
a friend of mine gave me four of these ,  and i loved them enough to want to buy more . 
just wish that it lasted longer and that is helped more with the children then with my boyfriend . 
you can literally see and hear the heat transfer in a nice ,  solid sizzle . 
i cut it a bit smaller than the actual cutting board and it looks great on my counter . 
it s comfortable in my hand and the rubbery handle is grippy ,  even when wet . 
with a phone cover on ,  however ,  the edges of the screen protector have been peeling off . 
this machine is small and functional ,  very fast and easy to use . 
we eat a lot of salads ,  and very much enjoy the peppermill . 
my advice to bonjour :  ditch the plastic spoon altogether or offer a frother with a stainless steel spoon . 
i have purchased one for all of my family and friends . 
it is not completely waterproof ,  so be careful whereyou use it . 
but i have not had it long ,  i will post again when i have more info on longevity . 
i have no complaints and i strongly suspect that neither will you . enjoy this delightful knife . 
that will tell you how quickly it adjusts and how accurate it is . 
it still creates ozone and we re still not sure how the plasma ions will effect our health long term . 
overall it seems to be a good product ,  but i d really like to know the specs on each port . 
i use this product to flavor large quantities of sauce . 
the price is exceptional for the quality provided !  !  !  . 
have num_num sets of spoons now so i don t have to rinse off between ingredients . 
but this week we came back around and ordered this grinder . 
but the really cheap ones don t last ,  and may not really work at all . 
these fiesta iems are hands down the best we have owned in fifteen years of marriage . 
awesome machine but i don t use it anymore . 
i had another oxon can opener but i found it hard to grip tightly enough to use . 
i have used pyrex casserole dishes for many years ,  but did not have the num_num qt . 
the only reason is because the inside is more protected . 
and cuts down on cleaning afterwards . there is smoke . 
it s nice buying something and having it last longer than you anticipated . 
this size fits perfectly in my yogurt maker instead of using the little jars . 
i m going to have to try the aerolatte this time . 
then ,  i go back to just the iphone battery . there are three big issues that i num_extend
not cool !  !  !  i bought the phone for that !  the phone is great and flawless otherwise . 
also perfect gift for the bakers in your life . 
yes ,  it s good at what it does :  scraping . 
same high quality battery that came with my phone . 
it does make your phone a little bit more bulky but i don t mind it . 
he can wear it on his hip or put it in his pocket . 
like the iphone num_num the otterbox defender iphone num_num case shares the same aesthetic lines . 
especially ,  i like the stainless steel carafe that won t break into bits if i drop it . 
either way ,  this shouldn t discourage you from purchasing an amazing coffee maker . 
so i kept on saying out loud  call x  .  .  . no avail . 
in the oven it works as a temperature sink ,  stabilizing the temp beautifully for baking . 
nevertheless ,  it is light for an num_extend knife and i m fine with this . 
the hoover is much more effective on the hardwoods as well as the ceramics and vinyls . 
i have also made the whole wheat and multi grain bread . i heartily recommend this panasonic bread machine . 
they would complain that got tired of their earphones falling out when working out . 
the first time i used it to make cheese crackers in the microwave oven . 
couldn t be happier .  .  . best $ i ve spent in a long time . 
just put a few pieces in and roll on the counter then boom a perfect piece of clean garlic . 
but for less than $ with shipping ,  i highly recommend this case . 
crispy skin ,  moist meat . easy to clean and store ,  reasonably priced ,  i am a satisfied customer !  . 
i plan to buy a few more ,  and to keep baking yummy homemade cookies . 
one small disadvantage is i leave it in my sink all the time . 
i ve even put mine in the dishwasher on numerous occasions and it still looks great !  . 
i have used these earbuds for num_num months now and they have exceeded my expectations . 
this prevents the screen from being scratched if you lay it on the table . 
everyone who has opened that drawer is very impressed with this tray . 
the first one we received had a cracked handle and the lid wouldn t fit properly ,  probably damaged in shipping . 
powerful motor and the finer the grind the longer you do it . 
these are fantastic bowls ,  great for everything but we especially like them for soup and cereal . 
if you like the calphalon commercial hard anodized line ,  add this to your collection before they run out !  . 
the rubber ring on the bottom keeps the dispenser stable . 
i love this steamer because it fits in all clad sauce pans from num_num to num_num quarts . 
see other reviews for other complaints . what puts this machine in perspective is the delonghi equivalent coffemaker my office purchased . 
bought a second one and the coffee drinker in the house loves it . 
protects the edges of the phone without bulk . 
i guess it could swing out further from the machine ,  but it is really powerful . 
this new eureka is replacing an upright that i bought in the early num_extend
this oxo provides a deeper spoon than most other stainless steel products ,  and has a nice length . 
but this num_extend cuisnart is a really nice num_extend place . 
went into a small bathroom and ran a hot shower for a few minutes . 
they are sturdy ,  the lids seal tightly ,  and have a nice quality feel about them . 
first ,  the large ,  rubber like handle gives you great gripping power to dig into hard ice cream . 
so far i have ordered two of these !  . 
replaced older cookware with this set and find the new set is easy to use and performs well . 
arrived on time and i tried it instantly !  works like a charm and has clean audio in the headset . 
it nice and small but it not to small or to big . 
overall ,  i m impressed with the unit for ease of use as well as ease of interface . 
the only problem is that this hinge doesn t have much  if any  tension on it . 
like the way this is made so they seem to pour out better . 
it is easy enough for her to handle . 
of course i did have the carpets shampooed also . 
if you run very hot water over the design .  .  . it kinda just melts off . 
when i am doing anything very active ,  i use the belt loops and the clip . 
there is the plastic outer chamber ,  the mesh inner basket ,  and the top . 
i store the machine in a cupboard ,  so i must move it each time it s used . 
this extra feature makes it easy to achieve the perfect peeling job with minimal effort . 
i have an num_extend cast iron that was my grandmas and is over num_num years old . 
it makes your ipod look like an iphone num_extend
there are a few things that might be num_extend
i think this machine provides good value for the money spent . 
can t say enough good things about these little covers . 
i ve tried the flash feature ,  and it helps a tiny bit  but i would never use it again . 
i have experienced so dropped calls ,  but not sure if it s my phone or the headphone . 
it is well made and is great for smaller tasks like whipping eggs for omelets . 
the amounts dont have to be exact like some other reveiwers said . 
i can t say enough good things about dutch ovens . 
i picked this up in the purple color and it is a perfect for the ipod touch num_extend gen  . 
i ve tried others ,  but this is the best i ve found . 
ive dropped it down the concrete stairs at work several times ,  my phone is still % damaged . 
i don t even use it that much and i still found room for it in my tiny kitchen . 
great way to organize your cables by training them to the baseboard . 
no more hitting buttons with my cheek ,  which is always nice !  . 
they have excellent customer service and i was very ,  very satisfied with them and their product . 
i would make them both have a micro usb slot for the chargers . 
most common mix is frozen banana in skim milk and diet powder or fruit . 
i only used it once ,  and it worked fine . 
they have a shiny sheen to them which gives a more formal look toyour counter tops . 
mind you ,  it s not perfect ,  but the sound is reasonably good . 
i have the plain one that doesn t have wheels . 
the oven doors where all messed up and do not seal . 
then there s the cost of replacement heads on a regular basis . 
all the right holes are still there  camera ,  mic  . 
none have the ideal weight balance that the chopstakes do . 
however ,  as a result they don t break in the dishwasher . 
love the extra depth in this selection i purchased . 
when these finally arrived i was surprised at how much more quickly the water went through the filter . 
makes such a difference and i actually looking forward to having cold days now . 
short and simple :  the battery works fine in my htc phone . 
easy enough to clean which i did by hand ,  it does say it s dishwasher safe as well though . 
they are a great ,  sturdy dish with nice deep bowls . 
keep  em charged and ready !  works as promised . 
it s attractive ,  seems to hold a reasonable amount of weight and the hooks can be moved around . 
i bought num_num of these for the different colors to fit my mood . 
i installed this rack outside on my stainless steel work table for bbqing . 
quality and really sticks !  !  this works great for my iphone . 
we use these torches in our home for cooking and in our our small business where we teach crafts . 
this is great if you need to stay in a hotel . 
good solid tenderizer ,  it has some weight to it  be sure not to drop it on your toes  . 
they look more homemade and fit on a plate better . 
cleans quickly and provides the protection we need for the bottom of the oven . 
if you need a scale ,  buy this one . 
i like the rubberized material the case is made of that keeps it from slipping off slippery surfaces . 
otherwise ,  it is a great little piece of equipment . 
when we have guests ,  they love that colorful pile of plates displayed on the buffet . 
i was always moving it around and it was getting in my way . 
i ve owned nearly every plantronics headset made to date . 
lovely looking screen ,  and it hides a multitude inside our front door  :   . 
been using this as a backup for a month and it works great so far . 
buy it and all the accessories .  . you will love it . 
on my end ,  the volume is more than adequate . 
the handles are a bit awkward ,  but only in comparison to my first butter slicer . 
the measuring cup that fits inside the food chute is handly and convenient . 
this was far and away the best price . 
the future will tell us how long they will live . 
inserting my belt was a bit difficult but it should ease up over time . 
i tried several others but sent everyone of them back on day num_extend this one is a keeper . 
the previous was teflon and is very old and not as good as this stock pot . 
i find it cumbersome at times due to its size .  .  .  .  .  . especially in the evening before i retire for the night . 
would like to have this in other colors ,  so i can change out off and on . 
these picks are really good for anything ,  they are sharp enough for cheese too . 
i purchased another cusinart howevetr it was smaller . 
still testing to see if it pops off . 
well ,  i cook quite a bit and had always wanted a kitchenaid stand mixer . 
this has functioned well in hot pots  jelly s and soups  to cold applications  smoothies and shakes  . 
got this headset for my self it s a cool and useful device . 
the fork itself is nice and sturdy ,  a good size ,  and handles well . 
now it works great it s limited to about num_extend feet on line of site and num_num through walls . 
they do a wonderful job ,  grinding with ease . 
made my pizza and this pan was great . 
no reason to think we won t have this one as long as the last one . 
this fiestaware pitcher is beautiful and perfect for cream for one . 
very happy that i switched and purchased this product . 
i also like that it brews such a large amount in a short time . 
i also got some bormioli duos latte mugs somewhere in there too ,  which were also great . 
if i ever do this again ,  i might actually use super glue instead of the adhesive sticker things . 
multiple flow levels and direction allows greater seasonal use . 
i have all num_num and would definitely buy again . 
this pair is not a bad looking set of ears . 
i wish i would have known this before i bought it . 
the bowl was fine ,  while he was eating . 
pros :  the fit on this case is very snug  see cons  . 
we hang them on a hook and don t have to wash them for num_num weeks . 
i have a white iphone and when i put the case on the little s shaped design wasn t apparent . 
i mention this because when i used it in nyc a setting of num_num worked great for toast . 
the water stays hot for about an hour and stays warm for num_num or more hours . 
not sure of the  model  but they re called  ice hardened  . 
the kitchen aide gma grain mill proved to be a fantastic grinder at a very affordable price . 
fitsvery easily in my jeans or shorts ,  offers excellent protection ,  and the price is unbeatable !  . 
anyway ,  i love them ,  won t use anything else in the house now . 
but they should be checked now and then . 
this is the nicest cellphone headset i have owned . 
i ve been yearning for this particular piece in lemongrass to add to my fiestaware collection . 
plastic only bends so many times before breaking . 
the screen is dim  everyone notices this  and it is hard to see in sunlight . 
it works !  i just don t care for the high gloss black .  .  . i would prefer a flat black . 
i try to limit myself to one or maybe num_num cups per day . 
my old bowl hit the floor and made a dent ,  so needed a replacement . 
they are easier to use once the attachment that holds them all together is removed . 
and like other reviewers have written ,  having separate parts makes cleaning very easy . 
this is stylish and out of the way ,  yet the hooks are plenty sturdy for wet towel . 
finally i bought it at $ per set . 
i have num_num utensils in it right now and there is room for more . 
they are sending  factory service  out to me tomorrow . 
mine lasted me for quite a while before wearing out . 
everyone has a hard time not eating too many once they eat one . 
i m just a housewife who hates ironing and i needed to vent today . 
i don t peel the garlic clove ,  just pop it in and squeeze . 
since then ,  i ve been using it to make brownies ,  and i love it . 
the rollers ,  of course ,  are fixed ,  and thus don t allow for varying thicknesses . 
good value for the price ,  contains num_num sheets . 
takes all the scratches my screen would be getting which i really bought it for . 
i also think it feels good to hold in my hand !  !  !  . 
this piece is exactly the same just a lot less price . 
we have been using it daily now for a few months ,  and we are very ,  very happy with it . 
i bought a real henckels chefs knife and a real bread knife . 
it won t work . the free videotape is very well presented and helpful . 
i suppose it came from the east somewhere . 
i expected it to be ,  much like other wireless device accessories ,  junk . 
fairly heavy and well made ,  makes a good appearance ,  and is very functional . 
have had the stylus several weeks and the stylus tip seems to be holding up very well . 
this little battery pack is great if you have an iphone . 
wish they had a handle ,  but oh well . 
replace the same model which we had used continuously for num_num years . 
it feels solid and i completely forget that i have it on . 
these are well made and look and perform great . 
so unless you have a means of charging in the car ,  a roadtrip might not be very ideal . 
we have been using this coffee maker since it arrived a week ago . 
i was quite impressed . okay ,  now that you ve juiced to your heart s content ,  it s time to clean . 
i have the artisan num_num quart model and it fits over it perfectly . 
i use it everyday and it stays sharp ,  unlike the others i own . 
no discoloration ,  and no leaking from bottom edge . looked long and hard before opting on this teakettle . 
inexpensive insurance for all the food in your refrigerator . 
i then rub the bird with the rub of my choice . 
this spatula is really nice ,  but a little smaller in length than my other ones . 
at around a dollar ,  i will pick up a few if i need them . 
didn t effect the over all functions of the phone . 
it is a nice size for serving meat . 
once you ve tasted your first scoop you ll be addicted . 
this is what i wanted and got all tools to go with it . 
now she can put her new victorino knife in the drawer without the danger of cutting herself . 
as a vegan ,  i work with a lot of vegetables . 
the grinder works well and produces a fairly uniform grind that is easily adjustable . 
it was a great toaster and if you averaged it out it cost about $ a year to own . 
it takes a good amount of pressure to squeeze the handles to work effectively . 
when you first turn it on ,  it grabs the floor immediatly with lots of suction . 
but that s for another review . with batteries ,  as with other electronics ,  don t go cheap . 
the phone did stop responding when trying to accomplish several tasks quickly . 
if you are cooking for one or two , this is the perfect size pan . 
i was surprised at how frothy i can get whole ,  % and even skim milk with this little product . 
it s easy to position ,  cuts well ,  no sharp edges . 
i was just a little surprised by how short it is . 
their competitor brand is equally good only num_num feet shorter . 
the long handle stays cool to the touch . 
for me  and what i eat  ,  it works . 
nice improvement over the voyager num_num as far as size and ear clip is concerned . 
i just got this in the mail a couple days ago . 
i m impressed with how much better the coffee turns out over paper filters . 
i have several of these now for different knife sizes . 
hate that i had to wait num_num weeks however . 
for the quality of these batteries ,  the price is amazing . 
it also helps my lactose intolerant husband keep his stomach in good running order . 
this is a great fan ,  once you figure out how to put it together . 
durable and in three different colors to match case . 
and the oven safe aspect of pyrex ,  as well as microwave and dishwasher compatability is a real bonus . 
no need to disconnect earbuds for phone num_extend
never thought making espressos or cappuccinos can be so easy . 
the small food processing container is just the right size for num_num or num_num people . 
it is the perfect size for my num_num cups of coffee in the morning . 
this case is amazing ,  it is the best thing that can ever happen to an iphone user . 
this was the most comfortable armband i ve owned for a large smartphone . 
i have a full beard and ever have a problem with this headset . 
i loved this scoop !  love the grip on it as it was easy to hold . 
if you are clumsy like me with phones than this is the phone case for you . 
ordinarily would never pay this price for a table fan but happy i did . hunter quality sure does tell . 
great grinder ,  quieter than our previous one ,  and truly gives you a fine grind for espressos . 
fit perfectly into the phone and hold charge pretty good . 
it arrived and looked and assembled just like the picture which made me very happy . 
also ,  i ve dropped my phone plenty of times and the commuter case hasn t let me down . 
i somewhat agree ,  as it is hard to remove smudges from it . 
the wet paper towel works like a charm . 
i have found that i am rarely happy with prepackaged sets of anything . 
it s not as long as you ideally need but it s very cheap !  . 
let me know if you find better roasts ,  blends ,  combinations . 
can fit several batteries and has rubber feet to stay on the table . 
this pan is exactly what i was looking for . 
the touchscreen works very well with the included styli though . 
now i make curried tuna ,  among other things ,  in this baby . 
it fits my range well and the handle makes it easy to mange . 
because i think this is important ,  my battery shipped from the oem planet . 
this looks acceptable and functions well based on my initial uses . 
buy two and it s free shipping which is awesome . 
i have a few other stainless steel mixing bowls that are not from fox run . 
i would recommend this if you have a large smartphone with or without an extended battery . 
i m going with tried and true motorola on this one . 
does what i had expected it would do . 
i was looking for a jar to brew kombucha . 
plus ,  it was never easy for me to disengage the one bowl from the other . 
they re chic when you want to just take it to an event or that of the like . 
it s a good one and i miss mine . 
however ,  for my use ,  and for the price ,  this thing works great . 
unless you re a snob ,  you re not a horrible snob are you ?  . 
get a cheap plastic whipping siphon and whip cream away . 
it doesn t pick up excessive amounts of background noise . 
and i d get the little lid too ,  when you order it . 
it ll last longer that way . you want to use real popcorn salt ,  for examplepopcorn salt . 
i have been cooking with revere ware since i was a kid . 
the second one is just as clear as the first but this one will not stream music . 
the rollers make it very easy to open and close the curtain . 
i had order the top piece and thought i had to order the cable piece separate . 
good volume ,  clear speaking and hearing ability when talking on the phone . 
no matter how hard i try it still has ton of bubble . 
all in all i do recommend this case just for the simple fact of its cost and look . 
ehh .  .  . my family goes through glasses like no other . 
the mda used to be a real guy magnet . 
the dough can sit to one side of pan . 
i do not experience issues with the devices sliding down . 
this one i purchased to send to my son along with an electric pressure cooker . 
drop the water into a french press containing coarse grounds ,  and four minutes later you have excellent coffee . 
have had this khun rikon epicurean garlic press for several years . 
i can t wait to add to my collection . 
season it regularly ,  clean it with water  no soap  and a cast iron scrubber ,  and keep it oiled . 
i highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good holster . 
i love this case ,  it doesn t make the phone much larger . 
i then pop the butter keeper in the dishwasher before changing to a new stick . 
you need a charger every where you go . 
but the material is excellent ,  it is leather . 
you can add num_extend and that will call your voicemail . 
purchased these for my bluair num_num after my normal internet search and these were the least expensive out there . 
use this with any usb charger to charge your phone ,  it s much cheaper than the bulky charger option . 
it works jsut as fast and does not get the motor hot . 
i know there are more expensive grinders and i know that there are different types of grinders . 
i finally shelled out some cash for a case and it was absolutely worth it . 
it appears that the rack willhold up well and offer the customer a quality product . 
i use the whipper to make cookies and beat eggs . 
still be soft ,  but the ice crystal structure is intact and stable . 
glad we purchased it; great friend to our bread machine . 
there is a hole in the back for a charging cable to come through and plug into your phone . 
it s a high quality product that makes a delicious cup of coffee . 
it is veryefficient for its stated pupose and is of quality materials . 
typical screen savers with time they scratch and fade ,  but for the price its supposes to do that . 
this case is really cute and brightly colored . 
brand new product and this works great for my phone . 
works great ,  why didn t i think of getting this sooner . 
i kept smelling burning plastic ,  but figured mom had dropped something in the oven that i couldn t find . 
the bowls are excellent for mixing in and very easy to keep clean because they are glass . 
we are not coffee snobs in our house ,  but we do hate the minor irritations of cheap coffee makers . 
i ll try and keep my review short and simple . 
i got this coffeemaker about a year ago and am quite pleased with it . 
i ordered this because it is small ,  handy to use ,  and easy to clean . 
this isn t my first ice tong ,  but i believe it may be my last . 
i did augment this set with some extra goodies straight from both amazon and from the manufacturer . 
it makes it quickly and nothing is wasted . 
it is a clean design and not too heavy . 
they are also the perfect sizes as prepping bowls for garlic ,  herbs ,  spices ,  and whatnot . 
i have used this style of osterizer for years ,  until finally my old one gave up the ghost . 
i purchased the panini press and lid also so all in all this is very versatile . 
it works as well as it did the day i bought it . 
i picked up this headset to use as an inexpensive wired hands free solution for my iphone num_extend
recently made almond butter for the first time and don t think i ll ever buy any prepared nut butter again . 
they thought it was real cool and so do i . 
this fills up the cupboard and some pots have been relegated to the shelves in the garage . 
not thinking i would use it for a long time i charged it and threw it in a drawer . 
i have since bought one for my daughter as well . 
initially ,  it can be difficult to mount it on a can . 
i wouldn t recommend this if you go through a lot of water; i have the bigger pitchers for that . 
i ve owned several brands of matte iphone and ipad screen protectors ,  including a zagg which developed a plaid texture . 
i opted to use solid colored dark green napkins and the combo was great . 
that said it works well and pairing was easy after getting the light to turn purple . 
con it can be a little bigger . easy to use . 
i just wish i didnt have to pull it into a power source . 
it s such a convenient size ,  you can use it for so many things . 
if you use the pan on a fire ,  you can get soot on the exterior . 
this is a basic ,  no frills model but it seemed to do the job very nicely . 
they are stuck on there ! i am pleased with this purchase . 
at this price you simply cannot beat it . 
you can do loads of cooking tasks easily with this . 
nonetheless ,  the difference between the filters we were running and this one was the difference between night and day . 
i also wanted one that lets me adjust the doneness . 
didn t rip and i used it for over a year . 
for the price ,  it is a great product . 
my first one broke after a few months . 
for less than $ you can t be the price and quality of the batteries . 
you can talk and charge at the same time . 
first coffee machine i have owned which use these and at first i was skeptical . 
i had seen these in stores and thought it would be another unused item to clutter the kitchen . 
if it does i ll bump this to a num_extend
i just love it !  now the fridge looks nice and tidy . 
these percs are fast and pretty and classic . 
i have tried scratching them and they appear that they will hold up . 
i make these chocolate ricotta fritters  homemade ricotta ,  lemon ,  cocoa ,  flour ,  eggs ,  sugar . 
i had this for num_extend years and it still works . 
just make sure you use a sharp serrated bread knife when slicing home made bread . 
the glasses have survived several washings in our dishwasher . 
we had a cheapknock off pair of these originally and the oxos are made of much heaviergauge stainless steel . 
since my cell phone uses alot of juice this was my first replacement that i purchased . 
this really worked well on the water staines i had on my marble table . 
super simple ,  rough it in with the steel side and fine tune it with the ceramic side . 
this press is very precise and just works beautifully . 
so we thought we would try it out ,  glad we did . 
my wife wanted this to make a recipe box for our daughter . 
i didn t noticed much of a difference between this one and the wacom bamboo stylus that costs $ dollars . 
i bought this to use with my hand held vacuum sealer and have been very happy with it . 
to program the timer ,  you always just press eight buttons ,  which can be accomplished in just a few seconds . 
it is so loud that your ears will be ringing for an hour afterward . 
the charger keeps the phone fully charged so it works nicely as a gps unit while driving . 
if you read some of the reviews and are a little iffy about it ,  just go for it . 
the sound quality is great ,  it pairs and maintains connection with no hassle at all . 
we found it at the mall for $
and now that verizon owns alltel ,  there is even better cdma coverage all around ,  especially where i am . 
when you press the start button ,  you d hear a cute melody that lets you know the cooking is started . 
these heavy pans then go through an enameling process before being shipped . 
these have nice smooth action and sharp blades . 
i bought a number of these spoon rests after discovering how expensive they were in my city . 
what a pleasure to cook with this little skillet . 
the trays are made of very durable plastic that feels substantial and rugged ,  but isn t too heavy . 
for less than a dollar ,  this is a steal . 
i used the num_extend on a creative vision with these headphones as well . 
the vinyl coating on my old one split at the tip . 
surprisingly ,  many people don t care for marinated peeps . 
i love the beauty of the blade and the dark ,  polished ,  pakkawood handle . 
i ve grilled meat ,  vegetables ,  and sandwiches in mine . 
the only drawback was the grill plates could not be removed to facilitate eassier cleanups . 
it is not all my spices size ,  but that s exactly what i wanted . 
this thing is tough and easy to use and i love it . 
they still feel as if you are touching the extraordinary makes of the iphone . 
the mechanism is the same as original but the handle has been changed over the years . 
this was the twelfth month ,  and the last ,  before nancy would leave . 
there are num_num slots for credit cards and even a window slot for an i . d . 
irobot offers a $ credit to an upgraded model ,  but it was still cheaper to buy on hsn . 
the pulp on this one comes out a bit wet . 
expensive ,  but likely the last garlic press you ll ever need to buy . 
this headset is awesome best i ve had ,  will purchase another for my wife soon . 
the included micro usb cord is the same one as came with the phone . get this one . 
for the price though ,  i really can t complain . 
upgrades the kitchen as well as the whole cooking experience . 
this brand makes their products safely ,  so i decided to switch . 
the product is just something that is hard to enthuse about but i would certainly buy it again . 
for me ,  this bowl is the perfect size for salad ,  a small pasta dish or vegetables . 
the sparkle is silver  . it looks perfect with white iphone . 
they are identical to the originals purchased at the local supermarket  they no longer carry them  . 
i use another ,  with mesh screen ,  for flour . 
i make a considerable amount of home made soap for gifts to friends and relatives . 
awesome case !  very handy and useful for the iphone . it resist a fall and fits in perfectly . 
although it doesn t come with instructions ,  it was very easy to put together . 
i gave the snails and plant a couple of days to settle in . 
perfect for soups ,  rice ,  stews ,  and large quantity meals . 
exactly what i needed for my popcorn popper . 
i have owned the iphone num_extend and now the iphone num_extend
this waffle iron looks exactly like the g . e . 
it is effective for that purpose and does seem to keep a room cooler . 
bought this battery from acc ,  and it arrived exactly as described . 
plastic bowls seem fine ,  except for the occasionally extremely hot unpopped kernel ,  which could hypothetically be a problem . 
compliments all the other shapes that we have at the moment . 
seems very sturdily made and have had absolutley no problems . 
i am not sure how well getting shorthand read back sounds . 
i know that some have complained that it was too lose but mine had a very snug fit . 
it is easily scratched and does not return to a flat surface despite what the manufacturer claims . 
 other users pointed out that the charger does charge the ipad . 
used smart balance oil since and never have a problem ,  but this is my opinion . 
i would have preferred it be smaller and round . 
i had many unfortunate experiences with coffee makers  ranging from mr . 
i was afraid the quality of plastic was going to be lacking but it s actually very good quality . 
it took less than one week for me to find ideal settings for my microwave . 
it is easy to clean and the buzzer is hard to miss when the time is finish . 
i bought this to hold my phone upright on my desk while i am at work . 
this was bought for my son as a gift and he absolutely loves it . 
you can push it forward and pull backward ,  unlike the typical rental units . 
i am very protective of my iphone and take very good care of it . 
cover didn t enlarge the bulkiness of the phone as much as i feared it might . 
they only turn them on in the morning when they get out of bed . 
sheesh ! update :  our num_num qt kuhn rikon ,  model num_num arrived . 
we have used these cuisinart skillets for years . 
since we ve had it ,  we ve upgraded our cell phones . 
most awesome ,  versatile ,  pressure cooker i ever owned . 
the hepa filter is given num_num years of life till needs replacing . 
took this camping and it performed amazing best chicken ever . 
the mount also has foam protectors on each arm piece so it won t damage the phone . 
i have a full beard ,  and i have never had any discomfort at all . 
i loved this coffee maker from the moment it popped up in my search . 
this dryer was easy to set up without concrete and can be relocated . 
the wallet is good quality and looks like it will provide good protection . 
so far so good with this coffee pot . 
my phone works and stays on longer because of this battery . 
the packaging is beautiful and so is the product . now the downside . 
using this handset in combination with a microcell produces absolutely stellar voice quality . 
maybe it was working too hard ,  although it didn t seem to be the motor that was the issue . 
it should go in one and erupt from the other . 
the price was the greatest thing about it . 
the only complaint i have is that the inner layer attracts dust but other than that ,  perfect . 
they are very durable and easy to open . 
tape eventually wears off  esp since we remove it when we use the tv  . 
tomatoes are the best ,  perfect for making fresh sauces . 
i liked being able to tell people it does more than just function as a back up power source . 
i haven t checked this post in a while now but i noticed there were some questions about sync speed . 
it s sleek ,  and it holds a lot of alcohol . 
its hard so dont worry about it sticking in your pocket . 
as for the issues people mentioned with applying it ,  i had none . 
so i came across these by complete accident ,  read the reviews ,  and immediately ordered a pair for myself . 
for the price and the fact that it is oem ,  highly recommended . 
i found this much easier to clean after use than my royal . 
if it was possible i would give it num_extend stars . 
however ,  i appreciate good tools and this looked like just such a thing . 
if you are looking for stainless steel this is the one . 
also easy to acccess and grab the knives . 
can t remember what happened to the previous ones ,  but they typically last a few years . 
this will last a long time and continue to perform very well . 
easy to use and clean up was ok . 
i really like this measuring cup ,  it is solid feeling yet light weight . 
the bowl attaches to the motor like my old model . 
anyways ,  these are the best containers you ll ever own . 
the rack installed easy and does a great job of holding pots ,  pans and lids . 
i ve had this filter for over a year . 
these just feel good in the hand and do a wonderful job . 
it effectively extends the usage time for the samsung galaxy s num_extend
i ve never had a problem with the sticks and we use this mold constantly . 
i am saving money and also the environment . 
the only drawback is the separate piece that is supposed to assist with cleaning . 
and i eat a lot of fresh ginger and this makes grating ginger a breeze . 
works as expected ,  it is a usb charger ,  either it works as expected or not . nothing else valuable to add . 
i already have a wilton pan ,  and i ve always liked the quality .  .  .  . this one didn t let me down . 
it came out perfect !  my husband was shocked . 
now i have straight knives again and everyone is happy ,  munching their oysters . 
we love it . it makes our porch look great . 
this seems like a feature everybody would want . 
seems to stay sharp for a long time . 
very clean looking and i never worry about breaking them . 
i waited until this one was in stock and ordered antoher right away . 
granted you will likely just blow out part of your gasket  the safety measure  if you get distracted . 
it is num_extend but it was too bulky too carry around without a backpack . 
i bought a  used like new  one from an amazon marketplace dealer and it works fine . 
it also comes with a usb car socket charger which is nice . the physical design of the device is nice . 
we bought two of these ,  one for a small compact car ,  and one for a large van . 
i had purchased several stylus pen from a different seller and they were not as good and these . 
i was hoping this would have the hole for the front camera and it did . 
my mother grows her own veggies and loves to can them . 
the wires don t criss cross at the tip and that makes it easy to clean . 
it is small and take up little space on my counter . 
i try to avoid being in close proximity to magnets and easily popped it off the back . 
pros :  works on iphone num_num and other usb chargeable devices without need for special cables or tips . 
i expected it to be louder with deeper bass . 
it s not particularly great in any single area ,  but it s a solid headset with nice features . 
they love it and enjoy watching the pizza cook which they could not do with a traditional oven . 
secondly ,  there should have been noise reduction feature . 
i have literally zero complaints about it ,  and absolutely love it . 
i gave it num_num stars because of cleaning and since the stuff don t stay as hot as everyone says . 
i followed the reviews and bought this little wonder tool . 
the non stick surface cleans easily so hand washing is not a problem . 
be sure and follow directions on cleaning and storage . 
you have several different options as to how you can wear the headset . 
if it is as durable as it looks i ll be very happy with this product . 
putting the iphone to charge is also very easy and they have given adapters for num_extend and num_extend
wasn t possible or maybe i don t know how . 
push the pastry up the sides and form a nice edge with your thumb and finger . 
this tamper feels very solid in the hands and has a good heft to it . 
once it s on your phone ,  it is secured into place . 
it is good as a skillet ,  griddle and pizza pan . 
however ,  in most other environments i have used it ,  it continues to look and work great . 
i think it s when alerts come to the phone . 
pictures taken with the num_extend camera look fantastic with adequate lighting ,  but otherwise were dull with an overcast tone . 
i ve used this coffee grinder for three months . 
now i and watch my information in piece ,  without some one looking up my informationthank you for the product . 
i ve bought similar before and had the section cup break on one . 
since buying the disposable bags i ve used my tips a lot more . 
warm water , some dish washing soap dawn ?    , and a sponge or kitchen dish cloth . 
my patton fans are num_num and num_num years old . 
delivered quickly and nice product love it was a back up case using as primary for now love it . 
this is the same granite ware roaster that s been used for generations . 
since one reviewer actually didn t understand what this meant ,  i will explain it for others . 
i just wish i had bought this a long time ago . 
i ve been using these for years and highly recommend them . 
but my main concern is the the numbers are printed on the rubber handles . 
it is beautifully engineered ,  high quality ,  and worth every penny . 
they are the best i have ever bought . 
always looking for a rubber spatula only find my wifes tiny kitchen toys for housewives . 
she loves the fact that you can see the apple throught the back of the case . 
not only does it look good ,  but the chain means i know it won t fall off . 
we got ours last night and got down to business . 
it is made to protect the original phone screen from scratches and other damage . 
i didn t even know that braun made electric water kettles until finding this model here on amazon . 
bought this for sepatating homemade gravy ,  i haven t used it yet . 
she loves it and may even be using it as i write this . 
i am accenting my kitchen in red so i ordered these shakers . 
fortunately ,  cuisinart has redesigned the grind and brew to make these jobs very easy . 
this model is sturdy and easy to clean . 
i am pleased with this purchase and would recommend . 
it is more dollars than some but i think you get your money s worth . 
the popcorn feature on the microwave does not really work that well . 
it s such a model of efficiency ,  ingenuity of design and i like the style of it as well . 
still very happy with the batteries and charger . 
the trick is to push it firmly so it is wedged in tight when you go to twist . 
we just chose a num_extend amp for the front to handle tablets on our annual trip . 
the screen is not difficult to clean ,  just use the brush provided . 
for onions ,  bell pepper ,  tomato ,  garlic ,  it s perfect . 
call me old fashioned  :  i would have given my old unit num_num stars  quiet ,  effective and efficient  . 
this pressure cooker is probably the best on the market and a perfect size for a family . 
i ordered a second pair as a backup . 
if you have weak hands or wrists ,  you might be better off with the lighter glass carafe . 
the meal is the highlight ,  not fussy plate colors or artwork scrolled across the face . 
this app allows different features for the handset . 
for the longest time i was much happier with a cheap wired version . 
folded for your convenience ,  these are chlorine free ,  without the paper taste other brands have . 
makes a cup of coffee like the very first i ever had ,  in a word ,  reliable . 
don t put too much stock in reviews that tell stories of a blue light menace . 
spring and fall cleaning will be the only time more than likely . 
it draws about num_extend which is pretty heavy ,  but for cooling down the hexayurt ,  nothing compares . 
i ve not had this ear piece come off one time . 
if you like yellow ,  i think you will also like this . 
it doesn t get heavy use but looks real nice on the kitchen counter . 
she likes to make kettle popcorn with different flavors . 
i have tried about num_num different ones and none of them work as well as this one . 
the same could be said for the other two smaller ones . 
i am very happy with this product and i highly recommend it . 
no sound even when it was turned up all the way . 
paired it with my phone in all of num_num seconds and i haven t looked back yet . 
few days later i got a new one ,  without asking . 
for whatever reason ,  we have not been able to get it to properly work one her iphone num_extend
you ll get use to the size in no time . 
i actually didn t purchase this bread machine ,  i received mine for free through a freecycle group . 
a little gurgly at the brew end ,  but i actually enjoy that . 
i bought black because of the deal but i m definitely going to buy another color . 
presto num_num frydaddy electric deep fryerbought for my daughter and she loves it . 
it didn t hurt that it was $ off . 
it only holds enough food to serve one or two num_extend
it looks like it will last a lifetime . 
had this thing for a few months now . it looks really great on the counter and it toasts very well . 
still ,  we liked the grinder well enough to order another one . 
it is not bad quality at all ,  which is expected from cases that are this inexpensive . 
my other gripe is the design of the cradle . 
the only complaint is that it is difficult to clamp onto a counter . 
i wish that there was a pack of the cafe blue without the mugs . 
i bought the blueant num_extend at the local electronics superstore in case i wanted to return it afterwards . 
seriously ,  they make for a simple prep and super fast cleanup . 
all this power and convenience weighs a lot . 
for good instructions on how to use the moka pot ,  see   .  .  .   . 
the case extends slightly above the screen so that when placed face down ,  your screen won t be scratched up . 
other reviewers have stated this ,  and i do agree with them on that point . 
make no mistake about it ,  this thing is humongous . 
i have only used this product a few times on carrots ,  apples ,  persimmons ,  and other fruit . 
in fact ,  i have the otterbox defender for my ipad as well . 
makes a great housewarming or shower gift too !  . 
worked well ,  cake came out of pan perfectly . 
this organizer has helped me get a frustrated closet into shape . 
some was industrial solvent used in china to clean and the rest was probably from the air pollution . 
it doesnt need to be heavy . it simply does what its supposed to without any pretense or bs . 
bottom line get it  !  !  or get the updated one . 
the oregno color is nice with detail like fleur de lis on the edges . 
i have tried  and wasted money  on two other stylus pens for my ipad . 
on this one ,  when it is turned on ,  it stays on . 
i know ,  it seems silly ,  but to say this pro model is anything but fantastic is an understatement . 
i even make cute eggs in it and the kids love them . 
hello ,  chicken soup !  with wonderful matzo balls made with the easily harvested chicken fat . 
the bag was able to hold all the debris and disposing the bag was also easy . 
before i had the opportunity to review this ,  i saw a preview of it on cnet that looked promising . 
but the local shop still gave me the deal . 
the though of drinking ship coffee was distressing . 
i usually keep in the bedroom and use it for white noise to fall asleep too as well . 
the hook is a little cumbersome ,  making it likely you ll knock off other cups while removing the intended cup . 
i only purchase the four piece place setting when i get them . 
this product worked perfectly and i m % pleased with the item and the price . 
you get a brushed metal body with rubber covered handles . 
i am surprised that amazon allows these outdated reviews to remain on this site . 
the life on this battery is just amazing . 
clean up is a breeze as i followed the directons that came with it . 
things cook faster in this pan and meats stay moist and tender . 
you can also do dicing but it is not very practical . 
the size is just right ,  not too large to be bulky or too small to be efficient . 
i have had these for about a month now and use them almost everyday . 
there is no bass whatsoever ,  mids are pretty muted and highs are pretty much the only thing you hear . 
i was more concerned with the quality than the actual length . 
but as someone whose had those other pans . 
once the num_num minutes were up i turned off the stove and let it sit for num_num minutes . 
i use this a lot ,  including taking it outside . 
i ve been trying to incorporate more whole foods in our meals . 
i purchased this product to download pictures from my phone to my computer . 
when i speak with them while they are using it ,  there is little to no background noise . 
my wife and i love cheese and cut up a lot of squares for all kinds of snacks . 
i highly recommend and suggest this product if looking for a wash board . 
no frill ,  and no damage after months of use . 
oz .  ,  in proportion to the size of the press . 
what they don t tell you is that the eartips are much improved . 
nothing beats it for the ability to produce beautiful slices with a minimum of effort and skill . 
i attribute that to the good job the air filter is doing . 
a little research goes a long way for sizes . 
it looks great in my all white kitchen next to my standup mixer . the quality is great . really ,  no complaints . 
this is a good size for modest portions and smaller jobs . 
i saw these and decided to get them . 
you have to press the siri button on the iphone num_extend
i keep this in my car to charge my phone when i m driving . 
we have had numerous of these over the years . 
i am one of those who tends to use his ipod about num_num to num_num hours a day . 
a definate must buy for your serious baker . 
with my phone indoors and me outside .  .  . ride my bike with phone in my pocket . 
what else could you want ?  you should definitely buy this ,  unless you don t boil eggs . 
prbably use this thing num_num days a week . 
the built is solid and the sound is wonderful . 
this particular one is perfect for large ampints of vegetables . 
it s a screen protector it does it s job . 
comfort is certainly no worse than the previous motorola device i had ,  and probably better . 
after being accidently left in a very cold car overnight ,  the coffee inside was still warm the next morning . 
coming from a traditional kettle ,  its definitely an upgrade . 
it s also a bit tough to get the core out of the middle after making the cut . 
i like it so well that i bought a second one for my office . 
no fuss ,  no decoration ,  just a good sealing stopper . 
cutting the skin off vegetables or fruit is effortless and cleanup takes no time at all . 
the instruction booklet does give some examples of how far a full charge in the pack will go . 
three snaps  two on the sides and one on the top  open the inner case . 
there aren t any crevices or corners that are difficult to clean . 
this is the perfect sharpening device for people who own global knives . 
about num_num months ago i tried a different juicer and used it for num_num day . 
i can t tell you how many times that mixer have been used . 
if you have to get a timer ,  get this one . 
it securely covers the entire iphone ,  not like those other cases that leaves the top corners exposed . 
that is an issue with my water and not the cookware . 
beautiful and i love it !  !  i could not have gotten a better deal anywhere else . 
i would add a thin utility knife and a boning knife to that list next . 
i bought this juicer to create juice from wheat grass ,  spinach ,  and other leafy products . 
in order to properly clean it after use ,  this means that you have to invert the whole machine . 
also the charging case that it comes with quite convenient . 
it looks fantastic ,  is well balanced ,  light ,  but not too light . 
those days are gone but having one in my sink again made it like a memory . 
i ve never actually seen a glass like this before and that s after num_extend years of lounge lizardom . 
we have had this can opener for at least num_num years ,  and it still works perfectly . 
i was without a knife so i went to my local knife shop to buy a temporary knife . 
i am amazed at the edge created by this sharpener both on the axe and regular knives . 
they are very well built and have a good solid feel to them . 
this washable clone far exceeds original product in quality and utility at a lower price . 
love nordic ware but was amazed when some of my specialty cakes flipped out easy without breaking . 
it looks simple enough but holds strong and has protected my phone from many drops onto the concrete . 
it arrived very quickly and i love it . 
i m retired and learning about herbal preparations ,  for fun and home use . 
motorola is happily locking these down ,  whereas with the htc devices ,  it s more of a token effort . 
never have i made such fluffy pancakes !  easy to clean and feels comfortable in your hand . 
and it appears that once on ,  they re going to stay there until i decide to take them off . 
within the week kitchenaid shipped a pair of the mixer attachments to me ,  no hassle . 
this is not a headphone that will make you stand out from the crowd . 
there is a youtube video site of instruction to help you through the process . 
took about num_num years of off and on cooking to do it ,  and num_num to become perfect . 
i have older cinnabar coasters that are significantly thinner  not sure why  and they will fit fine . 
two battery s ,  plus a charger !  love it !  awesome battery s ,  would buy again . 
i bought this for a friend who had the lower quality model ,  that stopped working well . 
it is a little stronger then the original so i use both as the same time . 
it pays to spend a couple bucks extra for a genuine htc product . 
i ve been slowly sprucing up my countertop clutter and decided to try a garlic keeper . 
it looks stylish but is all plastic ,  which surprised me ,  since the image hinted at some chrome parts . 
it saves your hands from all that work . 
only one complaint ,  it sounds like a motor boat . 
i have tried most brands of phone headsets and no one beats the quality and sound of plantronics . 
it makes a great espresso style coffee and it couldn t be easier . 
this is a well designed coffee maker and makes great coffee . 
i like this timer because it will time up to num_num hours num_num minutes and num_num seconds . 
i thought this would fit the bill and offer some padding . 
other cups fit under it ,  so if you are not going out ,  you can use a regular coffee mug . 
it worked great !  people were able to see through it enough to know which foods they wanted seconds on . 
we have made linguine and ravioli with it and they both come out perfectly . 
the pictures on the product page are a little misleading . 
the color gives your counter a splash of color but not overpowering . 
i bought it for my wife because she usually drops her phone . 
all in all ,  a very nice inexpensive appliance . 
i bought the num_num year accidental $ warranty for my unlocked international num_extend galaxy note in december num_extend
the sales person was able to locate the box and manual as well . 
this little iron ,  which has its own storage case ,  has a retractable cord . 
should come with small rubber feet to prevent sliding on hard num_extend
soft cheeses however ,  are a little harder to grate . 
its good for texting and has nice call quality . 
notably ,  there were the grit and other nasties in the bowl for me to dump . 
i also let my cats sleep in my bed with my husband and me . 
my wife and i know how to use food processors and we have used cuisinarts literally for decades . 
of course being corelle it is light weight which i am into at this stage in my life . 
when i use a bluetooth headset ,  it is fine to use the holder . 
i can talk to everyone without any difficulty from background noise . 
it rotates around to allow for use on either ear ,  which is great . 
if you can read ,  you can throw together the ingredients . 
go for it . >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>addenda :  a few disappointing qualities have arisen since my initial report . 
as you would expect ,  this is extremely sharp . 
i love how it s a screen for the front and back . 
i think the gauge metal is ok and good for most slacks ,  even jeans if not extra heavy . 
i tried keeping it from getting dirty ,  but it seemed like just anything in the air attracted to it . 
they hold a good ,  tight seal for the food . 
after a few years they will get dull just like a knife . 
produces good baked results ,  easy to clean ,  great product . 
i also prefer the blue writing to the red . 
these have held up very well so far ,  been using them a few mos . 
no driver disc or software to mess with is great . 
i don t believe its my phone thats the problem . 
brand new ,  fit well ,  and matched colors fine . 
nice to be able to charge num_num phones at once while traveling . 
i also love the classic retro vibe which works well for my table . 
i love how you can see the battery level right on your iphone . 
not one thing i can find to improve . 
the one we had was a little old . 
i am really glad i bought this size . 
it is well made and should truly be something to hand down to my children and grandchildren . 
typically i just make one cup of rice . 
cool ,  calm ,  collected and concise ,  too . they ll not believe it ,  i assure you . 
also ,  sometimes at dinner ,  the two youngest kids use these plates . i love the color . 
i have a more expensive set that is thicker and better finished . 
generally speaking ,  these sort of water filters break ,  clog ,  or don t function for very long . 
note :  i purchased my iphone num_extend at an authorized apple store . 
i agree ,  it works great for flipping fish without worrying about the meat falling apart . 
it the perfect size and easy to use which is what i was looking for . 
this would be great for younger kids learning how to make their own breakfast before school !  . 
most people would complain ,  but that is an extraordinary feat for mine considering how much i use it . 
there are several discount packages available for voice ,  sms and data which can reduce the cost of these services . 
almost as if the case were part of the phone . 
as others have commented ,  this garlic press has a bit of heft to it . 
it brews quickly and stays hot for quite a while . 
i am not associated with any company and all opinions are my very own . 
okay fpr the price this is a must have . 
these are simple bags that work great for treats . 
it s not exactly annoying ,  or even distracting ,  but it could be a bit more dim . 
they re made of stainless steel and of good quality . 
take both your anker and original battery ,  so when one runs out you can use the other one . 
for the price ,  i cannot complain one bit . 
there are only two negatives ,  and they really are not that bad . 
i showed the unit to two friends and they ordered them the next day . 
saves lots of time when making stews ,  etc . 
the loudness i did not find a problem . 
the nonstick coating is exceptionally tough ,  and ,  best of all ,  it cleans in the dishwasher without any problem . 
overall ,  i like it . edit : my husband loves this juice pack . 
however ,  we re glad we have it and we would purchase it again given the chance . 
i expect it to keep holding for some time . 
i can hold the phone vertically or landscape . 
i can make a bowl in less time than a television commercial takes . 
i was able to charge my phone even though the power was out . 
my bad for buying them anything with an i at the front . 
turns out it s been a huge help in the kitchen . 
i use the smallest container on the top for condiments like hummus ,  olives ,  and tabouli . 
it fits perfectly ,  cleans easily ,  and looks good with out stainless appliances . 
at all the retailers in town it costs at least $
beats using a knife to peel carrots and other veggies . 
you could use it on your car or a window at home . 
charging my curve num_num is so much easier now and it look so nice . 
the stand mixer fits nicely under out cupboards . 
but since the spare battery holds its charge for a long time ,  i don t do that all that often . 
use it in the kitchen ,  on the grill ,  at the camp ,  wherever . 
if you don t know what num_num inches is ,  than ask your husband . 
now ,  that i have a granddaughter that loves to cook . 
great blender for it s size and it does not take up a lot of space . 
i bought this apple corer so i could core my apples more easily than with a knife . 
i had to learn to handle the processor with a bit of force to attach and loosen it . 
only con ,  i do not know weather to use this with regular hand soap also . 
i was moving around my house with my phone on my counter in my kitchen . 
bought it in case i needed it and still have the old battery ,  this one in the package still . 
i ve had several pizza stone which all feel short in one way or another . 
dry grocery store brand standard white will toast using a num_extend to two setting . 
the knives are great and the pressure cooker made my double thick pork chops juicy ,  tasty and tender . 
we didn t need labels because we memorized what the spices are . 
i love anything le creuset and this stockpot was not a disappointment . 
i absolutely love this case for my white iphone . 
its sturdy design should last a number of years . 
i tried a couple of hard shell cases on my num_extend and they were ok . 
the rest of the time ,  you don t even know it s there . 
make sure the proper pressure is attained and mantained . 
orion gadgets is one of the best companies i have bought from on amazon . 
everything gets picked up from the carpet and the vacuum is powerful and very reliable . 
i am using the jabra num_extend with a sony ericsson num_extend
i didn t even like microwaved bacon before we got this . it s easy to use and easy to clean up too . 
this product arrived sooner than expected and seem to be of a good quality . 
if you have a samsung phone this charger will work with it . 
next to the klean kanteen it looks great . 
i always hand wash this pan because i want it to last a long time . 
nice and slim profile so it s not bulky in your pocket . 
i hate the artificial smell that bagged microwave popcorn spreads throughout the house . 
blades are still sharp and it still works perfectly . 
all it took was a quick wipe and the baked on sauce wiped right off . 
i purchased this jar to store dog food in . 
i know this is to be expected with a nonadjustable cheap sharpener . 
after two years of use ,  i am still using it . 
this is one of those  other  times ,  but in a good way . 
it just will not swivel far enough away . 
these are great for preparing perfectly shaped eggs for breakfast sandwiches . 
microwave poppers; don t get me started . this is the one . 
there are like num_num colors for this bluetooth . 
i have seen this juicer used by chefs on tv . 
a few slides through the sharpener and your knife is really sharp . 
my wife s headset ended up at the bottom of her purse ,  never to be heard from again . 
the nozzle should really be changed to point down ,  into the glass . 
with the body glove and seidio case ,  it was pretty easy to open the kickstand . 
my case arrived today and i couldn t be happier . 
bought two of these for my children s num_extend in december . 
we have juiced our own pomagranates with great results !  would recommend this model . 
a necessary accessory to your lodge dutch ovens !  sturdy and will last a lifetime . 
we even had a central unit installed in out last house . 
in the past week ,  i ve had two guests sleep on them and both said they were wonderful . 
folks can t tell that you re on a headset ,  and that is what you want . 
makes the cupboard look more organized as well . 
it s nice and thin  thinner than the belkin case  . 
its mainly when looking at it from the side or when its off . 
i used this for the first time this weekend and boy was it so good . 
i ve used this machine to clean num_num carpets so far . 
although a rice cooker ,  this machine can do anything a crockpot can and more such as steam vegetables . 
metal knob feels thinner ,  but going from memory here . 
we were looking for a good but small toaster oven . 
loved using this with my iphone num_num because it matched the cover . 
i use it on my parmesan cheese all the time . 
the manual says use this feature when making num_num or less cups . 
i frequently use it in place of a wok for stir frying ,  and it handles browning exceptionally well . 
i was concerned that it would not provide a wide enough variety of blades . 
these simple devices help keep wine fresh for longer . 
i have owned this sealer for over two years and use it several times a day . 
the batteries had just as good of capacity as the stock battery when it was new . 
though not glossy ,  it still picked up fingerprints somewhat easily . 
yet it s plaint enough to remove easily if you do need to do a battery pull reset . 
it is hands down the most used knife i own . 
the price is now up to $ and lists the standard price as $
the loop gets in the way of your hand when mashing . 
it can cause a popping noise and a little bit of a mess in the microwave when it happens . 
most of us that live in urban areas have become accustomed to the reliable nature of mobile phones . 
this coat rack is well made with quality materials . 
no problems with the release valve ,  it work well . 
even the cashier was shocked when i brought it to her register . 
we have made pizza ,  cookies ,  and bread on it . 
i had a set for years ,  and have been very happy for their durbility . 
more and more cars are coming with bluetooth integrated in them . 
i use it at least once a day . 
that said these may be inexpensive but the quality is there . 
i love the unique way you turn it on and off by flipping the extended mic pic . 
it looks exactly the same as the picture . 
to my surprise ,  almost every toaster they sell has received five stars . 
which of course makes us suspect that krups designed them to break or get lost in the first place . 
i put the skinomi techskin on the face of my phone ,  also . 
i would recommend this to a friend or anyone looking for a nice docking station . 
very inexpensive and it works ,  where the one i got before this cost more and was defective . 
it does not cause the cd tray motor to cycle . 
i received the product and it was is good shape when i received it . 
because the yogurt is prepared in num_extend containers ,  it is really easy to grab and go for lunch . 
there s not much to say that hasn t already been said so i ll make this short . 
i honestly love the beef jerky that you can create . 
it is a beautiful machine and looks great in my kitchen . 
i don t have any problems cleaning it or using it . 
i use handsfree quite a bit as this allows me to multitask . 
the timer works beautifully and is a snap to set up . 
it s slightly thicker than i anticipated and thus makes the phone feel  fat  . 
oh ,  why did i wait so long ?  this is a wonderful help in the kitchen . 
the top lifts off and you can brush it . 
tip .  .  . soak in warm water one hour for tight fit in pop mold !  . 
best yet .  .  . they work wonderfully and they can do it by themselves . 
also ,  they only have a single button ,  so no volume controls . 
we were able to use the other phone for gps too . 
search online and you ll find countless ways to use your kitchenaid . 
paring the device was very quick and painless . 
i bought a couple of these sets because i decorate my cubicle at work several times a year . 
yes it adds a little bulk but worth it for most if not all . 
it changes to blue when the battery is fully charged . 
liked them so well ,  i bought a box of num_extend
its ungainly shape and design make storage a challenge . 
apparently it is a nominal title having little bearing on reality . i highly recommend it . darin . 
i have a larger pan from this  family  and i love them both . 
this pot would get num_num stars if not for the small base . 
more expensive than the cheapies at wallyworld ,  but will last a life time . 
there are apparently problems with the bowl breaking ,  but i haven t used it nearly enough for that to happen . 
i have always purchased it brand new except for the vintage pieces i have found on ebay . 
i use it for baking one or two sweet potatoes . 
i already do canning and have a ton of mason jars at my disposal . 
this does not fit the verizon version of the samsung note ii . 
the ones here all work as data transfer too . 
i m happy and my knives aren t dulling any more . 
sure wish more of those products were available . 
that s about the only negative thing i can think of about it . 
the picture quality is very good in outdoor situations . 
wanted a grill because i love sandwiches and this is definitely worth the purchase . 
these are great tongs ,  as are the silicone tipped ones . 
prior to owning a kitchen aid mixer i was not a baker at all . 
we haven t had any run off of grease  fat  so that hasn t become an issue yet . 
they are also large enough for baking brownies ,  serving puddings ,  and many other things as well ,  i m sure . 
however ,  it s the function ,  expandability and compact size that make this a great rack . 
it does occasionally squirt a little bit no matter which side of the cut lemon you put face in . 
arrived from seller one day before estimated arrival . 
charge the pac using the included num_extend charger . 
you can t immerse them or put them in the dishwasher . 
i like stainless steel cookware ,  like all clad ,  but i like everything else in my kitchen to be white . 
i drink a lot of water ,  so i change the filter often . 
shortly after receiving the replacement we located the original shears . 
i ll explain . on the plus side ,  i really like the simplicity of this grill . 
contrary to some other reviews ,  mine neither leak nor stick . 
these are a little cheap ,  but they still look nice . 
but the price was too good to pass up ,  so i took a chance . 
i wish every product i bought met my expectectation as well as this one . 
it is one of the best screen protectors out there !  !  easy installation . 
i ordered the replacement screen kit at num_extend and had it the next day . 
these work great at keeping the shower curtain up . 
so it may be too expensive to make later in the season . my question is . 
again ,  on your desk ,  it would be fine ,  but not playing for a group . 
isn t it enough that i m using dishware and silverware at all ?  !  . 
honestly ,  with the gorilla glass screen ,  you don t need anything more . 
i have all hardwood floors and two cats and it really keeps the hair volume  in the bag  . 
let me assure you it is very secure but at the same time easily removable or adjustable . 
followed the recipe in the book and used bob s red mill semolina . 
it will hold a lot more food than you would expect . 
i like that there are num_num in the package . 
i bought two of these last week and i was truly expecting more . 
until i bought this thing i was unaware how much a conventional bottle opener hurt to use . 
i totally recommend this product ,  super easy to use and clean . 
this cooker cooks delicious tasting rice all the time . 
when lightly floured it cuts out yeasted donut dough cleanly . 
however ,  i would like like to emphasize that the specialty of the roadster compared to other bluetooth speakerphones . 
i ve only just begun to use it ,  but it s the nicest one i ve ever used . 
also ,  this case allows for a connection to the headset plug while in the case . 
if you leave one behind ,  hey ,  it s only $ totally pleased with these clever little gems . 
i love everything about my thermos travel mug . 
i used to be an otter box fan . 
i love being able to rest a lid on this thing . it s just so convenient . 
however ,  the large one does hold a full bag of sugar num_extend with some room to spare . 
i ve had the first num_num for over num_num years ,  and now have about num_num more . 
some reviews indicated that the lids did not fit . 
i read some reviewers said the handles bend . 
i d prefer a normal cutting board but i chose these because they are lightweight and cheap . 
it still works as well as the day i bought . 
for the price with all these things i received ,  this was an unbeatable deal . 
i also grow bonsai trees and i use small clay pieces in the mixture of soil . 
wide enough for my big self to stand securely  this is nicely wide  ,  num_extend
the wood and leather holder work well ,  look pleasant ,  and are well sealed . 
i recommend these ,  not only are they a great price they re from a well know company too . 
this as such other oxo products work as advertized . 
i guess the only complaint is that i wish it was silent  :   haha along with a silent vacuum . 
i also use them for salads ,  vegetables ,  and as serving dishes . 
my son loves this too and is an avid angry birds fan . 
it has a large handle that is very easy to hold and the blade is very strong . 
better than i could have imagined it to be . 
overall though ,  i like the racks a lot . 
after num_num months ,  though ,  i found out that the machine is not reliable . 
easy to use and small enough that it fits anywhere in the kitchen . 
after only two months ,  i  traded in  my blueant num_extend for this device . 
be careful ,  it will be hot as you handle it . 
they both broke eventually after a year or more . 
my family is german and i wanted a maker that creates proper spaetzle . 
either way i managed to set it up by applying a little more force that i initially wanted . 
i usually don t reply while driving but reading them is just as bad and dangerous . 
pretty much perfect ! i have a few other cast iron pieces of cookware and i absolutely love them . 
the proximity sensor is exposed ,  but that s my only complaint . 
i ordered a second pair so the days i wear them more than num_num hours at a time . 
we have a very small guest bath with a pedestal sink . 
just add a little water ,  the meat will come off the pan easily . 
when num_extend was plugged into the powergen external battery it continued to play the content . 
you really do not even notice them once they are applied . 
i have never had a mope or broom fall out of the clip . 
i often would take the hard outside off for less bulkiness while working out . 
i ve never used the slot to pour things in because i don t want to get the top dirty . 
it almost felt like it wanted to fall off . 
i used this in my nexus num_num in the adjustable mounting on my mazda num_extend
after a month of frequent use ,  the tool shows no signs of use or wear . 
i was surprised to see how much dirt was in our carpets . 
i never used it as a belt clip because it would pop off way too easy . 
personally ,  i like to keep my phone as light ,  slim and thin as possible . 
i was looking for a nice black can opener for my kitchen and decided to try this one . 
there was a loud grinding noise and the motor would not longer turn on . 
at first look i couldn t figure out how it could possibly have clear outgoing voice but it does . 
it can heat frozen snacks and make them even more perfect than an oven can . 
all i can say is good things about this rotisserie . 
it goes through several increasingly smaller screens before being put in the cup . 
having come from the curve ,  it was very noticeable . 
it keeps cold beverages cold for an hour or two but i don t use it much for cold beverages . 
i do begin with a new purchased yogurt every num_num to num_num weeks just to freshen things up . 
taste these before adding salt ,  you will probably want to add none or much less . 
anyone who is a heavy user should buy it . 
i have used them to connect to my computer and the data function works just fine . 
i was so nervous about buying it though after reading them that i wanted to weigh in . 
thinking that i could get a bigger one later . 
just about any but the largest lemons will easily fit . 
i looped the wrist strap into the old num_num case and it never fell out . 
there is only one small problem the design wears off quickly . 
my large electric oven is terribly unreliable temperature wise . 
if you have any questions ,  feel free to leave a comment !  . 
it looks like something nasa uses to process rocket fuel !   :  i absolutely love my num_extend
i m usually indoor anyway when i use my iphone . 
so i bought it . i love it so far . 
i already have this vacuum and use these bags all the time . 
as a result ,  i don t use the handset unless i have to !  . 
but nothing on the battery shows it is on and working . 
they are sharp ,  beautifully made ,  and a true professional tool to work with . 
cook perfectly and clean up like nothing else . 
the best review on here is from lissie . 
i guess you need to know your measurements to fully appreciate this shelf system . 
and second most of these in ear headsets require a snug fit in the ear canal . 
banana pudding is a particular favorite with them and i use several variations to reduce calories without sacrificing sweetness . 
i replaced the previous one i had as i lost it . 
i bought both just to verify this point . 
i don t always use plastic spoons when using them ,  but they show no signs of harm . 
also ,  this knife can be put through a commercial dishwasher without any problem . 
each strip of clips fits precisely within the cabinet door opening ,  but there s no room for error . 
i wanted to make my own herb spiced popcorn and decided to get back to popping my own popcorn . 
good price for the package size and easier to purchase than having to go to michael s  across town  . 
buy this im sure you wont regret it . 
the cones keep getting separated as i move things about in my cabinets . 
the controls are simple and accurate ,  and the cords are all generous in length . 
compact to fit on my key chain without getting in the way . 
i looks nice ,  easy to clean and the handler which i found people complaining it is the right size . 
i ordered a replacement from randomby and it was about the same price but fulfilled by amazon . 
all in all ,  i could not be more satisfied with this processor ,  and i highly recommend it !  . 
where i live ,  pyrex products are selling for double the amount i paid here . 
this keeps your coasters on display and your furniture safe in style !  !  !  !  great price too . 
the first one i bought i had to give to my friend . 
the os is just intuitive to me and the icons and graphics have always looked better to me . 
the iphone num_extend is a good fit  not too loose ,  not too tight  . 
this was a christmas present and was a great hit . good and sturdy quality . 
i m hoping that the marking survive the dishwasher . 
i purchased this to repair a broken screen . 
i have only tried waterbath canning and look forward to pressure canning and cooking . 
surprisingly ,  the plastic can hold odors that transfer . 
i picked up this headset the other day and i m relatively pleased with it . 
probably gives it another few days without any problems . 
i roll my towels and put them in the shoe slots . 
if the task does not require my num_extend knife i always go to this one . 
if you have not tried steaming ,  this is a great place to start . 
that s a very good thing as i ve used it to make gravies and a homemade cheese spread . 
it makes popcorn that tastes wonderful and it is so easy to use . 
for under $ shipped i now have a charger beside the bed and at work . 
it seems ridiculous to sell a pan without one . 
num_extend screen is big enough to do my touch screen function watch videos ,  text on num_extend
if you are listening to music and the phone rings ,  it will pause the music . 
if you re looking for a good stainless pressure cooker in a reasonable size ,  this is it !  . 
it works wonderfully ,  cooks all my eggs to a perfect hard boil . 
i wasn t sure why the price is too low compare to other retail product . 
in addition ,  some of the settings take a full five hours . 
that is why i will always have a rubber case . 
these tips rock !  they are of quality stainless steel and seamless !  so no worries about rusting . 
my late husband and i received this as a wedding gift in num_extend
there s no notable difference to the original screen . 
it fits nicely in my large refrigerator because it is more narrow than round . 
fits perfectly ,  but has more capacity  orig is something like num_extend
i am adding a star because it has held up well and is easy to clean . 
i purchased this to replace an atrix that got stolen from my home in a burglary . 
the case has a nice texture to it and feels secure in my hand . 
covers nearly every plug ive ever needed in asian except for india . 
it is also somewhat awkward to carry around in my pocket . 
heavy duty ,  clean looking ,  pretty to look at ,  large ,  and easy to use on heavy items your cooking . 
i ve used it outside on windy days and my recipient never noticed . 
my previous separator had no straner at all . i think this is the best you re gonna get . 
i had called a friend to come pick me up . 
it s a really great way to carry my blue tooth . 
i made all kinds of fillings from creams to puddings and filled them up . 
it has a wonderful weight to it and just feels good to hold . 
at first ,  i didn t want to get it because it didn t have the color i wanted . 
i highly recommend it !  i order two batteries and never regretted ordering them . 
not sure if i got a good deal ,  but wasn t too concerned about it . 
i liked them so much i bought two sets again . 
it protects the back and corners of the phone ,  however it does not protect the front . 
also the bowl gets so hot you have to use a pot holder to take it out of microwave . 
i thought maybe i could grind it fine enough with the blades . 
from what i did use them for ,  they seemed to have worked well . 
the plastic chrome top is subject to fingerprint smudging ,  far more so than the steel container itself . 
called for a teensy screwdriver . i am using num_num of the num_num hooks . very satisfied with product . 
it is money well spent ,  lasting for many ,  many years . 
these are definitely quality and meant to last . 
the wood has a beautiful glossy finish and a rich brown stain . 
it moves very easily ,  and comes with a handle if you need to pick it up and carry num_extend
i m very happy with this case and would recommend it to anyone . 
i have been using it now for over a year and its still doing the job . 
my wife is on a health kick for the family . 
this is a powerful ,  easy to use machine and i use mine everyday . 
the problem is i am very unhappy with the charging sleeves needed for the devices themselves . 
other than that ,  i did not find any scratches or any signs of previous ownership . 
after checking the reviews ,  i felt this one would be sufficient for my needs . 
then i just had to get the tabs out of the air vent . 
then removed jar to cool to num_num degrees f . 
even the most reluctant of cooks will appreciate this thing . 
i have one stationed in my kitchen beside the stove ,  and another near my cat s litter box . 
its nice heavy weight great to cook with and you can tell it will last forever . 
let s face it ,  bulky sweaters are the bane of dressers . 
i feel the cone shaped coffee makers make a way better cup of coffee and these filters fit perfectly . 
it is very consistent and accurate with a simple and elegant design . 
perfect for making small amounts in a toaster oven . 
so everybody knows where you bought it and knows that you got it for cheap . 
i have yet to use the pin ,  but i m concerned that the diameter might make for more work . 
everyone is amazed at how simple it is to use . 
and what i ve quickly come to learn is that this thing is tiny . 
wow ,  amazon !  !  well packaged and nothing was broken . 
works great for small pizzas in my cuisinart convection oven . 
num_extend audio samples per second  ,  while wired headsets and phones sample at num_num khz num_extend audio samples per second  . 
i m easily able to pick up a single sheet of paper with these . 
and i wouldn t suggest mixing a cake as your first project . 
both times an egg cracked so the white oozed out of the crack ,  but still all eggs perfectly cooked . 
i purchased this baguette pan along with its brother ,  the french bread pan . 
this thermos french press is perfect for keeping your fresh brew hot while drinking the first cup . 
i needed to replace a current cupcake pan that had become dented after some use . 
it s incredibly durable and handsome and can be used for everything from coffee to wine . 
i use it while mowing the yard and working . 
this num_num cup i great for that and rounds out the set . 
this is a must have for anyone who uses their phone like a laptop . 
it does add some thickness and width to your phone ,  but it does a good job of protecting it . 
have not had to change it since i bought it . 
only happened on num_num of num_num that i have changed but just be aware . 
it handles the toughest of bread doughs to the most delicate of meringues and everything else in between . 
this is one of the best bluetooth devices i test it . 
i will just buy another one of these things for his car again !  . 
num_num different timers on it ,  which i ve used for different ebay auctions sometimes . 
i m quite pleased with the perfomance of this juicer; wasn t sure what to expect with its reasonable price . 
couldn t ask for more from my $  :   . 
it s handy .  .  . but you can also fit a pair of  your own  chopsticks in the inside loop . 
i also loved the coffee !  so i ordered one the minute we got home . 
my friends who hate covers saw my phone with this on it and didn t even notice it . 
as others have mentioned ,  this bodum press is very elegantly crafted . 
altman s in new york forty years ago ,  and it had not been sharpened since and was dangerous to use . 
it s also quite large so it fits a good serving of oatmeal . 
don t make the mistake that i made by holding on to those old wooden handle knives . 
you can cook one to seven eggs at a time . 
she was having problems with short battery life on her existing battery ,  and this has addressed that issue . 
after reading reviews for ateco products and wilton products ,  i went with the ateco set . 
it cooks the food quickly and is super easy to clean . 
every piece purchased was on sale making it easier to buy extra pieces . 
i have been running roombas for years and never bought a new filter . 
it s worth the money at full price ,  so a sale is way too good to pass up !  . 
so keep the large bottle next to the washing machine and store a back up bottle in the glovebox !  . 
works great and looks good !  keeps your phone protected and doesn t make it heavy . 
we bought this so we could start drinking fresher coffee  it actually does taste better imo  . 
perfect for storing in a vehicle for charging . 
i plugged it in and had no problems using it with my razr num_extend
if kitchen space is a consideration ,  this may be a hassle until you figure out a new storage option . 
this is the first non stick baking sheet i have owned . 
i really ,  really ,  really ,  really like this machine . 
this device is designed to be used on your computer with skype software . 
yes ,  i have all automatic sync functions turned off or to a minimum . 
we use them to heat stuff up ,  or for oatmeal ,  or to boil soup . 
on the pictures here it looks black with pink actually its more brown and pink did not like . 
i would not recommend it for large families . 
once a year i have professionals come clean all my carpet . 
i ve had this for year and it works great and very accurate . 
other than that ,  i have no complaints ,  especially condsidering the great price on amazon plus the $ rebate . 
i own several other brands of cast iron and this is the skillet i use the most . 
the louder  but not loud  noise is from the air itself being hit by the blades . 
this is a nicely american made plate cover . 
the espresso flows consistently ,  slowly and almost like syrup . the biggest difference is the taste . 
i love this addition to my turquoise fiesta collection . 
the mechanism in this one is smoother than the other had ever been . 
sometimes even throw a hand towel over one ,  and use it as a dish drying rack . 
in each one ,  i opened all their boxes and set it on a flat surface . 
i needed a case for my iphone and didn t want to pay the store  cellular  prices . 
these dishes are plain white but the fluted edges make them very pretty . 
i just purchased the white case ,  i love it . 
the price is fantastic ,  and prime shipping cannot be beat . 
it s protective ,  lightweight ,  and doesn t add much bulk . 
always good to have a spare battery handy . 
after reading several reviews i decided to order these for the droid x . 
also ,  it is very sturdy and can take lots of use . 
you d be surprised how many handles i have bent or broken that way . 
having dropped my iphone several times ,  i m glad this case was on it and my iphone is intact . 
you pay big bucks for at the mall . 
but this canner fits perfectly . some have mentioned difficulty removing the lid . 
my old lg env num_extend keypad was fairly compact . 
the blue tooth volume compared to hardwired volume is very noticeable . 
if i had wanted that i would have bought a pressure cooker . 
i usually keep the lid attached to the opener until i throw it in the trash can . 
i thought this was a dumb way to play scrabble ,  at first ,  but then i came to love it . 
work great with my phone and even better with my windows surface num_extend
i think if you try this one you will like it . 
this is a great attachment to my kitchenaid . 
great price and great quality product with many mounting options . 
after reading lots of descriptions and recommendations i chose to purchase the marcato . 
i added my own to the evaluation pool . 
good job all you guys at minisuit !  you have a new customer for life !  . 
also they are not automatic ,  you need hot water from another source . hard to explain the taste . 
i have had a few minor drops ,  and my phone is still perfect . 
this does the job and leaves no scars !  . 
couldn t justify the cost then and now i can t fully utilize it . 
when i take the cover off and try again the picture comes out perfect . 
making these has become a sunday morning tradition and the kids like to join in . 
there is a pocket slot about halfway down . 
it will work out nice as it has the bottom insert to drain water from the lettuce . 
i like to buy coffee in quantity when it s on sale at my local grocery stores . 
the customer service of this company is friendly and top notch . 
i always prefer this type of coffee maker rather than the electric ones . 
its a great thing to have if you wont be by a charger . 
it s quiet and not so big that it over powers the counter . 
the edges are smooth ,  no burs or slivers . 
if it were not almost effortless ,  it would have been a failed experiment . 
they are a quality stainless steel and fit the hand nicely . 
the  mybat  fishbone cover is available in numerous colors and styles . 
they have maintained their polished look and serve their purpose while looking simple and pretty . 
this steamvac just arrived a few days ago . 
has not failed yet and charges rapid fast . 
i always coat the cooking pan with olive oil . 
this knife handles well and is very sharp . 
i develop applications for ipad and the usual cord was being a pain in the neck for being short . 
this is great in every way except that it doesnt really keep coffee hot all that long . 
only wish i had one for my old oven . 
a winner  !  i say look no further  the best bread machine ever   !  . 
it is made right here in the twin cities area which i also like . 
after a lot of research ,  we decided to purchase this machine as it had the highest ratings . 
it works and my office looks much better from now on . 
i think i ordered one as a gift for my friend almost immediately after finishing my drink . 
i have had this case on my phone for num_num months now . 
these are cheap alternatives ,  but will work great if applied correctly and evenly . 
never ever use the scooper to melt butter . 
all of the items needed to hang it up are included and it went up easily . 
the recipes are wonderful and as imaginative as their store ice creams . 
i may sign up for a contract plan since i am so impressed with the device . 
the hinged end goes on the rail first . 
regardless of the attempt the results have been overwhelming . 
i am not that fussy and i think it is decent for the price . 
 but we don t use the ultrathin comb at all  . 
for a fraction of the cost of the otterbox ,  it basically works just as well . 
if it is too shiny ,  i use a junk bath cloth to remove oil . 
but after reading that this machine was quiet ,  we decided to give it a try . 
my unisink seems especially wide ,  but this fit with room to spare . 
so i bought this ,  and i have loved it ever since . 
importantly ,  it is emblazoned with the bose brand name so that you can flaunt your superiority . 
who needs to throw money away ?  these came in a multi pack and fit as expected . 
i bought this to replace my num_num year old identical popper . 
bought this for my wife for christmas and she loves it ,  and uses it every chance she gets . 
the over the ear clip was missing ,  without it ,  the unit falls out of your ear . 
we just ordered another one to have in the other end of the house . 
the plus is the lid for when i need to store it . 
they are well made and fit your hand nicely . 
if you have difficulty putting things together than skip this coffee maker . 
i would recommend this model honeywell product without hesitation . 
the funnels are great !  you get two funnels ,  a large and a small . 
i ve tried more expensive juicers and this one is the best by far . 
it s fast ,  convenient ,  and does a good job . 
i plan to make a lot of fondue type meals in the future . 
about a half hour to an hour later you have fresh delicious ice cream !  it s that simple . 
read what you want ,  but the iphone screens do scratch . 
it s not quite the length of a standard pen ,  and i see no reason it couldn t be . 
i don t think it is loud at all when on low ,  a fan makes more noise than this purifier . 
i am extremely happy that i purchased this phone  through sprint  and that i am using the android os . 
i like how the aluminum edge stop at the bottom is easily removable with two thumb screws . 
but i don t scramble or mix them much . 
i swear i already posted my review but here we go again . 
it also features voice answering using the plantronics myheadset app . 
i m guessing it expects more voltage ,  but whatever . 
i use espresso roast but only half of what is called for in espresso . 
i would buy again i only needed the backs . 
i like the texture ,  it is very rough which actually seems to be why it is non stick . 
no bending over to look from the side to make sure you have the right amount . 
wilton always makes a good product and i would not hesitate to recommend anything they sell . 
sent a picture of the crack and the replacement part was on its way fedex . 
i ve used tupperware and rubbermaid in the past ,  but nothing comes close to these . 
this has been the conventional design of bt headsets for some years now . 
i love this little vacuum and have no complaints at all . 
it defaults to a short  three second or so  clip but you can change that . 
it was made lighter and smoother if is an antique . 
my needs are simple :  good espresso for icing or for soy lattes . 
i have been using this phone for about a week now . 
i have had mine for over a year ,  with no quality problems whatsoever . 
i notice no ill affects on flavor by doing this but your experience may be different . 
i love matte look ,  but i ve seen it clear too and also looks great . 
i purchased for a friend of mine and she loved it . 
be sure to keep your fingers wet and the protector soaked until you squeegee it . 
my extensive research into purchasing these was based upon functionality and price . 
my girlfriend and i both agreed that this hoover achieved the same ,  if not better results . 
it s easy to shove under delicate foods ,  say an omelette ,  and sturdy when moving around veggies or basically anything . 
i connect the phone to my atv while ring so i can see if someone calls . 
would not recommend if you have lots of heavy cleaning to do . 
i would recommend this adapter who plays a lot of controller games . 
amazon has taken a great approach to screen protectors . like razor blades ,  screen protectors should be considered disposable . 
i have not been sorry for a single day . 
the temperature in the pot may then not be sustained long enough for bacteria to be killed . 
if anyone actually charges $ for it ,  though ,  they re crazy . 
this will give you an even better cup in the end . 
unless you re handling them while eating bacon ,  it s unlikely they ll pick up a visible fingerprint . 
i might order another one so that i can do it correctly . 
even just pureeing fruit and putting them in these molds is a hit !  . 
the zeico brisk brew is a god send for the frequent traveler . 
about every six months to a year ,  we would have to buy another . 
i guess the plastic just got  tired   fatigued  after so much flexing . 
i am always grinding spices and this one is excellent and easy to keep clean . 
i got this just in time for a trip i was taking to the east coast . 
they are more of a brushed steel finish instead of a shiny finish . 
this cost a bit more than the basic num_num cup model ,  but it was well worth the extra cost . 
you can let it hang dry or use a towel to dry it . 
it still lets the crust brown beautiful and does not hurt the edges at all . 
i bought two sets of these ,  i use mills only . 
this replacement battery works great and the price was very good !  i would recommend this product to everyone . 
i think i may have to buy another pair soon ,  as these seem to migrate all over the house . 
bought these baskets to organize cake and pie pans in my pantry which easily becomes a jumble . 
we just put these knives in the steak knife slots in the knife block that our original set had . 
now i clip this onto my jacket ,  and i m all set . 
the only thing that would be better is to have bags ,  but i still give it num_num stars . 
one is relatively easy to find ,  the other requires a bit of hunting . 
ordered the case from amazon and got it today . 
this pan is so useful i had to buy another one . nice pan .  !   .  !  . 
this unit is a cut above the run of the mill coffeemakers out there . 
due to the wide cleaning path ,  it took less than num_num minutes to clean my living and dining rooms . 
i have owned some very good ,  very expensive break knives  even a j . a . 
the build quality is very sturdy and strong . 
this battery lasts slightly longer than the oem berry from samsung . 
i used this wax on my homemade cheddar cheese . 
i have been using this product for the last num_num or num_num years . 
sometimes you can feel a piece of equipment and tell that it s not well designed . 
still the best travel mug i ve ever seen . 
directions on application were backwards ,  but worked out ok and was applied a second time . 
i took the divider out and just use it as one bigger pot . 
i bought this product right before i left to use with my iphone num_num  also a recent purchase  . 
this keeps the flames from licking up the sides of the wok and burning your hands . 
it worked perfect ,  no problems what so ever . 
they were exactly what i ordered and i was happy that they actually stick to my phone . 
but they will come loose eventually ,  again and again . 
so far in the short run i like this one . 
ninguna queja con el equipo ,  ademas solo se conseguiran refurbished porque el equipo no salio mas . 
perfect for what i needed and works very well . 
it s so nice to not have to sit in that one horrible seat next to a power plug . 
but ,  if you can get passed that ,  it does work pretty well . 
this bumper case fits perfectly on my iphone num_extend
you get perfectly shaped cookies every time ! these are great for other uses as well . 
omg ,  i make the best popcorn at home . 
i have an ipod touch ,  att nokia phone and lg virgin mobile phone . 
luckily ,  though ,  you can just put it back in to get the leftover kernels to pop . 
i recently bought this scribe and it looks like it s going to take some time to get use to . 
it also doesnt have any screws sticking out like i saw on other brands . 
the lack of mass means lower heat capacity and thus the handle heats up much more quickly . 
this was a quick fix for my tiny bathroom . 
or you can read the manual that came with . my wife loves it . 
voila ! worth the money paid for and would gladly recommend it . 
it has honestly changed the way i cook . 
i especially like its ability to vacuum under beds . 
originally ,  i was looking online for a different machine for my office just to switch it up a bit . 
otterbox sent me an all new case in the retail box within num_num days of emailing them my issue . 
the side clamps also blocks the buttons on my phone as well . 
they are simple to use and the colors are nice . 
i had seen one of these sticky pads once before ,  so i though it worth a shot . 
so hard to find these !  i love them to clip towels or whatever . 
it is nice that it is wider at the base than the old style . 
a shame this is so loud on its quietest setting because it does move a ton of air . 
it s just that great of a price point !  . 
i highly recommend this case ,  especially for the price . 
if you have a use for casual dinnerware ,  try these out . 
after using it for num_num months ,  i love it . 
i m sure there will be quite a few sales just based on my party . 
this is definitely louder than the bionaire but not prohibitively so . 
i recently remodeled my kitchen ,  and the most complimented part of it is the addition of this pot rack . 
they make my city water much more palatable and easier to drink . 
i wish that i could cook a steak with the same consistncy of making the perfect egg . 
i have used this on several flat screen tvs now . 
i ve never been much for paring knives as the handles are too small for comfortable use . 
i purchased this spoon from a local kitchen store and it s fabulous . 
so my family had to wrestle over them to see who got to use the crackers . l . o . l . 
i like the little claws that open and close . 
i have been using this since nov num_extend
i love this mat !  it really holds my phone still as i drive . 
ive dropped my phone plenty of times and this case keeps it safe . 
my wife never takes her case off and thus is probably the reason why her rubber case is snug . 
i am definitely going to buy a num_extend  for myself  to grind spices . 
read up on the skills and tools you ll need . 
i have been using this for a few months as a backup charger . 
as i recall ,  cast iron skillets used to have longer handles . 
it is the quickest and neatest way of cooking one or a few potatoes . 
no more warming ,  melting in a glass in the microwave . 
the stain is very clearly a different one . 
but you ll have to keep in mind that nokia will slowly stop rolling out updates for symbian . 
my cheesecake batter was much thicker and more viscous than water . 
this guy does the job and will power to spare . 
when blown at or near me it turns a stifiling room into an almost bearable room . 
fits nicely onto normal glasses and shakers to keep the ice and stuff out . 
definitely would not recommend for a weaker or arthritic person . 
i was pleased to see it was current and for such a reasonable price . 
just what we were looking for !  they re not pampered chef or pottery barn showy ,  but they re heavy and durable . 
in introduction , my wife and i live in a num_extend wheel rv for num_num months of the year . 
i got this item for a trip to peru . 
i use bottled water like ozarka spring water . 
so ,  we originally got this to roast coffee . 
the ice cream will only come out in a soft serve consistency ,  not hard like a grocery store brand . 
the right angle adapter is just what i needed and the price was right . 
i would highly recommend buying one because it s super inexpensive and does the job very well . 
it s a decent dock and does what is advertised ,  but don t expect anything fancy beyond that . 
i do like how they put the attachments on the case . 
it arrived in good shape and very timely . 
i also have a zagg screen shield installed and the shell goes perfectly with it . 
i must admit that this not the exact oxo can opener that i have . 
i am so spoiled by these that i rarely use a  normal  spatula anymore . 
saucepan at a local store for the weight issue ,  i decided to go with the helper handle . 
compared to the other options this is an attractive appliance that does its job and for a fair price . 
not literally . this product works well at keeping grease and sauces from splashing around your microwave . 
great speaker stands ,  well designed and very sturdy . 
you just have to be sure there is nothing on the screen when you install it . 
i use these to hold my bose cube speakers which sound great when i watch movies amd sports . 
other nsf approved thermometers will give you the correct temperature ,  but taylor thermometers are built well . 
the cast iron is traditionally meant for a woodstove ,  stone hearth or firepit . 
it s big enough but not too big ,  like if its some movie theater trash can that s num_extend
be very careful when pouring this out  !  . 
wish i had found out about these sooner . 
also ,  it holds an edge much better than my other knives . 
i have this on top of our counter and use it all the time . 
i didn t purchase these to use as outdoor trashcans . 
my nose is stuffy if i don t use it . 
now my only problem is figuring out a way to get my husband to eat the veggies !  . 
the vibration actually  feels  localized and not just vibrating the whole phone . 
nice design and is availablke in numerous different designs . 
it looks good ,  it s unobtrusive on the ear ,  it s a cinch to operate . 
the noise is only really noticeable when it is quiet late at night . 
i ve had this vacuum since february ,  and i m still crazy about it . 
this press sits on our counter all day every day ,  so far so good . 
we also have two cats and it has seemed to help with the amount of hair floating around . 
with this slicer i get the perfect slices every time . 
after just a couple of days of use we already have a full load of apple and banana chips . 
these are of old fashion style but with new technology . 
i liked got this one for the fact that the cover fits and locks . 
i ve owned this scale for a year now and just ordered one for my daughter . 
these units will run for well over num_num years if you keep the filters clean . 
i could get a contracted phone but i do not believe in paying for what you dont use . 
some of the things i regularly chop in it are nuts ,  onions ,  peppers ,  hard cheeses and bread . 
this case is really good for this phone . 
this is a great mandolin for most home cooks ,  it s not heavy duty but it gets the job done . 
i am so glad i made this choice . 
i checked out a lot of diffrent models and still wanted this one again . 
these have the slick texture of polyester ,  which some find unpleasant . 
i also make lasagna noodled by just cutting strips after i rolled it out . 
it has broken in nicely and held up very well . 
this was easy to install and had a perfect fit . 
this product is very thin and is what attracted me to buy it . 
also ,  the edges on the case haven t faded like some of the cases do . 
they are a decent price and get the job done . 
after it begins to spin ,  you can add pressure and increase speed . 
she s trying to cook healthier and i think that this steamer will be a welcome addition to her kitchen . 
i no issues and it came on time . 
not a high tech high end product ,  but is lightweight and easy to use . 
i had place settings for num_num and really only wanted to order num_num flatware settings ,  but couldn t . 
you just have to know how to put it on right . 
it uses oil and works on any stove . 
i just put mine into a mason jar . 
baked goods never come out with burned bottoms and cook more evenly on this sheet than on others . 
you can hang several sheets of paper with just one magnet and it won t slide down . 
perfect for gym use and while working in the yard with over the ear protection . 
does what a hot air popcorn popper should do ,  and it does it well . 
the only thing you need to do is get the new firmware update which was released in early dec . 
this is my favorite pan ,  and would definitely purchase the scanpan brand again . 
obviously it s sturdy and didn t have season it right away . 
this is one of the small kitchen appliances that i use the most . 
in a couple of minutes or so ,  you have a bowl of healthy popped corn . 
it has only been used once however so i can t speak to the durability factor . 
it doesn t matter which way the battery faces; the charger will detect polarization . 
so i thought of this as a good option . 
seems as though it will protect the phone fine and it still is small in the pocket . 
they are a great bumper for your phone when you dont want a bulky case on your phone . 
people say i sound great from their end  much better than using the phone s microphone  . good music sound ,  too . 
had a plantronic num_extend with exelent battery life ,  no so great sound . 
i use my knives every day and i don t like them dull . 
i have a pizza stone ,  but enjoy pizza cooked on the cast iron much more . 
incredible that something so inexpensive can be so reliable . 
will buy another one if i have to . 
not this . typically i brew my coffee using a num_num cup melita cone . 
immersion water heaters are great since they can boil water quickly . 
i found this on amazon and bought it after reading the nice comments given by other buyers . 
the phone fits securely in the holster ,  but can be quickly removed from it . there are some minor concerns . 
they are stiff to open but that should be expected ,  they are new . 
they are much less expensive than alternatives ,  so i put up with it . 
its now num_num and i still have this item . 
however ,  on the knives that i ve tried which have the right angle ,  this sharpener works very well . 
this is the best wallet phone case out there for the price . 
works just as good as my metal one with the plus of not scratching . 
i purchased this originally to help scoop and transfer all my chopped items from the counter to the pan . 
just don t fill the basket all the way or use standard coffee grind for coffee . 
you might want to get a stockpot in addition to this set ,  for a housewarming or shower . 
these come in very handy as the item we replaced was bulky and in the way . 
it s the smallest pressure cooker i own and perfect for cooking for one or two people . 
i bought this for my bf and have seen what it can do . 
nice spatula ,  but for me it has a learning curve . 
there is no other like it and i ve tried many . 
not much else to say about it right now . 
which is what i really wanted . this product will last me the rest of my life . 
i am glad i bought it and would recommend it . 
if you want super tough protection go with this case . 
but after a few complaints from friends not being able to hear me ,  i went and purchased these . 
with such a great case they could have come up with a better belt clip . 
i ve tried handwashing it but fat and plastic are tough to clean without super hot water . 
i got this thermometer last year and it s never done me wrong . 
this is better as a cleaning  aid  than as a complete replacement for sweeping and vacuming . 
it s a lot more reliable than some of the expensive in your ear headsets . 
however ,  i ve not had a problem with that smell affecting my other dishes . 
just don t pour in a hurry ,  i guess . 
i am very pleased with the kinivo num_extend bluetooth headphone . 
it s deep enough to put multiple dresses if you desire . 
i use it a lot for cutting messy things like tomatoes . 
i ve had this cutting board for about three years . 
it is heavier than i thought it would be . 
the winter white frost white  and just white are a perfect match . 
you can though ,  leave the upper lid off ,  and then it works ok ,  if you watch the tempurature . 
the colors are cheerful ,  and they work fine . 
flexible rubber so i really felt like my phone was protected . 
love it ! sony num_extend ear bud style stereo bluetooth headset . 
with my blackberry or samsung i never had to this . 
i like to dehydrate apples ,  and this has simplified that process by a million minutes . 
mybe if you do not use much garlic then you will only be buying  another tool  for the drawer . 
sound quality was very good  and much much better than tiny laptop speakers  . 
this is actually my third pair of bluetooth headset . 
and i use simple green to clean off the plastic base and any other greasy spots . 
you won t be disappointed with this particular kitchen gadget . 
they seem to keep the heat distribution really even ,  and give the bottom some appreciated stability . 
used this season ,  they clean up well and have no regrets . 
i know this has been around for a while but i haven t tried one until now . 
in that case ,  maybe get a commercial vat for your chocolate ,  and a therapist . now ,  for the one problem . 
scanning the guessed direction of the antenna ,  my strongest signal was num_extend to num_extend
i ve loved all my chicago metallic products ,  including these pans . 
i don t really pay attention to the machine s timing mechanism :  i just use my regular kitchen timer . 
that said ,  this item is smaller than my keyfob ,  but it is short in length when it s opened up . 
i bought a used bike with one of these and was unsure about how sturdy it would be . 
baking sheets ,  under a roast ,  a chicken ,  or anything you bake . 
the packaging advertises noise cancellation ,  but i really don t think that this headset performs as the packaging would suggest . 
as with all american made lodge products ,  the quality is excellent ,  with smooth surfaces throughout . 
this num_num qt measuring cup is perfect for brewing up some tea for the summer . 
you need to grease the nonstick pans or else you re taken a chance . 
i m keeping at num_num stars unless something changes . 
i bought these as replacements for my nexus s num_extend cables and they look the exact same . 
i also like how the top of the mug is shaped . 
a must if you buy the my bread book . 
gee .  .  .  . all things seem to come back in style and this is a great example of one that should . 
it works better than the old one ever did . 
has a nice heft ,  opens and closes easily as long as you put it on straight . 
bought it because this is old brand i have had and lost during moves . 
i was looking for something to spruce up my alarm clock and this did the trick for $
but after using it for such a long time ,  that s to be expected . 
i have tried all kinds of tea warmers that require a tea candle . 
this fits right into a modern kitchen ,  clean brushed silver look . 
they came well packed and were shipped right away . 
this voice features is similar to the genius button found on the mytouch num_extend
it s about num_extend long and works well with my galaxy nexus . 
i was surprised that a modern headset like this lacks that feature . 
this are the right bags for the little hand oreck that we use all of the time . 
i have had them for a while now and used them quite a bit . 
this sweet unit is very easy to disassemble and clean with no hard cleaning corners or nooks . 
seems like i should not be excited about a charger but this one is great . 
absolutely magnificent in every type of use :  mostly in the kitchen ,  but any task ,  was accomplished perfectly . 
small ,  but still a little too large for a standard mug . 
it replaced one that i had used for num_num years . 
these oxo measuring cups are another high quality product in the oxo good grips line . 
in all fairness i m not sure if it was the headphones or my supersensitive galaxy num_extend phone . 
i am a satisfied shopper ,  and the lady it was bought for is quite content . 
if you have young kids ,  it is a must get . 
i ve had this blender for over a year now ,  and wow !  it s the best ,  period . 
it heats up to temp quickly ,  and perfectly presses and grills everything i have thrown at it so far . 
made to sit in a window and survive the occasional rain storm . 
that is over num_num uses and still going strong . 
 : the individual pans in this duo are num_extend in diameter and about num_extend tall . 
if you enjoy a good strong coffee ,  this is the pot . 
this one appears to be of the same quality as the old ,  and i expect many years of use . 
a great way to have a healthy breakfast in just minutes . 
i use this for everything from meringue to bread to pasta . 
i had an older kitchenaid ,  so i didn t feel i could justify the pricey upgrade . 
it looks in my closet exactly how it appears in the picture . 
when the iron closes ,  the batter will automatically spread . clean up is quick  especially with no overflow  . 
this cover is nice ,  the rubber finish on it does wear quite quickly thought . 
good amount of pepper comes out with each turn of the handle . 
this case fits very snuggly and provides very good protection . 
but so far this knife has been great . 
i love the strainer lid but haven t yet had a use for it . 
for the price ,  i don t think you can beat this thermometer . 
if you want your assembly guide with pictures and few words you ll like the qag . 
i have found this can opener to live up to being easy to use . 
now ,  my kids got to use them and myself and have plenty of extra for rainy days . 
if we could get the full range of knives in the grand prix ii design ,  we would . 
it just seemed to get in the way . 
needless to say ,  she is not known for treating her phones with the utmost of care . 
if you read the other reviews they state that the coffee is the perfect temperature and i agree %
i do not have a conventional knife block or other knives for cooking . 
my phone sits high enough so i can see who s calling and not everyone else . 
we use it predominantly to heat milk in microwave . 
search one of the ipad forums for details . 
so far ,  every loaf came out pretty good . 
the food cooks evenly  with nice grill marks  . 
it worked great ,  but the consistency was nowhere near as good as the atlas . 
as somone who runs on a regular basis ,  i needed some good quality wireless headphones to wear when jogging . 
it will be worth it in the num_extend if you purchase the front and back cover . 
i also read some good reviews on it . 
this pan is just the right sixe for num_num or num_num people . 
this is by far the best all purpose corkscrew . 
the rubber o rings sometimes pop off the stir stick . 
there is slightly less room in the handle area for this handle than the miu france colander . 
the recipe we made was the french vanilla . 
she is num_num now and this machine is like a painter s brush to a canvas . 
doesn t work on laminate surfaces  they re too rough ?   ,  but that s not the fault of the design . 
it s antiglare ,  but still leaves finger prints ,  which is fine with me . 
his phone is now working as good as new . 
i don t care much for it but this is what girls wanted . 
the blades are sharp enough to work butter into the flour very well . 
i really like this pot for stews and chili . 
its roomy and i like the shape and feel . 
if you don t have a pan like this ,  your kitchen is sorely missing . 
these are good protectors and it s nice to get num_num of them in a pack . 
practically no mess and clean up means sacrificing about a half dozen paper towels . 
it has a retro look and the whistle is great . 
this is a functional bowl stop whining about looks . 
it s kind of big and bulky to try to put away when not in use . 
either the handles would break ,  the interior would scratch and become ruined making it impossible to use . 
i ve had the chemex for about a week now . 
they are so sturdy and do not have bendy handles like previous reviewers have stated . 
most comfortable set of earbuds that i have ever used . 
pan is thick on bottom for even cooking . 
the grinder seems quite durable and easy to clean . 
i like the attachments but rarely use them . 
i was expecting a decent stand for my iphone and hoped it worked with my ipad too . 
i bought this case for my mom awhile back . 
amazon has been using a delivery company  name unknown  that is not the most reliable or responsible group . 
he likes the fact that he can put his license and credit card in it . 
i seem to recall a review from someone about bearing down to make it work . 
it has outlasted and outperformed every coffeemaker we have ever owned . 
i have a very padded ironing board and had some trouble with my iron tipping . 
i make my wheat bread for health reasons and had a hard time slicing it with my knives . 
this is the right size chemex for a singleton or for a pair . 
i ve had one of these woks for years . 
i can however ,  use them and i will buy a larger one next time around . 
had it several months and will probably have it forever !  . 
these new cookie cutters work fine ,  but be very careful how much pressure you put on them . 
the higher the cadr number ,  the greater the volume of air gets filtered per minute . prices at num_extend cadr .  . honeywell num_extend
got a bad steam burn on my arm because of my stupidity . 
i turn the largest element on high and go . 
callers should be able to hear you clearly at highway num_extend
i was really getting tired of coffeemakers and the fact that over time they had issues . 
it works with any bluetooth enabled cell phone . 
i ve made carrot cake ,  pumpkin pound cake ,  and banana ,  blueberry ,  cherry ,  chocolate chip mini bundts . 
works on the i phone and i touch . 
the temperature should be no more than num_num to num_extend
the filter is easy to clean and never needs paper filters . 
on paper ,  the lg env touch screens are better . 
this is such a handy thing to have around if you enjoy white wine . 
thus i m usually making use of the sun visor ,  which makes the bluetooth speaker face away from me . 
scoops are nice and small too ,  so you can control portion . 
there is a lot of benefits for using lemon while cooking or even drinking lemon water . 
for my hands  small  the handle works perfectly . 
the bottom is microwave safe  loosen or remove the lid before heating ,  plastic  . 
i was looking for something i could could put the peel and all in and this is it !  .

i would buy again ,  make a good spare cord . 
it is also very slender and does not take up much space on the counter . 
i have a new phone and i m still using it as we speak . 
i knew that i could trust thermos brand . 
comes with an assortment of ends for other devices . 
not only do i use this pan for pizza i use it as a broiler pan . 
but the real test in my mind is with tomatoes . 
it s good to know pyrex refuses to do that . 
once it has beed pushed down to its maximum you pour the coffee and enjoy . 
doesn t seem to burn the coffee when left on the burner for several hours . 
i have owned this garlic press for almost num_num years  bought right here on amazon  . 
there are solid and look to be well constructed .

a nice addition that may surprise you with its utility . 
replaced the battery in my child s android and it worked perfectly . 
the downside of being soft is that it absorbs scratches easily and they remain on the screen . 
and there s enough room in there for a bento box ,  small water bottle ,  and ice pack . 
but what it really does ,  and does very well ,  is make great coffee that stays hot for hours . 
the battery lasts a day with some inet surfing and light gaming . 
it seals just as tightly as a heat canned jar . 
easy to use ,  high quality audio ,  small physical size . 
i haven t had great experiences regarding sound quality on bluetooth devices . 
not flashy and crass like so many others out there . 
after heating the water it takes four minutes to brew . 
it s very easy to use but you have to remember that it doesn t come with the ready beep noise . 
i never thought i would use this that much ,  but for the price why not give it a try . 
both of these unglazed dishes make a significant difference in the texture of the bread s crust . 
great quality as well ,  i would do it again !  . 
you can t press on the lid to drain liquid ,  because the lid doesn t fall into the can . 
received my first mitt as a gift and have purchased additional mitts for myself and as gifts for others . 
i gave num_num stars instead of num_num because of the cost  its expensive  . 
it works great with skype and google talk voice including making phone calls . 
it served its purpose and its sturdy enough to get a lot of uses out of it . 
it would be nice if a more perfect one exists ,  but so far i have not seen one . 
however ,  the construction is equal to my nokia num_extend and the num_extend feels solid . 
they feel and look so much better than the plastic dishes we ve used in the past . 
sound is good ,  everything functions ,  good range ,  and best part :  battery life . 
i took out my arugula and spinach ,  and couldn t believe how dry it was . 
i loved having a num_extend sync cable for the time i did have it . 
so i passed it down to him and ordered my beautiful red professional num_extend
i use this with my global knives and it does a great job sharpening them . 
i bought it for my niece to go running . 
there is a smaller bar code label on the bottom and a longer branding label along the side . 
i give them both num_num stars  amazon represents this as i like it and i do .   . 
i use them for when i am out and can t be reached . 
if you cook with stainless or cast iron ,  this is a must have . 
it looks nice enough to sit on the counter . 
i purchased the kitchenaid num_extend for my husband s birthday . 
am thinking about buying these for presents for some friends for christmas . 
i ordered this thermos based on the reviews and i was very happy not to be disappointing . 
this meets all requirements for a person who loves to cook . 
this cooker will take up some counter space . 
call me crazy ,  but i purchased this because no other maker could authentically brew my favorite chicory blend . 
you had to fight to keep the button pushed . 
i buy whole beans and grind them just before i make coffee . 
thanks to the other reviewers who said to turn it more often in the beginning . 
i love this pan !  i wish i had more of them . 
it seems to be as good as the original charging cable . 
so far i m pretry impressed with this unit . 
we ve found this to vary depending on the thickness of the batter . 
we make coffee at least twice a day ,  and the only drawback it the cleanup . 
don t always have time to wait for a regular charge time . 
those that love high tech devices with lots of features will drool over this phone . 
much cheaper compared to purchasing the discs individually . 
these are good ,  straight forward paper coffee filters . 
come to think of it ,  i enjoy using this as well . 
update july num_extend this case and another case for extended battery . 
i ve been using win mobile products since the hp jornada so am no stranger to the winmo interface . 
i have also just purchased the num_extend active case after using an otterbox product on it as well . 
she also wanted me to convey that kudos to your company and employees for a job well done . 
as everyone has said ,  this product is great ,  well built ,  and it works . 
i d recommend these to anyone who needs a decent of bluetooth headphones without breaking the bank . 
great for listening to podcasts ,  and spoken word . 
we switched to this one and it fits in the fridge much better . 
camera goodies such as picture and video editor software integrate nicely into the camera app itself . 
and it works great !  no charging issues ,  no problems with various can sizes . 
this scraper is awesome !  it has a sharp edge that really gets under the food . 
i ve recommended them to other friends who ve purchased them . 
i chose the right one . if you get this headset ,  you won t be disappointed !  . 
this has to be the best case for your droid x if you need rugged protection . 
i don t need a new top but just in case i wanted to see if i could get one . cheers !  . 
battery works as expected and ccmaccessories had fast shipping . 
it fits my small kitchen counter and stove well and doesn t look too cheap . 
i also never had rice that fluffy before either . 
this dirt devil i ve had for num_num years and is still amazing . 
i see grams will be famous at that school . 
price was very reasonable and definitely worth it !  . 
my wife has the original razr which uses the slightly larger mini usb . 
this omni fat separator works as promised every time . 
i do have a door that is perfectly smooth with no coating and it works great . 
i would certainly buy the otterbox for any phone i aquire in the future . 
the whole device is elegant; like an apple product . 
i am using the over the ear hook and it does not interfere with glasses and stays balanced . 
i enjoy baking little cakes and brownie from this pan . 
but this has none of those . this is a must have product if you like iced tea . 
regardless ,  i am not sorry that i bought this product . 
so ,  if you need the full amount of num_num cups ,  be prepared to wait for it . 
grilled at num_num degrees for about num_num minutes . 
horrible to clean the waste reservoir and not enough suction . 
so i have lowered the stars accordingly for this particular knives . 
i got a gray battery icon with an exclamation point over it . 
otterbox is the best for a reason !  i love this case ,  and have dropped my phone numerous times !  . 
i find the cuisinart brewer very easy to use . 
but it worked well for blending soup ,  making smoothies and whipping up mashed potatoes . 
i have not found either of these issues . 
and qualified for amazon free supersaver shipping as well  delivered five days after we ordere it  . 
i wish it would push more juice out to the device . 
this kitchenaid blender is the best in the business . 
not this bose gem !  it fits like a dream . 
my townhouse has a finished basement which i use as a den . 
i bought these to make mini cheesecakes for xmas gifts . 
i have purchased about many of them for me and for gifts ,  we all love them !  . 
this is a big mama ,  so make sure you can store it . 
better to transfer the pizza off and cut it on another surface  as expected  . 
my last speck case weighed just num_extend ounces . 
this grater feels better and more secure in our hands than any that we ve used in my memory . 
i usually sit water in the pan for an hour or so and then wash it . 
so you can not immerse it ,  but you can take it over to the sink and carefully clean it . 
makes great tea and great holder for coffee . 
they only last a couple days in the fridge unless it goes into the foodsaver . 
it is ,  but it does have it s faults . it is really hard for one person to work this machine . 
very sturdy and can still be held in hand with ease . 
these work really nicely for clamping bags of chips shut tightly . 
from there you squeeze the arms back in and they  click  as they lock into place against your phone . 
we have had it for about a month . 
i have num_extend was given num_num and found the third in a different design . 
i got this product fast in about num_num days it came just like the description says . 
you can also see the dirt and dandrift on this case also . 
i had to buy another one . i liked the features that this one promised so i ordered it . 
one of the lids ended up with a cleaning agent inside it which then dripped into my food . 
it does make some noise ,  but it also gets the job done and that s what is most important . 
i read the reviews and decided against getting this ,  despite how much some reviewers liked it . 
this is an incredible tool to use in my kichen . 
i use this bluetooth with my iphone num_extend
and there were occasional losses of sound for some small fraction of a second . 
we buy a lot of items from the organic grocery store in bulk . 
i used to use an infrared thermometer ,  but it was pretty inaccurate . 
because of the smaller basket ,  you will have to do couple of batches . 
i just found the christy embrace brand of towels ,  and i couldn t be happier . 
i was looking for a plain ol  black case for my captivate . 
would like the mesh to be a little tighter . 
a very good machine that ,  with proper care and use ,  should last for years . 
it s hefty and feels solid in my hands . 
there are a million microplanes ,  from zester to course to ribbon ,  to spice ,  on and on . 
being diabetic i will be making my own sugar free ice cream and sorbet . 
no hang ups or stalls ,  just powers right through . 
the only con is that it s extremely long . 
i just ordered my second yogurt maker after the first one was no longer performing as expected . 
the pasta server is excellent for not only pasta but steamed veggies and sauces . 
i bought this style with the silver retro look as it perfectly matches my cuisinart coffee maker . 
i have bought a number of these and the simple human brand is higher quality than the others . 
i have been using it for about a month and no complaints . 
once you ve determined your grind consistency and quantity ,  you ll brew a perfect cup of coffee with this machine . 
in addition to sandwiches like grilled cheese and reuben sandwiches  yum !   . 
i leave mine directly on my kitchen island . 
i grind my own beans pack them lightly in the cup poor in the water and thats it . 
my very first num_extend and needed a screen protector if i plan on giving it away in the future . 
i give a quick spray of pam to start and spread it around with a paint brush . 
i bought and sent this to my daughter . 
this is easy to change once old one gets all dirty . 
the cutting capabilities can handle anything they were made for . 
it s a deep dish but not overly deep . 
if you need the best coffeemaker then do not even think about it just buy it . 
it toasts bread and it does leave the image . 
i figured apple was offering me a refurb for $ either way . 
i will use the steamer and the ring to steam veggies over pasta water for example . easy to rinse clean . 
she uses the egg cooker on a regular basis ,  and is very satisfied with the cooker . 
and the perfect size for a num_extend cookie . 
this phone has a built in fm transducer ! the nabigation was awesome ,  the apps were great . 
buy two you will always have a clean one on hand ,  absolutely the best size for any kitchen . 
i wonder how long the case will remain intact ?  . 
let me explain ,  none of the voice active features work . 
turn the cooker on and it beeps when the eggs are done . 
their not charging you a arm and leg for it !  . 
in fact ,  the motorola num_extend is one of the most overlooked ,  underrated giants among personal wireless speakers . 
the grating prevents most objects from poking into fan blades  especially when you have a toddler around  . 
the potato went through like butter and flew halfway across the counter . 
frozen ,  thin ,  thick ,  self rising ,  it all works here . 
yet many people ,  including my butcher ,  use these knives with great satisfaction . 
i particularly appreciated when they came out with these preseasoned varieties and have a lot of them . 
i read the reviews on this product before i purchased it and do disagree with a few of them . 
he absolutely loved it and makes popcorn almost daily . 
i was at macarthur center last weekend shopping ,  watching a movie ,  and dining ,  from num_extend a . m . 
i am actually considering getting a second on of these . 
this thing stays hot and cooks food fast . 
this sat on my shelf for a long time . 
it was permanently bent ,  split and chunks missing from it ,  but it was the only flexible scraper i had . 
measure your items and compare to measurements given for the rack before you order . 
for the price ,  i d buy this tea pot again . 
since i have to let it run so long i think the heat damages the power cups faster . 
these dirt devil filters are terrific and work perfectly with our red devil vacuums . 
just as expected it is a great mixing bowl . 
has made my ipaq num_num much more usable as a phone . 
just wet your fingers ,  wet both sides of the protector ,  slap in on and work out the bubbles . 
it s ok ,  but a little large for our morning omelet . 
the first one came with the bunn coffee maker . 
brita would make more off of me if i changed more often . 
i bought this for my husband and he loves it . 
it looks a lot better than some cheap ebay versions out there . 
maybe it is the type of honey i use ?  the top is chrome colored plastic . 
found this coffee maker to provide better coffee ,  and hot coffee !  yay !  . 
the motorola triumph is a thing of beauty and comes closest to the handheld device i ve been dreaming of . 
the belt fit perfectly and the brush spins as it s supposed to . 
this case can be significantly discounted on amazon compared to the msrp and other online shops . 
good purchase ,  i recommended that product to other customers . 
maybe there s an explanation behind why i m so impressed by oxo . 
i m sure i ll get years and years worth of use out of these . 
fit two sets of dishes and the platter one fit a few all wrapped in towels . 
i own construction buisness and a heating and air conditioning buis . 
the cleaning is very easy to clean . i am going to experiment more on different way of season the chicken . 
haven t had any issues with putting the containers or lids in the dishwasher . 
the inner insert is sturdy and easy to clean ,  though the outer shell gets scratched easily . 
this led to burned sides the first time . 
you might have to work them a little if you go days between baths . 
they do what they are made to do well without requiring much effort . 
we have fought a leaky pitcher since the first day we purchased the unit . 
i have two of these units and they are a lifesaver . 
this review is basically a copy from the review i wrote for the smaller version of this spatula . 
i bought this vacuum after returning the windtunnel plus . 
i ve thought about a bread box for awhile now but never found an appropriate one . 
this is just perfect ,  buy it and you will not regret it . 
it is so nice to use this and get the same size cookies . 
i have to admit ,  this is an overall great product . 
the brush included does a great job of cleaning the filter basket ,  but you have to clean both sides . 
the lid captures steam and is slanted so the liquid is added back to the food . 
so i ordered all the small dishers available on amazon . 
got this one at a great price and it works great ,  no issues ,  thanks . 
if this juicer ever breaks ,  which i guess someday it will ,  i will buy another just like it . 
after several months of use ,  the water just filters through it a bit slower . 
this is the best spice rack for me . 
i got this case for my mom as her christmas present and she loves it . 
thanks to the other reviewer for the info !  . 
i ve had non stick for ages ,  always wanted a set like these . 
toss the ground into the garbage wash out and your done . 
i made a modification by slicing away at one end of the pouch to allow headset access . 
every piece in the set is very well made and useful . 
keep the protector as close as possible to the device to minimize new contamination of dust ,  num_extend
it will give you talk time and various other data when you turn it on . 
useing this along with some oxegen degenerators should eliminate stale seasoning ,  and other products as well . 
i chose this one because of its size ,  its good reviews ,  and its color . 
with my new droid x i had to get a protector that wrapped around all the edges . 
secondly ,  they are a little big ,  but for what they do ,  its understandable . 
fit perfectly on my bluetooth and in my ear . 
she is very happy with her phone again . 
i cannot imagine anyone not truly loving this amazing cake pan . 
the dough was pretty easy and the rollers worked just like they should . 
i am so pleased that amazon offers quality products like wmf . 
has a broader mouth than the one i purchased previously . 
the cover stops chunks of stuff from getting into the broth but doesn t inhibit the flow into the cup . 
makes the phone much more  holdable if that is a word . 
i would buy again if i had to . 
if it were to break ,  we d have to use and alternate method to hold it on . 
fits real snug onto the phone and feels good in my hand . 
it is a wise investment for any homeowner that wants to maintain their home . 
can t find in stores ,  glad to find here . 
my husband was filling it the other day and the carafe cracked . 
the size and design were just what i needed . 
i needed it to store  used  cooking oil . 
got it for our old iphone num_extend works well . 
i have purchased libbey products for decades and for everyday use ,  i have never had a problem . 
i used two of these to hang a num_num ft extension ladder horizontally on studs in my garage wall . 
it s the best water i ve ever tasted actually ! do not overtighten when you install the filters . 
had a problem with shipping but vendor replaced immediately ,  but next was broken also . 
so far i ve only used it on cheese but will plan on using it for zesting in the future . 
it is perfect for our use ,  which is ,  to pick up stray cat litter . 
it snaps off  if you put the lid down correctly  so no more boiled dry kettles . 
this is one of the better ones on the market . 
it s so much more convenient than propping my phone up on various objects . 
i have not had any problems with either of the two that i bought . 
the velvet inner lining is a slight concern ,  but that s what holds it from slipping off . 
otterbox  ,  it has enough soft silicone material to almost guarantee a safe landing onto a hard surface . 
i am even considering getting the toaster oven size . 
i m looking forward to using this more when the weather warms up here in michigan . 
automatically labels itself with see through sides displaying the bag within . 
it looks really nice hanging by the door in our apartment !  . 
fits perfectly and has a great feel to it . 
the headset connects with both at the same time seamlessly . 
the cover isn t the best; its pretty bulky and not made of the best plastic . 
i purchased one of these for my suv for a long cross country trip . 
it works so well and is the perfect size for a pot of tea to take with you . 
they look lovely and are light enough to pass around the table . 
these tongs are an improvement in that the locking mechanism is pull up . 
the buttons cover over the buttons are easy to press . 
powerful for cakes ,  and easy operation ,  that all i asked for . 
i was suprised i could purchase a replacement part for my num_extend year old food processor . 
last a long time and stays on the phone until i take it off . 
the build quality seems good mostly cast iron . 
i use bobs red mill white popcorn and it turns out perfectly every time . 
it is basic with just blend or pulse and does exactly what you need . 
anybody want to buy a set of totally babied henckels ?  i need more knives i like to use . 
i use it for work all day long and no one ever complains that they can t understand me . 
in terms of sound quality and this headset does not disappoint . 
as someone who doesn t like holding a phone up to my ear for very long ,  i like wireless headsets . 
i like the fact that it also comes with a screen protector . 
i eventually realized how useful this could be on a daily basis . 
but the unit doesn t seem  flimsy  to me or anything . 
the major grease drips down into the bottom so that the chicken doesn t taste greasy . 
top rated by cook s illustrated this product is durable ,  well designed and worthy of its top rating . 
i got this for my mom for christmas and she needed a pair badly . 
i like that it uses a usb connection; it makes it easy to charge and so much more versatile . 
i make my own barbeque rub and always hated grinding enough pepper for the recipe . 
this will vary based on how much coffee and how it is ground . 
this cuisinart coffee pot is a true num_num cup pot . 
this heats evenly and has non stick ant a reasonable price . 
nice feel to the pan and it did a good job with no hot spots . 
it is also helping me to heat milk on my stove . 
the thickness should be wonderful for that type of use . 
we have used this paper towel holder for two years . 
it makes the perfect amount of coffee for two people . 
it uses a larger prefilter and true hepa than it s bigger brother the num_extend
it was really a toss up and you probably wouldn t go wrong with either . 
this is one of the newer phones that tracfone offers for not only calling but texting as well . 
most of it seems simple ,  but those of us who are new to this need help . 
i m constantly on the road ,  and tend to talk a lot on the phone . 
i actually picked this up to charge my kindle paperwhite at work . 
it cuts my work in half !  works exactly as described ,  maybe even a little bit better . 
also love that you can see the logo in the back . 
these are wonderfully sturdy bags that are the answer to my prayers in the allergy department . 
i find the strength of the suction to be adequate for anything i ve used it for . 
notably ,  nokia internet radio is not included ,  nor is it available for download yet . 
it is extremely sturdy and easy to use . 
i have used it frequently and find it tremendously helpful . 
they include vibrating alert  i ve turned it off  ,  call accept and call decline  much needed  . 
i have been wanting a waffle maker for years . 
this wilton tip is the perfect size to ice cupcakes . 
it works great and easy to operate also saves so much time cooking the same meal . 
i am so happy to have another oxo brand kitchen product . 
they last about num_num years or more if you take really good care of them . 
when you use this peeler ,  it doesn t take most of the fruit or vegetable with it . 
this replaced an electric griddle with a thermostat . 
i love that i am able to put the phone in landscape mode with this car mount . 
i ll most likely opt for the defender series again once this case runs its course . 
i came across this and decided to give it a try . 
but other than that i am very happy with this purchase . 
i liked so much i bought a second set . 
i bought some other cheap lame one and will never go back . 
you just have to experiment and decide which size you prefer . 
once the surface flakes you should throw the pan out . hard anodized is a different type of treatment altogether . 
i has gotten a white standup kitchen aid mixer a few years back and absolutely loved it . 
very nice easy to use universal phone holder . 
amazing i love the color it goes with my pink charger as well and defends the case as well . 
it gives me a full charge from empty on my galaxy num_extend with still lots of juice left . 
it s  instant read  because the dial is constantly adjusting to the temperature based on the metal inside the stem . 
since its all one piece ,  you can t submerge in water . 
with the festive season approaching ,  wanted to have my meats cuts evenly . 
 not sure how it will do in single digit f yet . 
this is perfect for dumping a pound of hot roasted coffee into a mason jar . 
this is a great gadget for spreading just a bit of flour when working with dough on the countertop . 
finally ,  after watching an episode of  iron chef  ,  i did a search for mandoline s that iron chefs use . 
after you push your your toast down then you can select one of the push button choices . 
i was delighted that i could still find this kettle and have been very happy with it . 
we like to eat dinner off of them . 
since it is only making two  large  cups ,  the brew process is fairly quick . 
this machine makes delicious boiled and poached eggs . 
most docks will not work with thick cases ,  but this one does . 
had to buy more for my family once they saw mine . 
i don t feel like i need to treat it too gently so i can put it through its paces . 
apartment which is carpeted except for kitchen and baths . 
i ordered this case for business and dressy occassions . 
it pixelates for about num_num seconds if i change the scene . 
basically it was just what i was looking for . 
however ,  it totally worth the trade off for me !  . 
this phone is a back up just in case something happens to my newer phone . 
it does its job in mashing pretty much anything you want . 
i love the fact that you can charge the sweeper and the extra battery at the same time . 
no problems with the dish cooking faster in one area than another . 
nice amount of lollipop sticks for cakes and chocolate . 
believe it or not it as done before my noodles were done cooking . 
previously i was using theacase capacitive stylusbut wasn t particularly happy with that . 
you don t need to worry about that with this set . 
fits in my samsung epic num_extend touch perfectly . 
when canning ,  you cannot do much else but watch the pressure gauge . 
this is a very large and impressively deep pan . 
hubbydearest gave me this for christmas ,  after we shopped various brands . 
these bottles went perfect with the nastagia brand hot dog cart i also bought . 
much better then that plastic versions that show stains . 
using flour tortillas the shells are light and crispy . 
i think it s just a marketing trick . overall ,  this scoop is great value . 
i was worried at first because it s all stainless steel but it s never gotten too hot to handle . 
some work perfectly and others wont stick in certain areas . 
i ve dropped it atleast a dozen times to my recolletion and it still works as good as ever . 
in the meantime i am really happy with them . 
and i keep iphone and microusb plugged into each usb port for charging whenever in car . 
it s been slightly updated and now comes with its own filter . 
great quality headset !  easy to use and to link to . 
you generally can t go wrong with oxo products . 
overall the amzer trumps the seidio in almost everything . 
i have since purchased several pieces of lecreuset ,  and it is truly heirloom cookware . 
they all come filled ,  with a few that i ll never use . 
at this point ,  i just cried and cursed the num_extend for being so big . 
my mixer sits against a black refrigerator and there was not one spot of powdered sugar anywhere . 
you should feel very confident with your purchase . 
i also didnt really want to pay alot of money for them either . 
the pan can also be used for winter cornbread or brownies . 
since i have had this on i noticed the air smells better and cleaner . 
it is my favorite of the num_num or num_num i own . 
this adapter looks like a cassette with a wire coming out of the end . 
i already have a set of num_num anchor hocking storage bowls but i needed more . 
i loved how the bose securly fit in my ear and the sound quality is terrific . 
very high heat  as when placing a skillet on it  will damage it although better than marring your counter . 
this adapter works well and is easy to carry in your purse or while traveling . 
i boiled water with the filter and all ,  just before the inital use . 
i had the roomba for about num_num months and i am delighted with it . 
this is very much worth the money we paid for it . 
oxo good grips dish brush is one that will last for a long time . 
but i would say this is the best product i have found for pressing garlic . 
i recently purchased this for someone because the one they had previously had done its job . 
with that said ,  any scale over the num_num dollar mark isn t worth it . 
easy to use and even easy enough to clean if you did want to use them again . 
this one is similar to one i had years ago where it is snugit works . 
i also like that it has belt loops as well as a belt clip . 
i opted to purchase this pan because of its quality ,  size ,  and proportion . 
nice tart pan ,  but i m giving num_num stars because it s just a little flimsy .  .  . i m afraid it will bend easily . 
ademas trae una memoria microsd de num_num gb . 
nice for fridge shelves . bathroom cleaning ,  especially tile grout . 
two subsequent fillings confirmed that the gurgling noises will continue . 
just a cosmetic issue; no biggie for something so cheap . 
plenty of thought went into the accents ,  color ,  and shape of this phone . 
it s easier than having to use my oven mitts as its not as bulky . 
i got this phone as a gift num_num months ago . 
it works very well , and comes totally apart for thorough cleaning . 
you can t burn it if you forget that your cooking  one of my challenges  . 
it s not too hard to get the case on and off . 
with this ,  that background noise is very nicely suppressed . 
it loses at least a cup in brewing . 
i called customer service because i wanted to make sure i was going to get what i was ordering . 
the small container ,  i use for herbs and spices . 
if you do not want to be filling it every num_num hours or more then get a different humidifier . 
i m happy to report that my test kitchen was able to verify this information . 
we could not be happier with this purchase . 
the microphone swivels in and out of the way very well . 
it would pause ,  play ,  and control the volume on my tablet ,  but the forward and backward buttons were useless . 
it didn t happen to me ,  but did to someone else i know that purchased this . 
while it s not quite perfect ,  it s about as close as any case i ve tried  and i ve tried tons  . it s slim . 
the case is very unique and colorful as well . 
it s nice and light and isn t bulky on the phone . 
design unobtrusive ,  thought was given to footprint and profile ,  aesthetics were given due consideration . 
they are very comfortable and the blades come sharp . 
the yogurt does not leak around the screw top . 
i m not a techy ,  just an every day computer user . 
the music was clear and crisp even while he was kicking a soccer ball around the yard . 
i quickly got used to it and have no complaints . 
since i charged ,  my bb battery seems to be lasting longer  vs usb  . 
heavy ,  not balanced right and stop working after only num_num months . 
very heavy so it should be a very good one . 
it s nice looking and can be used on my induction stove which i love . 
the manual  if i remember correctly  said had num_num hrs . 
the handle is a little short but comfortable to hold .

i d still buy it again ,  great look and does well . 
just what we were looking for and couldn t find in a store . 
i ve had it for num_num months and use it about num_num times a week . 
this skillet will get hot enough and hold the heat .  .  .  . that is so important . 
i didn t want to return the case though ,  as it was so inexpensive compared with others i looked at . 
i have had dozens of them from many different vendors ,  some cheap ,  some very expensive . 
i may read the manual ,  but the problem with that is i only use these occasionally . 
love this for soups ,  canning and anything requiring a lot of measuring . 
keep watch on amazon as the price changes from day to day .

i tried a rubber like feeling case first . 
after reading reviews ,  i decided to give a manual grater one more try . 
it is made of like a almost leathery material that i did not expect and love . 
i guess the water boils in the aluminum bottom ,  which isn t ideal ,  but i still love the unit . 
the bladesafes take a little bit of practice getting them open . 
i feel like i m hearing the album and not my headphones interpretation of the album . 
this works good for carrying your phone on your belt or pants waistline and the stand works fine . 
i have seen these in various stores ,  but none were as well made as these . 
i didn t feel that it had the best sound quality ,  though . 
i also have an over the range microwave . 
i m hoping with the attachment it works even better . 
if anything happens to my cover i am going to order another . 
i usually only need less that a tablespoon or even less than a teaspoon ,  so the blender is useless . 
the case fits the phone nice and snug . 
for cheese lovers ,  a block and wire setup is the only way to go .

it came within a week and the picture is accurate . 
these fine particle might have been stopped by a paper filter but they don t affect the tea for me . 
i have tried numerous battery cases for the iphone . 
good big pot and the pressure release valves are very intuitive . 
i bought the num_extend inch version ,  which i think was around $ or $ at the time . 
i am sure it could be used to keep food in  not necessarily for marinating  . 
i should have checked the size of this before ordering . 
i was all set to buy another one and one of the much less expensive to boot .

i will never go back to cheap walmart appliances again . 
this is num_num charges off of one charge . 
this little grinder does the job perfectly ,  is easy to clean and stores in very little space . 
little tricky to get the air vent mount on . 
first it was the wired and then the wireless . 
it has power behind it ,  kneads bread without any effort ,  yet can make the most delicate of recipes . 
this battery wasn t used long but the time it was in use it worked very well . 
on day one i turned up the brightness and set the backlight to stay on longer .

i hope this one lasts longer than the other .

after a few moves from house to house ,  it went missing ,  and i ve always wanted another one . 
i gave it to my daughter in law and she likes it a lot . 
it still only makes one waffle at a time . 
not all that onerous as the unit completely disassembles in a few seconds . 
not for every situation ,  but it makes great roasted chicken ,  potatoes ,  and excellent country breakfasts . 
the best part so far ,  to me ,  is that they come already magnetized . 
all in all ,  nice produce .  .  . i deducted one star for my initial setup tinkering . 
i needed a car charger for my phone and this was exactly what i need .

they re manufactured very well so that there are no seams or any other weak points . they re not cheap . 
i had read about many people purchasing covers that were too small for the num_num qt . 
use it quite often ,  now my husband stole it from me !  great charger ,  great price !  .

shelly ,  i have one of these and have never had a problem with mine opening up . 
i think it will protect ,  but i think the case itself might break if it were dropped enough . 
this was perfect ,  cheap and fits like a glove . 
after reading all the reviews ,  i purchased the norpro . 
i hope they never discontinue this one ,  because if this ever breaks i will immediately buy another one .

everything is fine as long the bowl  even empty  is on the base . 
bought this divider without too much procrastination because it looked ideal for what we wanted and it wasn t expensive . 
all in all ,  this is a very high quality product that looks great on the phone . 
there s nothing wrong with this case .  .  . it looks the same in real life as it does in the picture . 
i have left them in water all day and there is no issue with rust . 
it is worth the counter space it takes up . 
great ,  cheap ,  just wish it had a sling or clips to put one . 
i love the fact that i can charge my phone and my extra battery simultaneously . 
in addition ,  the pan cleans exceptionally easily ,  saving time and energy . 
if one enters that information ,  amazon finds the right blade . 
i give this num_num stars ,  but some of the plates were a bit warped upon receipt . 
the bowl and parts clean easily by rinsing ,  or with a soapy washcloth . 
the whole time i was home for the holiday ,  i made foam for everyone for their morning coffee . 
this looks much nicer than using the folding method . 
even though that is a great protection for the iphone ,  that makes the phone look too big . 
other than that ,  it certainly is perfect in every way . 
a metal blade would probably lead to more mangled shrimp so it s just fine . 
i wanted something that wasnt too heavy and wouldnt break . 
these handmade pots combine form and function so beautifully . 
i like the white because you don t have to worry about the pattern being discontinued ,  which they usually are . 
these lids make a great liquid tight seal for storage in the fridge after you open a jar . 
he liked alton brown s idea of putting salt in a similar container . 
on the num_extend it powers and charges correctly . 
if you are an uncoordinated clutz or like treating your things like trash ,  this is not for you . 
very even heat distribution and they clean up with little more than a rinse . 
for a low cost purchase ,  it s a homerun !  i d buy again it these ever break . 
i nearly took off my finger tip when i didn t use the safety handle when cutting a bell pepper . 
i wash it in the dishwasher top section .

he has had it for two months and is so far very happy with it . 
this trivet is very pretty but is smaller than i thought it would be . 
it very nice looking and makes the best pot of coffee i ve had in years . 
however this is a great product that applies easily . 
one  convenient  feature is an auto zero function . 
these headphones are very rare in my city  medellin ,  colombia  ,  and if they could buy ,  they are very expensive . 
for the price i thought i would be getting a basic thin cheap product . 
i also like the tight profile that doesn t add much bulk to my iphone . 
farberware continues to be a superb cookware product . 
we bought one for our new home and we love it .

i bought this for my soon to be brother in law . 
it also has a usb port on the back of it for other usage .

this wall mount was our solution and we had a perfect spot for it . 
this was the biggest i could find that fit my drawer . 
i have had it for about a month now and it is the best corer i have had . 
contrasted to web shopping prices ,  their discounted prices offered no real benefit .

i think its far better than the ones i paid over $
i was not sure what to expect ,  but this product delivers . 
once i see the oil  shimmer  i add food . 
items are sturdy ,  will last ,  very pleased with these items . 
but then we just decided dammit ,  we re getting steak knives . 
while they paired up perfectly ,  they sounded much too tinny and felt cheap . 
i used the little card that it came with to smooth the bubbles out of it . 
i know this is a good quality knife as are all wusthof kitchen products . 
they hold them at just above ear level .

my wife saw this on america s test kitchen . 
before i bought this i read many reviews about it not fitting ,  being too small and of poor quality . 
i ve had the hero for about a year now and i couldn t be happier . 
that s simply because the capacity on this pack is so high that it takes longer to recharge . 
if it doesn t work when i get the phone i ll update the review . 
thanks for the product and especially for making it affordable . 
all of the shapes except the diamond and the eight pointed star work very well .

only drawback ,   small  is the fill marks are very hard to distinguish . 
the cord is a bit shorter but it works fine for me .

the wood is a bit lighter weight than i would have liked  for appearances . 
the end is rather smushy ,  and easily stripped . 
the fit to the ear is very num_extend
the only down side is the trays wear out over time .

 we all regret that this company shifted much of their production from germany to china in recent years . 
i m not one to write product reviews ,  but this bt deserves some comments . 
the stainless steel is nice and heavy ,  which i associate with good stainless steel . 
they both came with extra rings as well . 
i usually put my phone in my pocket and this didn t snag . 
i tend to be a little clumsy and drop things a lot . 
they should use the design from their commuter case which stays closed . 
i also needed time getting use to the weight being noticeably heavy towards the bottom . 
the more you use it ,  the better it will get . 
i ve grated cheese ,  made mayonnaise ,  marinara sauces ,  and more . 
i measure it and i get usually a jump from % to % of humidity in my room . 
it lays completely flat ,  unlike leather pocket pouches that generally retain the shape of the device . 
my only regret is that i didn t purchase a slightly bigger one . 
now it s neat and tidy and the pocket is great for storing the paddle attachment . 
but when i started  heating up  in bed last nite ,  this thing really works . 
it s a bit of an eye sore in my opinion . mountek was very prompt in addressing my problem . 
i have a handheld knife sharpener and it was doing okay ,  but i needed something easier and more powerful . 
they are sturdy ,  ikea quality ,  they will last years . 
this spoon looks and feels pretty sturdy ,  so i shouldn t be disappointed . 
also ,  the shield washes up easily and comes out like new .

no ,  it doesn t perform well in bright sunlight ,  but virtually nothing else does either . 
it s small ,  easy to use ,  and holds my phone at just the right angle for watching videos ,  etc . 
however ,  this only happened during the first time  hopefully  i plugged in the brewer . 
it ll flex and vibrate ,  but it won t shatter . 
in some locations ,  this resulted in a slight increase in signal . 
for red wines kept in room temperature ,  one day is usually the most you can expect . 
adds a lot of bulk but it s manageable and still fits in your front pocket . 
it is not very functional in a small pan . 
first ,  the problems with the instructions :  as another reviewer mentioned ,  the illustrations in the instructions indicate improper facings . 
the switch for turning it on is very easy to deal with . 
i have easy access to all the buttons ,  etc . 
i was expecting it to charge slower since it s double ,  but it doesn t .

the size is nice and compact so it s not another huge gadget to store . 
the set up was easy and it s not a big deal for me to reverse the fan to vent . 
all in all for $ a good deal . 
veritcally ,  it should hold about num_num dvd s ,  num_num cds  stacked two rows vertically each shelf  . 
it fits the hand and palm comfortably ,  unlike the kaf s wood handle  not to mention its totally blunt edge  . 
very useful in the kitchen ,  easy to clean and sturdy . 
the mesh is not all that fine ,  that s kind of a vague way to describe it . 
everything gets greasey splatters ,  as does the surface you have it on . 
i had been eyeing it since i heard about it on a tech show . 
very comfortable in the hands but it gets tiring after a while . 
i liked it so well that i bought a num_extend one for my wife . 
may she rest in peace once i buy a new phone . 
i brought several of these and they work well . 
i can get into corners tht my big vacuum misses . 
it fits the iphone num_extend perfect and does not interfere with my clear sheet protector . 
how do you tell calphalon to go to hell ?  on amazon i guess . 
just be careful when using because it is very sharp . 
may not be as accurate as digital clocks ,  but it does the job intended . 
that s it !  during that time ,  i m putting together whatever i m having with the coffee ,  dessert ,  breakfast etc . 
this pan is a little bigger than i thought as well . 
i even bought one as a gift for my cousin . 
they fit so perfectly on your phone its as if you don t have them . 
we love this press ,  it works great for garlic and ginger ,  really cool too . 
this item appeared online as a lighter color . 
i did have an extension  usb on each end  ,  that makes it practical . best use . 
i usually always nick a nail when peeling with my old peeler . 
he and i highly recommends this to all knives specialists to improve the slicing ability of your knives . 
bought this for my wife who s had num_num jabra bluetooth headsets of the same inconspicuous design . 
after cooking num_num frozen pizza shells overflowing with my veggie toppings ,  i must say this is an excellent product . 
i have a fancier one ,  but this is the one that i always come back to . 
i wanted the all american but couldn t handle the price right now . 
so no scratches on the screen ,  but unattractive indentations in it s place . still i m happy with the product over all . 
so there s no hepa filters ,  or bagless ,  or retractable cord or fancy light or carpet beating head . 
num_num minutes will fully charge the battery ,  and you get num_num hours of talk time . 
i think it was well worth the price . 
the small glasses are wider than the tall glasses and hold a lot more than expected . 
great for creating snacks for work or for a fruit plate . 
i like it a lot . one disadvantage is that it is a little bulkey . 
less than num_num cups is not quite as good in my opinion . 
i get compliments on them all the time !  . 
the cable allows me to charge both my phone and the spare battery at the same time . 
the light is designed to be in sight of a normal height person doing other stuff nearby . 
i like the spacing on the curved cutter . 
the numbers are large and easy to read without my glasses . 
my only drawback from giving them num_num stars is that the funnel is plastic . 
this item came packaged well and had everything it was supposed to have in it . 
i bought this slicer for my girlfriend ,  after we saw a similar device being demonstrated at a local retailer . 
that s all i have to say about this new vaccum . 
i purchased this back in num_num and also purchased two additional trays . 
i ve only used this pillow for one night but it seemed pretty comfortable . 
attach the ac adapter to the base and plug it in . 
and when they are new they look great as well . 
charger wasn t exactly as pictured :  charger shown at time of order was white ,  item received was black  improvement ?   . 
its the right size for me since i live alone . 
haven t had to use the new battery yet ,  hope it is in working order when i do . 
have burnt it once  left it on stove too long while boiling an artichoke  . 
we use botanic garden as our every day dining set as we have done for quite a few years . 
comes with an applicator and a little cloth . 
i usually fill one with dinner leftover ,  and the other with cut fruit pieces . 
however ,  my motorola num_extend is more comfortable and my callers understand me better . 
i ve used this can opener for the last couple of years and love it . 
i found this one for a reasonable price and went for it . 
however ,  now that i ve used it more ,  the bowl really annoys me . 
great if you keep it in your purse instead of jeans !  . 
if anyone s interested num_extend round parchment circles make a perfect base liner . 
coffee grinds shoot out ,  all over the counter . but i will sacrifice a small mess for a quality grind  :   . 
these dishes are light and easy to stack ,  so putting the dishes away is much easier now . 
great for either stove top or oven roasting . 
when you press down hard ,  the motor reverses with a loud clacking noise ,  and you think you ve broken it . 
this case was being sold num_num times more in other stores and it s the same exact case ! love !  !  . 
drink coffee from it every morning and i love this purchase just a little bit more with every sip !  . 
for most home cooks ,  i think the num_num inch knife is the best choice . 
but it does a great job ,  and i save alot of money . 
great ,  no more hunting around for the parts you need to use your cuisinart . 
the stylus is a little shorter than those standard pens . the tip is really satisfying . 
it should be workable on a wet stone in the same way that knives and other blades are . 
i put my food on it ,  insert in the oven and then turn it on . 
my old salad shooter s shredding cone finally cracked after many years of hard service grating block cheese and vegetables . 
i used it for everything from chopping veggies to carving meat . 
bought a pair of gloves to keep the slicing a little safer . 
i put an oven bag in the pulp bin so that that is easier too ,  although that isn t necessary . 
maybe there s a reason for it ,  but i haven t found it . 
i have not tried to make potatoe pancakes yet ,  but i am looking forward to that too . 
it really can be used for almost anything . 
i thought it may be a cheap like the rest of them .  .  .  . i was so surprised !  very nice quality !  . 
a white trimmed version would have been perfect . 
otherwise it really dries out the house too . 
i have shared the items with a few of my friends and we are very happy with the item . 
if you hammer your meat with it ,  it will pulverize it . 
they are so much handier to use and store than the num_num piece canning lids and rings . 
the basket was bent during shipping ,  but it is flexible and was relatively easy to bend back into shape . 
i would not be able to use the original jabra charger with this setup . 
my kenmore died after a long period of use and i bought this from amazon warehouse . 
needed a great price and quick delivery and i got it !  . 
i just rinse and wipe ,  along the grain ,  using a sponge . 
the battery has to be charged and discharged a few times before the extra life kicks in . 
did i mention that it looks good too ?  . 
great price ,  and look forward to using  folds nicely also !   . 
in my case ,  i gave my wife the mixer and kids gave her the cover . 
not a great toaster , but does a good job and is excellent for everything else . 
we are hard on any machine ,  just due to the amount of use . 
this little gizmo made canning a cinch this year . 
i bought this because my old tool was old and beginning to build up some rust . 
very surprised no one sells single ones any more makes sense for music and phone maybe more phone . 
it is fantastic for creating a nice browning on chicken ,  pork ,  steak ,  etc . 
i have recommended this one to others in my family . 
i couldn t do it without these tools and believe me ,  i tried . 
this toaster received some of the best reviews including ,  but not often mentioned comments on toasting . 
so with all of that to draw upon ,  i began to get nervous . 
however ,  in my opinion ,  it s too tall for every day use . 
there is no rubber ear seal that was invariably the source of initial unit wear degradation . e . 
it is the right length to sit in a medium to large size saucepan on the stove . 
no need for a measuring cup ! after washing the strainer ,  i recommend hanging or standing it upright to dry . 
it is on the expensive side but the pain relief is worth it . 
no need for frosting as this cake s design is so lovely . 
makes your salad looks beautiful . i would recommend this product . 
it damaged my foot on the bounce more than it was damaged . 
i used that pan for just about everything including roasting a chicken in . 
this is unfortunatly my second experience with this great product . 
much neater than a squeeze bear ,  a dipper ,  or a pitcher . 
the machine itself light without sacrificing any sort of power . 
i purchased this grinder a long time ago for the coffee mess . 
in several reviews i noticed people recommending getting an additional knob for the lid and spring . 
over the years i convinced anyone who would listen to me to buy one . 
love the machine; am so glad i can make our family homemade ice cream again !  . 
i m not saying these are the heaviest things in the world ,  just they are not weak little cheap pans . 
will it protect it if you drop it in water ?  again .  .  . i doubt it . 
i like the safety function that prevents it from starting to run when it s first plugged in . 
try light pressure until your machine produces the coffee taste you like . 
this is a absolute necessity for smart phone owners . 
i don t think that will happen with these . 
it  hugs  the phone really nicely and will definitely protect it . 
the sturdy steel makes lifting even a full load no problem . 
this stove looks like a smaller version of the one in the farm house . 
and it s pretty touch to scratch it as well . 
i have used this bread pan several times to make french bread . 
i ordered this to go with the other pieces that i have sitting out on my counter . 
very slim case best used by people store their iphones in trouser pockets . 
finally got a chance to use this when we had some precise temp requirements on a fried recipe . 
it s fast ,  smooth ,  and never drops a call . 
you know how most spatulas are ,  even the expensive ones . 
the phone will fit in it with no case ,  but it is very tight . 
this guy is a great gift giver !  ! it has been my faithful and trusty sidekick for nearly num_num years . 
it works ,  it is sturdy ,  and it is shiny . 
it takes the sound produced by your iphone speakers and focuses is like a . 
i would have spent more money ,  but i am glad i did not have to . 
the bowl ,  however ,  had long since seen better days . 
i would have given my old zojirushi num_num stars and so far this one deserves a little higher . 
they supply labels but not for the most common spices which is ok . 
so i decided to ad another global knife to my collection and i selected this one . 
my old blender had push buttons which i could never really get clean . 
i think its too big for my coleman camp stove . 
delivered on time with a partial charge ,  in case you needed it . 
i had been looking a very long time for a tenderizer that penetrated the meat ,  without smashing it . 
they are quite thin ,  which is fine for the daily commute or similar . 
the hang up button is well positioned in the center of the handle and works well . 
bought extra ,  but found i didn t need them !  love the extra space on the grating to put bigger pots . 
i think it s great ,  steady base that doesn t slide around and holds a good amount of soap . 
this is a great can opener and the hum is not so loud as most others i ve heard . 
that is until i found my goofy and apparently ,  very hungry german shepherd eating my linguini !  . 
glad to see harold imports still has the right size . 
i ve received many home canned goodies so it was a gift to me as well . 
it creates much better heat for cooking with a wok ,  they way it is in intended . 
i checked out amazon website to see what s available and came across this one . very pleased with the purchase . 
it s so much better than plugging with the usb cord . 
this is a pretty good set of cutting boards . 
that said ,  it certainly will not protect against much of an impact to the front . 
it s just as well ,  in fact preferable ,  that the forward and reverse don t work . 
i use it num_extend a week and a few extra hours in between for making and taking calls . 
the bread comes out just right every time . 
the copper in it is minimal ,  and is mostly hype .  .  . but it is still a great little pot . 
these chopsticks are pretty good for the price . 
they were here before christmas and they were very easy to setup . 
it s a nice case with several design options . 
as other reviewers have explained ,  this electric teakettle does an excellent job of boiling water in a jiffy . 
there were two other comments that i noted in some of the product reviews . 
this is one of the few products that i can say changed my life !  i am a soaker . 
i tried switching audio to my phone and that did not work either . 
i ve had it for about a year now and have had no issues whatsoever . 
a friend told me about this and i got it . 
i have nothing bad to say about this spinner . 
oxo has always done me good and i didn t have any hesitation purchasing something from them . 
it s soooo easy i just finished my second attempt which was quite successful . 
the product even came ahead of schedule which i appreciated it . 
i was stunned that the num_num does not include a microphone mute function on the headset . 
seems to work on hard and softer cheese with equal ease . 
the packing was exceptional and everything arrived as hoped . 
it is plastic but seems sturdy enough and it s been about num_num months now with absolutely no problems . 
i like it a lot ,  and have ordered another . 
carefully pour the water out and add more water . 
also ,  there won t be a danger of it falling down ,  unlike some organizers that are secured via fasteners . 
i use the blackberry mostly to keep abreast of what s going on while away from those primary computing tools  . 
i then blended the raspberries in my vitamix and strained the seeds out of the mixture with cheesecloth . 
i would buy another one of these tomorrow if mine went out  although it will probably outlive me !   . 
adjustable ,  removable ,  almost anywhere mountable ,  and most enjoyable . 
i know this device is a compromise in utility . 
don t want to talk on the phone while driving without some sort of hands free device . 
i wanted this for the blender that i had . 
just one piece out of this would cost you $ at the mall ,  you can t beat the price here . 
i knew that it was for beating things ,  such as eggs ,  whipped cream ,  and unruly children . 
the unit itself has a very nice feel and is very light in weight . 
don t buy any of these systems for fm transmission as that is not very good quality . 
the charger which comes with the galaxy num_extend is a num_extend amp charger . 
this is not a cool gadget ,  but an essential tool for busy cooks . 
i bought these for cookie scooping ,  thinking they d be smaller . 
i m back on soy ,  but won t be going back to those sprays . 
i find these to be a very nicely made set . 
frozen bean will also likely to shatter into much smaller pieces ,  and these smaller fragments will clog your portafilter . 
however ,  after several days my music says its not supported and won t play . 
this strainer is flexible and does what it is supposed to do . 
i just used bisquick mix ,  and of the num_num years i had it ,  waffles always popped out without sticking . 
i would unhesitatingly recommend this product to a friend . 
this yields a wonderful crunchy toasted surface which is critical to the mcmuffin experience . 
never loved cast iron in the past ,  but this is great . 
not to mention it wasn t a cute color . 
you can take it off and wash it which is great ,  i have a two year old ,  and well . 
my only complaint is that it is made out of black vinyl instead of leather as described . 
i really like crusty edges and hit on the rectangular four square pizza at a detroit area chain . 
calls are clear and range is not as good as my old jawbone num_extend but good enough . 
the num_num inches length is excellent ,  not to long ,  not too short . 
i will review it after the holidays when she uses it . 
voice calls ,  gps directions and music ,  all sounded excellent . 
other brands i have tried don t stay on my ear !  . 
the num_num presets make it very convenient to push a button and let the blender to its thing . 
it even curls the lemon peel if you like to make fancy desserts or drinks . 
i have docked it a star since it is not as accurate in it s performance given the size mismatch . 
i doubted my skills as a decorator because of wilton tips . 
they are durable and keep their color if hand washed . 
it is best for small chopping jobs and i like the drainage paths on the sides . 
i m one of those weird people that need background noise to sleep . 
one for snapping photos and one for recording . 
the original corningware cookware hasn t been manufactured since the late num_extend after the brand was sold to another company . 
i have never had any problems with this product at all . 
so ,  while i will have to test with fruits ,  cheese ,  and other dairy ,  i m pleased with this so far . 
this personal coffeemaker lasts years and costs next to nothing . 
with this mount ,  i have not issues because of the shape of the brackets . 
i m told by the coffee drinkers in the family that freshly ground beans are the only way to go . 
i couldn t believe how sharp this bread knife is . 
worth the price if your looking to protect your phone from light drops or surface wear . 
mine do work but then again ,  i have had them for only a few days . 
this is a very versatile book stand that is easy to carry around and easy to store . 
i bought this to use with my new mr . 
it feels just like a zagg invisibleshield ,  for almost half the price . 
unfortunately ,  when turning the timer knob ,  it cracked and broke . 
i will order this same case again once i feel the need to change the case up a bit . 
i use these filters in my camper ,  home and furnished rental homes . 
so i decided it was time to spend the extra $
this is a handy gadget that makes cleaning tile a breeze . 
this is a canner you want for meats . 
works well in office where the charger points are far away .  . or in toilet as well . 
faster than the desire ,  wildfire and motorola droid num_extend
as good or better than most sub $ wired headsets i ve listened to . 
i m glad i have it in my kitchen . 
i have no battery worries at all no matter how long my day is . 
we have all three sizes of these containers ,  and they are great . 
i have used it about num_num times now and the finer mesh screen captures most of the splatters well . 
would recommend if you do any decorating at all . 
it has a counter balance tip that holds the lid securely so it does not slip . 
he spent days trying to get mine to work with his to try it out and it wouldn t work . 
truly ,  this is the best suction i have seen . 
takes a lot of flour on the inside . 
anything with a filter  car ,  air conditioner etc .   requires a little maintenance . 
this case fits very snug and i really like the rubberized feel . 
therein lies the difference between mineral oil and boos block mystery oil . 
the openings in the bottom and top are placed perfectly . 
definitely worth the current price here on amazon to clear out half of my utensil drawer . 
they are plastic with a hole in the top that acts as a port for the vacuum hose attachment . 
i have baked bread ,  fried ,  deep fried ,  stewed ,  braised ,  and boiled in this pot . 
the iphone  verizon  fits well in it and it wasn t too hard to put on . 
multiple uses in the kitchen you can t go wrong . 
works well ,  seems like the original product ,  good quality material . great deal on amazon . 
all i wanted was a grinder that would grind my beans fresh for a good cup of coffee . 
the family decided we liked the white and cobalt blue so we bought half of each color . 
you can not beat this product for this price . 
the best part is that i have num_num of them . 
is very durable and one piece construction makes using a snap . 
works just like my old trusty ge knife ,  but noticeably quieter . 
i still have them almost a year later . 
and now ,  after a bit over num_num years ,  it s a dead unit . 
a pizza cutter isn t something you think about all that often until you need one . 
after the holidays i made ham stock and it turned out great . 
works perfectly for my num_extend and long enough for my outlet that is too far away . 
i know you re probably thinking num_extend bucks for a paper towel holder ?  !   ,  because that s what i thought . 
tap it on the bowl to clear out any vegetable . 
it was only recently that i decided to come to amazon to see if they were available to buy . 
less noisy than not having an attachment there ,  and num_extend
i think you can put it in the dishwasher but i never do . 
after it s hot ,  apply whatever grease you like . 
i don t like to store in plastic ,  so these are perfect . 
this is an amazingly simple device that works well for all sizes of knives . 
i find these headphones to be very comfortable and i have a large head . 
it works well ,  and after making one pot that was a little weak i got the hand of it . 
i was considering buying a second one in case something happens to the first . 
charges the phone fairly quickly and lasts just as num_extend
these shears will cut anything and are very sturdy . 
very sturdy; easy to open and seal lids; doesn t take a lot of space in the fridge . 
this griddle seems like a commercial quality piece . 
i love this braun kettle ,  we use it for mainly making coffee with our chemex coffee maker . 
these bags are great ,  but wish they can with ties . 
i choose it as a good middle ground on cost . 
marble base makes it even easier highly recommend . 
keep the manual handy to help you get that thing on correctly . 
our only concern over time is the small plastic clip that holds the dust tray to the main machine . 
most people who have seen it seems to be enamored with its design and form factor . 
the dustbuster just has so much more suction ! overall ,  it s an outstanding hand vac at a great price . 
does almost everything well and looks good doing it . 
these are great for packs or emergency bags and the hook sharpener is an extra plus . 
they recommended adding cream and sugar to the mug before brewing ,  which works great . 
only drawback is since its so sharp you need to watch peeling yur knuckle by accident . 
it works great ! very satisfied with the quality of the dualit . 
this is particularly important when her turntable is operating ,  especially if the stand is touched during num_extend cable management . 
i don t know how i survived without it . 
also no little alligator on top of lid as pictured . 
i can t say enough good things about these containers . 
if you want commercial grade pans ,  then these are not for you . 
i did a lot of research before picking this up . 
i like them because there really isn t much excess material . 
get two or three ,  you ll be glad you did . 
assembly was easy and everything worked great on the first try . 
it is lightweight and easy to use and very sharp . 
great price for these replacement rolls for the food saver . 
i ve obviously cleaned it here and there ,  but everything is still in  like new  condition . 
they fit both this headset and my ears perfectly . 
this little fryer does what it s supposed to do . 
i believe if you re serious about cooking ,  you should own great cookware and excellent knives . 
it still works ,  but the battery no longer last more than a few hours . 
i have had none of these problems . i adore my roomba . 
this is my first breadmaking machine . i am no expert on mixing and makingbread . 
the tip about using a leather glove on the hand you have inside the garment is essential . 
i use it for work when i go on my breaks . 
other devices are difficult to clean and require extra storage . 
i read about num_extend reviews of the leading toasters from many sources . 
lotza people have asked where i got this ! i want to get more of them to organize my pantry . 
this charger is very small and very light . 
i know of no easy way to remember to do so before discarding an old wick . 
it s not perfect but for a cheap way to hold your phone upright ,  it does a good job . 
the clams also came out great without the mess . 
does exactly what it should by helping to cook evenly . 
the double blades are nice and sharp ,  and it powers through whatever job i set it to . 
this blender is so easy to use and so virsital . 
i then included one suncution cup with each suncatcher in the gift package . 
it s a big ear piece and initially i was going to send it back . 
i really don t have the time to iron all our clothes so this was an investment for me . 
however ,  the num_extend  functionality  buttons are very cramped . 
it is really good compared to the last headset i had and i would recommend it to anyone . 
i m a culligan water filer owner so i buy these replacement filters for it . 
easy to work and has a good grip . 
first off i do want to say that i purchased this as a not so everyday buyer . 
i am thinking of poking the holes out to make it easier to push the buttons . 
i priced them in the stores and was kind of put off . 
i use it while skyping on my mac and the sound is clear on both ends . 
a little bit of a pain getting the tea into it ,  but not too bad . 
i could have gone with the newer digital ,  but for the extra $ it didn t add that much value . 
i purchased two of these after using one at a friends house and plan to buy more for gifts . 
i ve used this grill for about a month now and cooked everything from meat to fish to veggies . 
out of all the spatulas i own ,  these are the ones i always reach for . 
when i first plugged this into my bose and iphone num_extend i got the incompatible message . 
we baked two pies in it and it did a great job . 
i saw this at a friend s house and decided to buy one myself . 
i could hear a cyclist coming up behind me rolling over the fallen leaves . 
don t expect anything more than that and you will be happy . 
the pan also cleans up wonderfully !  we have never had a probelm with anything sticking . 
i can say to use all butter before adding new butter on top . 
one of the best cutting knives i have ever had . 
it is faster than any phone i ve ever had . 
if you fail to make a tight seal a few drops of water will escape before it seats itself . 
i did without an electric can opener for over a year !  couldn t stand struggling to open cans manually . 
cleans just fine and the color choices are good ,  got the vanilla and the red one . 
it is very easy to put on and take off too . 
it neatly pushed the peels out ,  and i put them through again to eke out just a little more . 
i bought the white model knowing i d use my white iphone headphones . 
no guesswork ,  no  hmm ,  maybe this one needs a little more  . 
i am so in awe of the results ! arrived promptly and in good shape . 
dell really did a amazing job of this phone ,  can not wait to see new windows phones from them . 
i m delighted all over again each time i use it . 
it picks up kitty litter and dry cat food kibble with ease . 
for $ this is really a great purchase . 
if i were working with a more malleable dough  not chocolate chip  ,  this problem may not occur . 
i have a htc phone and this works great . 
only think i would recommend is using a lighter cake in them ,  than chocolate . 
i would buy another if i change phones . 
this is a great product to mount your phone to your car window . 
i also steam fish ,  make rice porridge and soup in mine . 
it is constructed of heavy duty ,  vinyl coated metal . 
a few swipes at the correct angle is all that s needed to hone the edge before using the knife . 
i recommend it for someone who wants a quick cuppa to go ,  with little hassle . 
these are solid little measuring cups and seem like they should last years . 
it is compact ,  good looking and provides easy access to all of the ports and buttons on the iphone . 
built from commercial grade thickness sheet metal with are very durable ,  non stick surface . 
the only concern i have is ,  the volume is rather low even at the highest setting . 
people hear me fine ,  and i hear them fine . 
built from commercial grade thickness sheet metal with a very durable ,  non stick surface . 
the current release is still num_extend which fixed all the initial huge problems . 
we ,  once again ,  have the most flavorful coffee . 
the store i was at knew its business . 
yes ,  it s heavy and that is a good thing . 
i had admired this type of trashcan at others  homes ,  and have wanted one for some time . 
fits perfect and looks just like a bumper from apple . 
you seldom see instructions that clear these days . 
magnetic spice containers was on her xmas list . 
also not a  made in china  so that right there is huge for me . 
great for keeping rolls or biscuits warm before dinner . 
the protector was noticeably thicker but it does protect your phone . 
when i pulled out the battery  drawer  to investigate and pushed it back in ,  it worked fine . 
bought it as a gift for my lady friend and she absolutely loves it . 
also ,  the error message shouldn t hinder the function of the booster . 
this repeated the next num_num days . my friends are now going to buy this for num_extend
this is an excellent little item ,  when you just want one cup of coffee . 
the maximum liquid capacity is not more than num_num cups . 
i didn t want a waffle maker with a bulky flip stand to store . 
my previous round glass thermometer cracked ,  this one seems more sturdy so hopefully it won t . 
the phone does not have any trouble fitting in my pocket . 
wish it was teflon coated but i ll take it as is . 
ideal cooking aid for a couple ,  perhaps too small for a family of more than two . 
it has been the most useful kitchen appliance next to my braun multimix . 
the case actually provides room to wear the phone itself doesn t touch whatever is laying on . 
probably a little less crash protection compared to silicone too due to lower compression ,  but no num_extend
when it arrived i immediately cleaned all my carpets and was amazed at the results . 
for earbuds ,  the quality of sound is excellent . 
it doesn t feel cheap like other cases . i will recommend this to family and friends . 
i researched several options for shelving to use to display small items on a bookcase shelf . 
in fact it looked like it was many years old ,  very boxy and huge chunky buttons . 
 :   looking forward to do some zucchini noodles with it !  . 
i used them with the wilton mini cupcake pans for both muffins and cupcakes . 
properly heated on the grill ,  it leaves nice grill marks . 
after doing research ,  i decided to buy one decent knife to go with the knife set gifted to us . 
it is clear ,  compact and easy to use and clean . 
this setup was simple ,  the device finds a station to use on its own . 
used this pan the next day after it arrived . 
i didn t realize how spoiled until i decided to replace my set with something new and modern . 
if this happens ,  though ,  it may be a sign of improper  and potentially dangerous  use . 
it is not dissimilar to having a grill on the stove top . 
i ve had this mixer for four years going on five years . 
fits the iphoneand works for a few hours when neededeasy to recharge tooi have no complaints . 
little to no noise distortion at high volume . 
the best dinner was eckridge sausage ,  potatoes ,  and broccoli ,  all done in the steamer . 
it took a few minutes to reach temp . 
my son is learning to cook and wants to cook more in college this year . 
in college i was on a tight budget and i purchased this wonderful benriner mandolin slicer . 
i made mozzarella both times and have yet to try making ricotta . 
granted they aren t extended life ,  but these little guys work out great when traveling . 
dust gets in and water could get in too . 
it works like a charm and i can reuse the glass jars over and over . 
screens ,  however ,  tend to be exceedingly hard to apply ,  and this one from amazon is no exception . 
these cutters have sharp edges and i love the various sizes . 
i was leary because other people said this broke too quickly . 
i purchased one for each of our vehicles and i highly recommend . 
took me all of num_num seconds and it was done . 
not fancy ,  and i wouldn t have a heart attack if one got lost . 
once the pan is heated it stays heated and your food stays hot longer and evenly . 
very highly recommended ,  if your are just starting out in life . 
my num_extend also recognized it within num_num seconds . 
you will not be disappointed with this one . 
i used the egg noodle recipe for fettuccine from the book . 
love the size ,  and the fact that it can go in the frig ,  the oven or on the stove . 
i ve only used it twice but it quickly charged the phone both times . 
but two and a half year is easily num_num bowls of rice . 
we charge a samsung and iphone using this outlet . 
it also does a good job at chopping salads ,  cutting sandwiches in half ,  and dicing stuff up . 
i purchased three of these pumps for shampoo ,  conditioner ,  and body wash for my new shower . 
i usually make it right after dinner and then the next day s breakfast is all but prepared . 
we like to squeeze lemons into our water and the cheap ones kept breaking . 
you need to put it away in a drawer when your not using it . 
the color is gorgeous !  i would absolutely buy more cases like this in different colors . 
cookies practically levitate off the sheet and onto the cooling rack . 
i do not find it hard to clean as some claim . 
it arrived on time and it fits the iphone num_extend perfectly . 
after reading an article about bpa i wanted to replace my old plastic cutting boards . 
i ve suffered in the winter also  i suspect from mould  . 
the num_extend also sports bluetooth num_extend so you can use a wireless bluetooth keyboard and mouse simultaneously . 
farberware has always had a reputation for quality and this pot does not disappoint . 
i love it !  !  it fits great and i get a lot of compliments on it . 
these bright red stalks will react with an aluminum pan as acidic fruits do . 
in the garden it also has tons of uses . 
you only need to cook over a low setting as this pan will heat up very quickly . 
stainless steel with rubberized handles ,  you would really have to work at it to damage or bend these cups . 
the case is well padded and closes magnetically ,  providing excellent protection for the headset . 
this pin has been nothing but a pleasure to use . 
i bought one of these models ,  used ,  num_num years ago ,  and it is still working just like new . 
my only complaint is that the carafe doesn t have a sealed lid . 
beautiful jars . have used them many times and gave some as gifts . would highly recommend to others . wish i had more . 
very pleased to find the exact one that came with my phone  samsung giii  ,  and for a great price . 
it is a tight fit ,  but it is not too tight if you just have this stuff . 
i should be able to use these for a long time to come . 
i got this when we got a new tv . 
the difficulty in cooking with marinades is the advanced planning and time required . 
for me i am setting it to one size for cutting home made bread . its perfect . 
i didn t do it the second time and the metal wouldn t contact the phone sim slot pins properly . 
it s not a product problem ,  it s an owner problem . 
it took a bit to be release ,  but it doesn t disappoint . 
i also sliced a num_num pound eye of round beef roast for jerky . 
i have made milk shacks ,  smoothies ,  ices ,  marinades and frozen drinks already and just had it for two weeks . 
it doesn t have a hand guard or a slot . 
no damage to phone ,  screen or case .  .  . as i said before excellent product !  . 
they are good for lights you want to use year round and not just for the holidays . 
they easily fit inside one another for minimal storage consumption . 
as others have mentioned in their reviews ,  you will need to sharpen several of the knives upon receiving them . 
problem with the others is it is too easy to crack the glass and replacements are not cheap . 
thank you for selling the product ,  i would recommend this to anyone that need a good replacement screen . 
although its not as good ,  its a lot easier to use . 
these pots are top quality stainless steel and are a pleasure to cook with . 
i bought the bread machine magic recipe book at the same time vol . 
very well designed and they stack pretty well for storage . 
i don t use the fm function because the speaker is fine and this really makes my phone navigation useful . 
i bought this to make chicken and dumplings from scratch for thanksgiving and it did the job . 
however ,  these accessories are great coupled with the power and efficiency of the mixer . 
they fit well ,  look nice and are very affordable . 
these seem to work better with women s pant . overall really great and would buy again when more is needed . 
i agree with everything people said about making great coffee . 
the perfect lemon zester :  nothing more ,  nothing less . 
the holmes dual fan i have in the kitchen has been running steadily without a glitch for four years . 
it s built well ,  but it s not an industrial machine . 
i really wish they hadn t changed it so many times . 
however ,  the brew still looked different vs the krups . 
really ,  there is no wiggle room at all . 
it said nothing about the fact that the slider rods and the shelf have top and bottom sides . 
this one gets stuck on your underwear or pans or belt when you try to pull it off . 
i had been using an electric tea kettle with satisfactory results for the last num_num months . 
i put one on my phone about num_num months ago and you can t even tell . 
i even use it as a small colander , slot spoon and skimmer . 
the six places that snap onto the back seem like they re ripe for coming loose or undone . 
all my knives have benefited from this simple contraption . 
it still looks brand new and is just awesome !  we highly recommend it !  totally happy with purchase !  . 
this wall charger is a nice design that supports mini and micro usb connections . 
first of all ,  this thing is solid and heavy . 
for whatever technical reason ,  this stovetop percolator produces a full and robust cup of coffee . 
i purchased the optional hardwood floor attachment and this machine does a great job cleaning our linoleum . 
but works great on potatoes carrots cucumbers and the such . 
now that i ve got it out of my system ,  on to the actual product review . 
it s very thin ,  a lot smaller than my otter box . 
i wish the rubber piece could be purchased separately in different colors . 
cleans up easily with a damp paper towel . 
will definitely continue to buy this item as needed !  . 
i looked at many without the handle ,  but decided it was best to have one . 
i use it at my desk when making skype calls . 
the earbuds will not aggravate your ears when they are in . 
they were sold out of otter boxes so i figured i d try this one since it was cheap enough . 
some of the cheap ones are just awful . 
but it s larger than what i had so it s a keeper . 
the motor speed turns the cylinder faster than most of the models that seem to grind on and on . 
this is my second one and i love it . 
i have very small hands and the bluetooth is small itself . 
if you have animals ,  children ,  or sensitive ears in the early morning . 
i have a new beetle and the stuff in my trunk was always getting lost in the cracks . 
other than the spraying tube getting clogged once this thing is awesome . 
i m the only one with this kind of cover . 
it s great to be able to charge two items at once . the plug seems nice and secure in the socket . 
it was about $  part + shipping  to replace . 
great sound on my end though ,  and it holds a charge pretty well too . 
i might add i do use them for tea in the evening . 
i use a wonderful espresso infinity burr grinder and i only grind what i use . 
nothing wrong with it ,  i just feel more comfortable with this kind of pots and pans . 
her husband also claimed that the smell was much better . 
the problem is ,  it s way too much !  i wish they sold less of it . 
i love how easy this holds onto my phone . 
i never imagined that a fairly inexpensive carpet shampooer could do such an incredible job . 
i finally have what i need to make a beautiful artian sp  loaf of bread . 
 i wonder if popping time is different for different brands and white or yellow corn . 
it is longer and wider than my old motorola phone but it is also thinner . 
you get num_num different connectors ,  which is cool . 
not sure if it worked though because i do not do well with repairing phones . 
this more than just a vegetable brush ,  but it s intended use is better than others on the market . 
however ,  i would not hesitate to buy these knives for a gift . 
you can find so many useful things out there to assist you . 
even the walnut on my knives is in excellent condition !  i do hand wash them though . 
i also looked at the otter box logos on the back and inside the case . 
but its stayed on and it works great . 
the potatoes don t get stuck in it when you mash them like they did in my criss cross one . 
as a side benefit ,  it cooks wonderful spaghetti and love it for making homemade soup . 
the flexibility and the spoon shape let you cleanly scoop every bit out of a pan or jar . 
no way you d ever know this by looking at it . 
the cord is more than long enough for me to use it with my windshield mount . 
i feel like the sound quality on a headset is shaky ,  at best . 
we like cure num_num ham and buy the whole ham and slice it to our desired thickness . 
i was glad to find this very large size iron skillet . 
and it was priced properly for a battery . 
does an equally good job on carpeting ,  wood floors and throw rugs . 
keeps the crust crispy and keeps the oven clean . 
we took it on a trip this summer; used in hotel and then later on ,  too . 
it isn t durable enough to protect the phone ,  in the event of dropping it on a concrete sidewalk . 
it is thick enough where you know it will last . 
the grip is comfortable and stable ,  and the blade is well balanced and makes a nice cut . 
keeps y our hands away from the heat . 
my first one lasted for close to a decade . 
this is easier than a push pin which is what i hoped when i got it . 
it snapped on easily ,  and all the holes were right where they were supposed to be . 
with his small lightweight speakers he is able to fully extend these with no wobble . 
for example ,  the boston globe s mobile website ,   .  .  .   ,  is very limited . 
i was going to send it back ,  but didn t get around to it right away . 
i have used at home and at our church about num_num times total . 
if you have trouble finding it ,  look by the laxatives ,  as it is used by some for that purpose . 
lets just say ,  if you own a vaporizer . 
the shutter button is hard to press without blurring the shot if you have the flash turned off . 
the treble sounds are pretty clear ,  and can hit painfully high pitches with clarity . 
the roomba num_num discovery is perfect for our bare floor needs . 
i lived without one for a few months . 
everyone who has seen me with it ,  wants to know where i got it . 
but these are exactly what he needs for everyday cooking . 
they ,  by and large ,  suffer from the same sort of problems . 
i ve owned one of these grills for a couple of days over a year now . 
i decided to give this unit a try along with a few others . what i like about this num_extend
it s strong even when wet ,  and it has no objectional or chemical odor  it just smells like cotton  . 
i was not sure what length to purchase . 
this nordic ware universal num_num cup double boiler works with pretty much every size pot i own . 
not a big issue ,  though . considering price and reliability ,  i do not hesitate to recommend purchasing this capresso grinder . 
i ve used this line of case since i bought my iphone num_extend
this product gives off a strong plastic smell when you first use it . 
i see more pieces coming in my future !  . 
it was good to be able to purchase this set . 
this is pretty easy if you have a faucet with one of those extension hoses . 
it wouldn t pair right with either phone ,  dropping the connection repeatedly . 
callendar app is very important in the biz phones . 
 :   seriously ,  be careful with that thing ! the blender makes great mixed drinks and is easy to clean . 
the  ridges  in the grill are closer together than on other devices i have used in the past . 
i look forward to using these for decades to come ,  just like their siblings . 
it doesn t take up a lot of space and looks pretty cool !  . 
volume changes on the headset does change the volume on the phone . 
i don t can often ,  and when i do ,  it s maybe num_num jars at a time . 
the quality seems ok but it seems like it might come off easily in a minor drop . 
my glass french press broke ,  due to my sink . 
the wood colors are dyed a fun bunch of shades . 
if you take care of le creuset cookware ,  you will be able to pass them down in your will . 
it works as advertised ,  easy to transfer from vehicle to vehicle and works flawless . 
the handle is made of high quality steel ,  riveted to the pan . 
once they have soaked for a few minutes ,  i removed the colander gizmo out and drained the bowl . 
i love that it swivels so i can get easily into corners . 
great case for much less than a retail store . 
i live in an old house with no yard . 
the seasoning and natural flavors are thoroughly absorbed during the cooking process . 
very repeatable both in grind size and quantity . 
i just ordered my second kitchenaid num_extend to replace the one i ve had for several years . 
it sticks well and serves its purpose as described . 
this set is nice ,  light ,  easily stored ,  and just as described . 
for the price ,  it works extremely well ,  and would hightly recommend this device to anyone !  . 
then turn on both elements and start adding the topping . 
it is very cute !  so far it is very sturdy and easily goes on the phone . 
it would be great if it were one cord instead of two but that is okay . a little expensive . 
the plastic  pen  is so light that using a metal funnel was top heavy . 
they tell you this in the manual ,  which you are suppose to read before you use it . 
but overall ,  these were a good buy for me . 
my curtain slides very easily now ,  and cannot fall out of these rings . 
yum . i highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys crispy cornbread . 
i bought the phone from the store and it had % left . 
looking very forward to cooking lots of great stuff with this great cast iron dutch oven !  recommend highly . 
this phone will not work with a  blue tooth   x link  . 
works good for mixing hot cocoa  with heavy cream of course  too . 
as i ve only just received the adapter ,  i cannot speak to durability . 
this is a comfortable bluetooth that is simple to use . 
i forgot how nice it was to talk with a regular phone in your hand . 
good ,  i like it , it does what it i want it to . 
i do not use this for smashing ice ,  only for making pastes and smoothies . 
it is a great value for the price !  . 
i have been using mine for several years already . 
definitely a must have if you don t want to scrub your microwave every two days . 
i am learning new app to use on this phone everyday . 
the comfortable rubberized handle has a nice grip too . 
they are cute and fun ,  and i would repurchase . 
we did not want to purchase a new one because the old one still works well . 
we use it to make bread dough and pizza dough . 
relatively cheap ,  solid brand ,  perfect size ,  and ease of use . couldnt be more happy . 
price is reasonable and product is a good length and quality . 
a true kitchen junkie will find a way to justify having both . 
while that may be true ,  i don t find it to be a huge deal . 
the dishes themselves are fine ,  but their packing material was lacking . 
typing sound is annoying but easily turned off . i also caution that you should probably store the batteries uninstalled . 
this is where tmobile s prepaid shines because i can do all the above with their gold rewards plan . 
the screwpull table model corkscrew arrived in a clamshell package . 
you will need a wheelbarrow ,  a level ,  and a shovel . 
i had a coffee bean grinder but that was all it was good for . 
if i can find the pet filters ,  i m hoping they will be even more effective . 
the problem was so stupid :  the previous extended battery came with a replacement door to accommodate the bigger battery . 
i have used it for cookies ,  buns ,  breads ,  stuffed pies ,  scones etc . 
the outside has a rubber feeling to it ,  hence the name . 
i was elated to find it charges a lot more with the adapters it has . 
this filled the spot exactly and is very attractive as well . 
the lady said  no problem ,  we will help  . 
i ve also used it to peel carrots ,  broccoli ,  zucchini ,  apples ,  butternut squash ,  all with success . 
i like the subtle design and the two piece fit which fits well . 
i own and cherish a num_extend i bought num_num years ago . 
the camera isn t too shabby in adequate light ,  either ,  with automatic geotagging . 
they have nice weight balance and are comfortable to hold in your hand . 
i use them with my ipod at least num_num years old  , iphone num_extend and ipad num_extend
if you don t love cast iron ,  then you don t know how to cook . 
the cases also get caught on things and the glitter falls off . 
when the switch is off ,  you are running on your iphone battery . 
the switch is a little sticky as well ,  sometimes i have to hold it on . 
what a simple idea ,  but it works well . 
dont worry about voiding the warranty you can always unroot it for warranty purposes . 
it works perfectly  ,  i receivedthe item at the time stated and at a wonderful price . 
i can fit num_num knives on it and the magnetic strength is terrific . 
this may not work for you if you have a thick screen protector  especially those made of glass  . 
the shelves are not as deep as other similar racks ,  but it works best for my situation . 
i was skeptical about bluetooth headphones ,  and have stayed away from even trying them mostly because of the price . 
i got the black first because that was the only color available when i first got my iphone num_extend
so i bought these and he s happy again . 
clean up is fine if you wash right away and of course ,  no problem if you have a dishwasher . 
again ,  this is a very minor criticism . one feature i like is that the handle conveniently folds down for storage . 
going to target would take num_num minutes from door to door . 
the water may be num_num or num_num degrees f above boiling point without bubbles . 
i am impressed with this economical tool by oxo . 
easy to use not to many buttons to worry about . 
the point being ,  i don t know if it s recommended ,  but you ve got some options out there ,  . 
i would say that it drops out on num_num in every num_num calls . 
i just fill the carafe with tap water and pour it into the coffeemaker . 
i am a vegetarian so use it quite often . 
i m hoping that i can build up an adapter plug to charge the pac from a cigarette lighter plug . 
 his two year old bread maker didn t have a timer  . 
she has been using it for over num_num years . 
i like that it was made in the usa ,  worth the extra money . 
battery is as bad ,  if not worse ,  than the num_num month old battery it replaced . 
and cleans up as if i just unwrapped it . 
i can t wait to try all the different ideas others reviewers have posted here . 
if you make casseroles for large groups ,  this larger size dish will do the trick . 
rub the chives into your pan as you fry them . 
except siri does have issues with or without handsfree . 
perfect for replacing all the mixed and mismatched jars in our spice collection . 
if i want to adjust the eq ,  i want my music player to do it . 
get a spray that is comparable to those awful aerosol spray oils that you buy at the store . 
you only need new ones once in a great while . 
i bought this to have a few extras . 
plus with the blades higher you can get underneath them better . 
these are among the better headphones i ve used on a phone . 
i can see the battery is not what it was new . 
everyone was thrilled to get them ,  and we all use them . 
mom had one of these ,  and i wanted one for my own kitchen . 
 i had read that some people felt the volume was too low when using the speakerphone . 
easy to clean and large for baking a large loaf of bread . 
this is without question ,  the absolute best of all the affordable bagless vacs i have owned . 
it seems sturdy enough so far ,  i like the different pockets . 
the connection between this motorola num_extend and my palm pixi is strong and doesn t waver . 
i bought this on a goldbox deal for $
i am going to try it with my other devices i . e . 
what can i say it does what it is suppose to . 
they due start to bend up after a while ,  but they do the job . 
i rinse some of my rices too ,  which the instructions suggest for imported rice . 
long story short ,  i hung mine using toggle bolts . 
i use them for mixing meatloaf ,  cookie dough ,  dinner roll dough and have great results . 
overall i feel as though i got much more value than i expected . 
the house was previously rented to the owner s family and his choice in flooring was the obvious landlord choice . 
i wish they had a hook or hole to hang like my others though then they would be perfect !  . 
it was scratched heavily in two places so i had doubts about it but it s pretty freakin strong . 
i dreaded the thought of having to select yet another set of dishes . 
time to change it ! now ,  how easy is that ?  . 
the design is elegant and requires no electricity and has no complex mechanical parts . 
if you are looking for the best bluetooth ,  this is the best one out there . 
we have lots of rosle kitchen products and all of them are excellent in quality and durability . 
the only downside is that the controls fails a lot . 
i would recommend it to any good cook . 
i did not pay the expedited charge ,  but it came in four days . 
for the price ,  it does this extremely well . a little loud but who cares . 
i purchased it as a gold box item and it is made and works really well . enjoy !  . 
due to so much soft fruit i had to clean the screw twice during juicing due to stoppage . 
i used to be a heavy smoker key word used to be . 
awesome that when you heat up your leftovers the glass doesn t get hot !  winning . 
it helps keep my cat room odor free . 
these glasses are great as your regular tall drinking glass . 
i like the roller ball mouse ,  which makes navigating easier . 
but i didn t like the phone without a case because it is very slippery . 
i can make a lot more fruit leather and dry sauce ect . 
they work just as expected and have a nice design to them . 
it has served my needs very well and makes some of the best stews i have ever attempted . 
i use it every day with the vinyl tablecloth protector and it has stayed clean and looking like new . 
great in the microwave ,  fridge ,  your backpack on trips ,  etc . 
after i bought him the chambord num_num cup coffee press his search is over . 
this enables to you simply chip off the inevitable drips that occur after the unit has cooled completely . 
then i poured the coffee on top of the froth . 
however ,  you do have to take care of it properly . 
washes great in the dishwasher ,  easy to grip ,  cheese comes out perfect all the time . 
this product is great !  it s compact ,  easy to use and works really well . 
connected the included num_extend audio cable from it to my car stereo . 
it s so inexpensive that i bought a spare to have on hand . 
i have had the vacuum for over a year and have noticed some good and bad points . 
strong citrus smell but gets wine and black coffee stains right out . 
march the entire vacuum outside and take note of wind direction before you remove it . 
cleaver is very easy to sharpen with a steel or a stone . 
i would recommend it to friends for sure . 
i received it as a gift from my mom about five or six years ago . 
my boyfriend bought this for me about num_num years ago and have never had a problem with it . 
i ve been able to bake hamloaf ,  paninis ,  and cookies in the oven that are baked throughly but never burnt . 
it comes with a num_extend micro sd and you can install up to num_num gb cards if you like . 
i m good at putting screen protectors on and there isn t any bubbles or anything . 
we ll have owned it for two years this december . 
will buy for another phone that i have . 
this is a great little case ,  almost on par with apple s own bumpers . 
we have used these literally hundreds of times and love them . 
these things are cheap in both sense of the word . 
i run a fair amount and it would be nice to have something that fits better . 
in the car ,  at the house ,  at the girlfriends . 
might have to get the sausage stuffer portion to try that out as well . 
my husband and i are slowly acquiring these wusthoff knives . 
this is my favorite blue tooth of all of them . 
however ,  the num_extend requires windows media player num_num for the syncing . 
it usually lasts for a couple of years and then i just get a new one . 
perfect size and holds everthing like it should . 
quick shipping ,  works well ,  and it was brand new in the bag . 
num_extend are deep knife markings on the bottom already . 
i like the durability of this case and how my bluetooth fits perfectly inside . 
they look very nice and people have said they would like them as their going away gift as well . 
works great for both and will work over any cooking surface including my alcohol emergency stove . 
just such a simple thing but it makes the whole cleaning process more maneuverable . good for projects ,  clothes ,  transport ,  whatever . 
i usually put mine in the night before i plan to use it . 
i did not have to add any extra coffee and it taste so good . 
i purchased several lifeproof cases as christmas presents . 
perfect size to sit the toaster oven on . 
i could not be happier with my rival hotpot express . 
it works as advertized and is a value for the money . 
i use it to fry bacon and stir fry . 
i was cautious about purchasing this headset because i had seen reviews from others that were not great . 
the num_num inch is made with the same high quality metal as the num_num inch too . john row . 
 had i known this would be necessary ,  it would have been much easier to have had a second pan . 
but hey ,  as long as you can hear ,  does it need to have audiophile num_extend
i have had no problems with sticking ,  except for eggs which i expected . they easily clean in the dishwasher . 
they feel weighty ,  strong ,  and sturdy ,  particularly in comparison to my old pan . 
some of the reviews made me nervous but it has met or exceeded my expectations . 
fits the phone well and also works if you have a silicone protector on the phone . 
i bought num_num of these in different colors to add to my new fiesta dinnerware . 
the price is right and the sizes and proportion are perfect for me . 
to top off the above mentioned reasons why i like this ,  the cost is also a real plus . 
it made its way around table and chair legs . 
mine still looks almost brand new after one year of usage . 
all you do is grab the top of the bottle is grip of the opener ,  and lift the arm . 
if your battery has more than two prongs just ignore all but the positive and negative prong . 
it will put the first phone on hold if need be while you answer the second . 
it s very easy to use and easy to clean . 
really ,  this is a very simple piece of equipment . 
time tested product like your mother used when you were a kid . 
got this for my nine year old nephew to use with his ipod . 
in fact ,  it feels more solid in the hand than when new ,  without a lot of additional bulk either . 
great little machine so far ! update :  i have had this machine for a year now and use it daily . 
it says on the box ,  it s enough to make num_num lbs of cheese . 
by the way ,  be sure to use a big bowl or you ll have popcorn all over your countertop . 
it sticks to the side and has to be scraped out . 
they are a heavier bowl but not difficult to handle at all . 
i ordered one to make sure it fit in my vacuum . 
saw these in a restaurant used for fajita platters and i wanted some for home . 
at first i was somewhat skeptical ,  since most similar products are significantly marked down from list price . 
nothing sticks ,  and i am amazed since i have even had cakes stick in a regular bundt pan . 
i didn t think i d ever use the ice insert but tried it and really like it . 
i have purchased several different brands of stylus and this brand is good . 
i really love this can opener ,  i wish they had it years ago . 
these are great screen protectors at a great price . 
i put the camera in and tried it out and it worked perfectly . 
i have had several mono and stereo bluetooth headsets . 
plus it has an attractive brushed stainless sheath that makes it look decent . 
this has happened on stock android in both the vibrant and num_extend that i have owned . 
just check some of the prices of older pieces on ebay . 
not sure how the reviewers managed to feel that after a day or two with the device . 
it also works with my mid num_num macbook pro . 
charging is nice and easy ,  they provide the connectors and you just add it to your charging station . 
they can still hear me ,  even with the wind noise . 
well made and smooth and sturdy during cutting . 
excellent price through amazon as always !  i would recommend these speaker stands over others listed on amazon . 
highly recommend it for your average coffee drinker . 
if your iron has already given way you will have to tape it together back into the original position . 
i have owned batteries that delivered as much or more than their rated capacity . 
only time will tell if it is durable . 
while the welded loop is very durable ,  the faberware knob looks sturdy also . 
that s basically it !  there s no case ,  no headphones ,  not even a headphone adapter . 
now that i have washed the filter a few times ,  it really needs to be replaced . 
this burr grinder has worked well for me for num_num years . 
you don t know how mush you ll use it until you get it . 
i have recommended it to everyone i know . 
i bought screen protectors for my htc evo shift from amazon . 
 it was back when i got my first one . 
nothing to get your clothes caught or picked on . 
helps to avoid the virus scanner when i am charging  no one wants a slower computer at work !   . 
i just left the stone inside the oven to cool . 
i was unable to find the farberware corresponding cover ,  but really like this one . 
first set lasted num_num years ,  is still sharp and for the most part is intact . 
i like my coffee real hot and this one does the job . 
just be sure to read up on how to kill botulism before it kills you . 
i know they re strong and the glass finish is really great ,  but they are so light that they feel . 
it gives you a nearly plug and play hdmi terminal . 
this is a great alternative when my charging port was broken on my evo num_extend
the coffee container can hold up to num_num tablespoons of coffee . c . 
after i was given it ,  though ,  i put it aside and didn t even open it until tonight . 
while we ve only had the unit for a couple weeks i am very pleased . 
cutting a pineapple on its  first use ,  it was yellow and needed laundering immediately .  .  . and stayed stained . 
i use num_num single hooks about num_num inches apart if i am hanging utensils . 
once the dough is started ,  this works well . 
the spatula may be a bit too long . 
yet after i used it i m pretty well satisfied with my purchase . 
having recently moved to an apartment with carpet ,  we needed a vacuum again . 
the clear top got coffee beans dumped on it more that once; opaque might be better . 
the copper disk at the bottom does not cover the entire bottom . 
we bought one set and loved them so much we orderd another set . 
that style is a bit more portable ,  but not by much . 
it s a simple product for a simple purpose and it does it s job wonderfully . 
the addition of a thermostat is usually not found in other brands similar to this fan . 
this is a fantastic pan if you like it crispy and crunchy !  . 
got this tip from a bartender at a wine bar . 
if it had been engineered by someone familiar with the draining process ,  the handle would not curve up . 
a cup of corn and this this is a hit . 
but after i make coffee ,  i don t want to go back and make it again . 
the price is great and is well worth the cost !  . 
otherwise ,  great case ,  shipped fast ,  would order from this seller again and again . 
the picture doesn t show that each bowl has a lid . 
i m so glad to be back in the  brewed  coffee  business  and away from that luke warm ,  dripped stuff . 
i manage my company s blog program and often shoot video interviews along with photos . 
get the coarser one for softer cheeses and onion . 
sometimes we get one we are really happy with ,  sometimes we settle and live with it . 
tighten the two clamp screws if need be . 
this really has not been a problem ,  and can ,  in fact ,  help keep food from sliding off the edge . 
it is a good buy just the same . 
it still looks good but not as it was when i first purchase . 
the battery i got with my batteries did not work so i had to order this one . 
i use it on my center burner and once it heats up ,  it works great . 
not sure what others were writing about when they said that the case began to peel . 
they don t break and they aren t near as heavy as the larger pyrex bowls . 
just wait for the yellow temperature light to go out again before trying to make steam . 
this fan is good for my small space . 
this popcorn maker was clearly made for the serious popcorn lover . 
but for $ delivered ,  you get your money s worth either way . 
just make sure to take the handle off before you leave it in the oven !  !  . 
i m so impressed that i ordered an extra for my son s dorm room . 
so far ,  it does exactly what it s supposed to . 
and perfectly fine for cooling cookies and other light weight things . 
it wouldn t have to be tight and yet could keep the electronics secure . 
i had never purchased a refurbished item before but this is fabulous . 
another reviewer mentioned using room temperature eggs , to help avoid sticking and this really works . 
i used screws of my own that i knew would have some anchoring in the wall to hold . 
i would like to order more in different colors . 
i had one ,  ordered another plus replacement bristles . 
in num_num hours i had a great tasting ,  creamy and home made yogurt . 
i wanted these to use to slip over my iron skillets to take them from the oven . 
my only complaint is that it seems to leave a lot of the garlic clove behind . 
its great !  other chain stores have something similar for so much more money . 
on the whole a great usb cable for my iphone . 
i bought several because they were so inexpensive . 
the design is different ,  but you can tell the same company made both . 
as long as you buy a high end steel ,  you really won t go wrong . 
heavy enough ,  price was reasonable and it is easy to clean . 
tiny microwaves probably will not work with this . 
there is nothing in my view more beautiful than perfect ,  contemporary ,  cobalt blue fiesta dinnerware !  . 
turn it down ,  jabra .  .  . we aren t impressed . overall ,  i really like the product . 
simply put ,  this thing makes a great cup of coffee . 
like most oxo products that i have used it seems to be fairly well made . 
i have only had to charge them once and have gotten a lot of use out of them . 
its not supposed to keep the entire meal at the same temperature . 
since i can t charge it ,  ended up returning the battery . my order was through alpha inc . 
after canning several batches of jam with the magnetic stick ,  i found myself jealous of my grandma s lid rack . 
i ve dropped my phone so many times and this case has yet to break on me . 
i bought this as a replacement and i find it is well made and works as advertised . 
i contacted the seller and he timely replied and processed another screen protector right away for free . 
provides adequate protection without adding much bulk to the phone . 
after searching different websites for cake domes ,  i found this classic . 
it works well ,  the insulation sleeve does indeed keep things nice and cool  we haven t tried hot  . 
i envy the newer model luxury cars that include bluetooth through the stereo of the car with hidden microphones . 
no one can ever tell i m on a headset . 
this screen protector does the job verry well i am glad i purchased this . 
and amazon can eat the one word needed bs . 
i had purchased a lower end vacuum sealing kit from another manufacturer about num_num years ago . 
kept the level num_num inch below the spout as instructed . 
we made cookies and timed them with it and the clock was right on time afterwards . 
fits num_extend num_extend num_extend num_extend and num_extend at last i know which covers go with which skillets . 
then one of my cookbooks recommended a really expensive rosle garlic press $
absolutely love this product ,  it works ad is easyto wear . 
i like that it doesn t have a filter  which is why i had to get a new humidifier  . 
my granddaughter ,  unfortunately checks my mail ,  so she knows when they come in . 
its not really a big problem and they work fine on the iphone num_extend
they seem to do well in the dishwasher . 
it s not horrible ,  but it s there in my setup . 
two usb ports  with different amperage levels if that matters to you  . cons : no charging cable included ,  which is odd . 
looks great and it was easy to assemble . 
my wife has had a kitchenaid mixer for many years . 
an iphone num_num is not exactly the same as an iphone num_extend there are differences . 
there are very few seller that cares about customer voice and provide solutions . 
also ,  they seem to stand up to the action of my dishwasher very well . 
i have broken so many garlic presses that i finally found one that i can use without any problem . 
purchased this unit to use in the kitchen . 
the notch in the spout part works well in letting air out as you fill . 
i like this dish set so much i ordered two so i could have an num_num person service . 
at least on my application it did not num_extend hyundai sonata  . 
if you re like me ,  your battery runs out at the most inopportune times . 
got a lot of these and am not sorry i bought them . 
i ve been using this model for almost three years and am very satisfied with it . 
if you ever decorated cakes with fondant this is the tool you need to help get a smooth edge . 
i had wanted a george foreman grill and found this one . 
the legs are made by bending the ends in a loop around the rack . 
i must say ,  i really loved this phone . 
the instructions manual from omega leaves a lot to be desired . 
both those problems are now gone with this new trackpad . 
comfortable in the ear and clear sound as well as noise cancelling technology have made this a great choice . 
i have owned this unit for around num_num months and it has worked flawlessly . 
even though my evo looks thicker it s worth it cause of the protection it offers . 
easy to assemble ,  work great on carpet and tile floors . 
i hear it s because num_extend doesn t yet use num_extend as a standard which most browsers now fully support . 
i just got my jambox and had zero problems getting it paired with my iphone num_extend
this was a gift and it was greatly appreciated . 
they was in the dishwasher and come out looking like they did before they were used . 
when attached to the hood ,  it does not rock back and forth when pushing the buttons . 
i got a replacement shipped to me and it works well . 
i travel a lot and always need a way to charge my phone . 
we were at our favorite french restaurant in dallas and had asked how they cooked a dish . 
more importantly ,  they handle very nicely ,  ingredients like flour ,  sugar ,  etc . 
they hold up well to sharp knives ,  clean easily ,  and can be curled to pour cuttings into a dish . 
made with a strong plastic and a thick silicone . 
the battery fit perfectly and was able to charge the second battery perfectly . 
i would give this num_num stars if i could !  !  . 
amazon ,  if you want to stay competitive ,  price your items lower !  . 
we had purchaced this on a whim one evening preparing to make cole slaw . 
if it only was num_extend i d buy more . 
this might also be user error !  overall ,  a good sturdy teapot for the money . 
i don t get why this gets so many one stars . 
as this battery has a standard usb port it can charge anything that uses a usb charge . 
i can also but a couple of flash drives in with my bluetooth . 
can t wait to put my own chicken on it . 
we love our cast iron stuff from lodge . 
this very simple device goes a long way to fixing that problem . 
it s very sharp ,  so watch your fingers ,  but great product !  . 
i always ask the individual how i sound ,  because they always sound great to me . 
i am concerned about losing the cap and then the clip for the pocket is gone too . 
two pork chops is all you are going to fit on it . 
the browser is so much faster under num_extend utilization is vastly improved as well . 
this tablet uses num_extend and an unusual  nokia style  charging tip . 
many stitches later ,  and still pretty numb ,  these have cut through a second digit . 
these were purchased to hold larger items on the fridge . 
i looks nice in the drawer and holds the silverware like it is suppose to . 
i make at least one smoothie a day ,  and the gears show no signs of wear . 
the french press is beautiful and looks elegant sitting on my counter . 
for the price you can t get any better . 
despite some negative reviews about it not being insulated ,  i really dont understand what they are talking about . 
i would equate it to  white noise  in offices . 
as i had admitted in an earlier review :  i do not like wmf s avocado slicer . wmf profi plus avocado slicer . 
they are very easy to apply but it does take a little effort to get the air bubbles out . 
it is easy to use and the filter lasts a pretty long time considering we are big water drinkers . 
when i got them probably with in a week time ,  i found ten devices to use these . 
buy one for each car and a few as gifts . 
i used to put my veggies in aluminum rather than boil ,  but that had a tendency todry them out . 
i m sure there are many other containers that would work . i hope this review helps . 
so i think having one of each would be perfect . 
the headlight is an useful feature for corners ,  closets and under the table . 
i just take out what i need and reseal the cannister . 
buy it ,  do not hesitate because you will love this cake pan too !  !  !  . 
they look very nice sitting on the kitchen table . 
and the lid from the pan fit the steamer . 
the screen guard does what it is supposed to do ,  keeps the screen from getting jacked . 
my mom visited and she fell in love with it . 
my only complaint is i don t see the smallest num_num or num_num sizes being useful . 
i also looked at the westbend and hamilton beach percolators . 
i was hoping i would not have to take off my phone s minimalist gel cover . 
i tested them with both my iphone num_num and my ipad num_extend
however ,  that does not mean that the num_extend is a  dead  product . 
now onto my num_extend  phone with this gizmo and i still like it . 
one reviewer wrote that after a week the prefilter was still clean . 
this is a rare product that actually gets better over the years . 
the iphone is a good phone ,  but missing the features i mentioned . 
once i got back ,  it was rma d without trouble . 
it is quiet and grinds a tablespoon of flax seed in seconds . 
this product does the work running on low speed . 
in fact i occasionally forget i m wearing it . 
the capacity of this num_num mah battery pack is outstanding . 
i like to have a cup when i first wake up ,  before i bother with anything else . 
that it would help keep the oven hot when you opened the door . 
being so thin it s amazing how well it handles . 
i purchased this yogurt machine a few days ago . 
it still works but may drain your ipad s or galaxy tab s battery faster . 
it works fine but is quite large and  clunky  . 
replaced a much more expensive ,  but older kohler sink drainer with this one . 
this was the first case i ordered for my phone . 
boy ,  are you in for a tasty treat . 
i have several delonghi products and am very happy with them . 
the push unit needs to be slightly engaged in order for the blade to start . 
i always expect quality stuff from oxo ,  and they didn t let me down on this brush . 
i hate to clean up after i impulsively do my  cooking  ,  so i only have two other gadgets . 
i dunno ,  maybe they needed to fiddle with the color a bit to take away the child s toy quality . 
i use these on the grill for some items which my very large grilling tongs can t really grab . 
the only thing about that ,  its not consistent . 
so many were hard to set ,  didn t respond as well to buttons ,  or just didn t seem as responsive . 
it s not big deal ,  it works good and worth the money . 
the safety features are great ,  like the short magnetically attached cord . 
it s always the one i reach for first . 
if i have a very wear signal of one bar ,  i might end up with two . 
the pockets are very deep ,  which make it hard to see the shoe and makes for a tight fit . 
i chopped ,  sliced ,  shredded and ground with ease . 
i m replacing my leaky mr coffee ice tea maker . 
this charger mas saved me in a couple of blackouts . 
this is a low temp storage bin that has a connection to the freezer via a vent . 
don t know were some of the reviewers got their  watery  taste and no  head  opinions . 
you can scan ebay until your eyeballs fall out and you won t find a better deal than this . 
easy to install both on the front and back . 
i have many oxo utensils ,  and so far i have very few complaints . 
i found it after i already installed the skin when i took the box completely apart . 
thermostat and electrically reversible too ,  as well as each fan can be operated independatly . 
this was really a problem with my treo num_num and a little less with my iphone num_extend
double walled aluminum insulation ensures the coffee stays hot . 
we ve made a few batches of ground beef and num_extend
however ,  i struggled determining what size to get . 
no cheap substitutes here . a big thing i like about this model :  the dripless pouring spout . 
when amazon has them in stock ,  i buy . 
for me ,  i have listened to music ,  but just in one ear ,  its not as satisfying . 
i only use this for grinding coffee beans ,  which it does well . 
i love this cast iron so much i m thinking of investing in another . 
might look better on the black iphone but still very nice on the white . 
i purchased december num_num this pan to specifically make a cross cheesecake with line of strawberry inside for christmas . 
what the hey ?  took me five minutes and a magnifying glass to find which was left or right . 
i was surprised at how small it was but that hasnt been a problem . 
if i could make any changes ,  i d make the  cleaner  section protrude a bit more than it current does . 
ive tried the softer ,  harder ,  normal ,  and quick cook settings . 
this phone does everything well ,  and nothing great . 
it s super gummy and very easy to get stuck onto itself . 
i ve used mine to make margaritas and it was wonderful . 
i ll definitely be getting some good use out of this popper . 
the manufacturer should have done this but not a big deal . 
only proble i ve had is a loose battery contact in my old one . 
my doll collection can now be tiered so that i can see them all . 
other than that ,  it sure is a nice ,  warm heater !  . 
the handle is a nice wood and has a great weight to it . 
since this was one of today s deal ,  i decided to buy and i am glad i bought it . 
it irritating but i can work with it . overall construction is solid and seems to be pretty good quality . 
the numbers are very easy to read and the timer bell gets your attention . 
and ,  i was impressed with how easy the clean up was . 
the protector makes the phone look shiny and brand new but the cover itself isn t slippery . 
we bought the dehydrator three years ago and it has exceeded our expectations . 
i have considered this scoop for sometime but not sure what size to get . 
the lock and unlock button is subtly placed on the top right ,  which is very convenient . 
this is so cute  ,  fun ,  quirky and well made . 
 i m not talking about jean or twill leggings . 
coffee improved by a long shot with the filtered water . 
i m enjoying the relection screen and also recieved a cleaning cloth with it . 
i bought this breville two weeks ago and am amazed at its quality . 
i bought this mattress for the grandchildren to sleep on when they visit . 
num_num stars because the blades are not quite as stiff as i would like ,  but it works very nicely . 
you can read the measurments at any angle . 
this little microplane gets just the colored part of the rind ,  all of it ,  with very minimal effort . 
i like that the small tray slides back and forth on the larger one . 
it s a great skillet ,  i use it almost daily now . 
it s been my experience with bluetooth listening devices that a year is all you can expect ,  at best . 
this apple corer and slicer is great !  i love it and so does my child . 
i regretted it and wanted to trade her ,  but she refused . 
the metal for the cups is of medium thickness . 
however ,  it gets the job done and it s well made . 
eventually the nonstick coating was no longer nonstick ,  even with brushing oil between every waffle . 
leaves no residue or marks on my kindle fire ,  iphone or lenovo laptop . 
i ve been very happy with this tool and would happily recommend it . 
first ,  it is a great deal !  i had a more expensive motorola and it didn t have the sound clarity . 
this unit  like the old one  has a num_num to num_num cup brewing option . 
the case is ok ,  it fits snug on the phone and protects it pretty well . 
these are well made and sturdy with a great grip . 
because of its size ,  it can fit in any drawer . 
again i try to make care calls curt or call back from a static location . 
great purchase and you won t be disappointed in it !  . 
i like that it is light weight because a ceramic bowl of similar size would be quite heavy . 
other than that i really like the color of the case it looks great on my phone . 
not for its mediocre blade ,  but for its handle . 
i bought this to have a small portable usb charger . 
it cooks evenly and is so heavy that you know it is worth the price after one use . 
it does just what it is supposed to and i love it . 
some reviewers said they had problems with charging high draw devices . 
this coffeepot does a wonderful job of making a flavorful ,  smooth cup . 
i got this item for a crazy good price and it s paid for itself in just upholstery cleaning alone . 
you just can t go wrong with genuine cast iron products . 
it s hefty and the colors are pretty much true to those in the product description . 
i bought this for my son since he is on the road a lot . 
this little skillet is fantastic ,  as you would expect from lodge . 
it was delivered on time and in great condition . 
it s a great warming tray for your pizza . if you haven t tried this out it works great . 
i use them for deadheading my roses ,  hydrangeas ,  etc . 
i guess there s an issue with where the cord bends when something is charging . 
i ve been very surprised with how well it works . 
i do have to take off one full star for sound quality . 
now if we could just get them to pick up the shells . 
the bright colors however will fade when you bake the cupcakes . 
the size of the dashboard mount is a good size and fits in my glove compartment . 
works great at a fraction of what they charge you in your cellphone store . 
not sure how they are able to sell something that would damage what it is made for . 
the knife is very sharp and works perfectly on bread . 
my grandkids  expect  waffles when they spend the weekend with me so i cook them often . 
i love being able to zip the curtain open and closed with no hangups !  . 
it s a great product for a decent price . 
its perfect and i love to see it sitting pretty on our table . 
have used it many times and can t believe how powerful it is . 
we were in need of a new pan to replace the one we had for our toaster oven . 
the case that comes with the clip is flimsy and trash ,  hence ,  the missing star . 
very cheap ,  and i don t mean quality and fast shipping . 
a dense cake ,  like a pound cake is the goal . 
i m slowly replacing all the knives in my kitchen . 
you don t have to worry about it not sticking and falling in your lap or on the floor . 
it cleans up easy ,  it s sturdy and a simple rinse is all that is needed . 
in the store are num_num or num_num dollars activated . 
the idea behind the flexible stand is fantastic . 
i use this almost on a daily basis . 
ordered this for my daughters iphone num_num and it fit perfectly on it . 
so ,  a $ mazzer robur espresso grinder this is not . 
sound quality is amazing from these speakers despite the diminutive size . 
it pealed off without leaving any residue !  hooray !  pyrex is my favorite brand . 
this could of course happen the first time . 
no one likes to iron ,  but this one makes it a little easier . 
henry ford said you could buy the model t in any color as long as it is black . 
i read the other reviews and made my choice based on their comments . 
it works great and delivers clean tasting water . 
they really got a kick out of it . 
there are more expensive models ,  but this one really works fine for most people . 
this is so the hanger does not blow away during outside drying . 
i have been using the case for about a week now . 
i purchased this battery and i ve put it through my own personal mobile phone battery torture test . 
i used those expensive competitors ,  but henckels beats them all . 
good fit and seems rugged enough for him . 
you can detach the measuring cups from the ring when you need to use them . no  cons  at this time . 
i use both my ipad num_num and iphone num_num to stay connected while i am camping . 
after some time of me not hearing the cooker i got curios and opened it again . 
i don t like grounds in my coffee and ,  with melita disc filters ,  i get none . 
adequate oxygen must also be supplied to facilitate burning as well as to sustain life . 
i just recently bought the blue buds x and there is a great change from freedom . 
you ll never have to fry anything in batches again . 
it s so easy to do ,  and you truly do get perfect results ,  each time . 
i also didn t have to partially freeze the meat either because i ve got a good quality sharp chef s knife . 
we purchased this large rectangular baking dish and it is superb in form and function . 
i am very happy with the sound quality . 
far superior to the old press it grinder i had before . 
perfect gift for those who enjoy canning or for those just starting a household . 
i knocked a star off for that reason . 
no spatula except an all steel one should be left in the oven or in a hot pan . 
when the coffee is ready the light comes on . 
i  ,  pretty much ,  only drink water unless i m partaking in alcoholic libations . 
none of the supplied gels worked for me ,  i found the unit constantly falling out of my ear . 
you can slide the knife right under cookies to lift the cookies off without crumbles . 
i also read one review saying the clip allows the holster to fall off . 
but i d wait a few months for more apps and upgrades . 
i don t think you can really compare the omega masticating  auger  juicer with the breville centrifugal juicer . 
the hot water helps them to instantly dry and a paper towel is all that is needed . 
the glass is a bit thicker than for a really nice glass . 
i really like how low profile the holder is . 
it s small ,  but feels solid in your hand . 
when the case arrived i was pleasantly surprised by its solid structure . 
we love this design and highly recommend it !  !  . 
i ve used this type of scissors for years ,  and i love them . 
i have to say i love my new hoover steam vac . 
this is indeed the mother of all spice racks ,  and an essential organizational tool for serious cooks . 
this case is a conversation piece and all my friends love it . 
in the short run ,  yes ,  but in the landfills ,  not at all . 
but for someone like me ,  these work very well . 
build quality is superb and the weight really feels good and solid in your hand . 
catching the empty holster on a chair arm . 
fits the home recharger wall mount ,  the car radio recharger and also my iphone . 
it grinds the coffee beans very quickly and fine . 
it fits easily in the sink for washing greens . 
now i can listen to all the podcasts from my computer ,  ipad and cell phone . 
i sweat a lot and hate using headphones . 
but that s because i didn t read the dimensions . 
my family doesn t like things overly cheesy so the limitation on the cheese level is not a problem . 
i have it hanging from my wall socket and it just reaches the floor . 
don t waste your money on the cheaper ones . 
i found that the sound quality and volume to be very satisfactory ,  making conversation while driving a pleasure . 
bought it for my son s sprint samsung epic . 
i did it after dinner and turned a couple of fans on . 
i like the keys and have no trouble using them . 
the num_extend in particular has been my favorite . 
the tin has a bit of rust on the top of the lid . 
keeps me from sneezing too when i vacuum . 
great little phone ,  i would definitely buy this again !  . 
this case fits the bill perfectly for me . 
i use it in my car on a daily basis and i had no issues with it . 
this one works with my recipe not the one in the book but makes it beautifully . 
i m pleasantly surprised at the thick ,  firm ,  yet light ,  foam this product produces from homemade soy milk . 
but i ve left it on the charge over night and it does a great job . 
this juicer was chosen as  best  by america s test kitchen . 
i bought this on the recommendation of a consumer reports article ,  and i haven t been disappointed . 
worked great first time and every time since . 
because of this ,  the shells moved a little bit and also started to puff up when cooking . 
it has something to do with polluted outdoor air . 
the other side is great for sauteed veggies ,  bacon or making chicken nuggets . 
i have this knife as part of a set of wustof classic knives and they are fantastic . 
it also comes with a rack so it can be used as a roaster as well . 
big and sturdy enough for the light work it will be used for . 
the price was very reasonable and it looked attractive . 
i make a big batch of mini muffins on the weekends for my children s lunches ,  and they love them . 
everything i cook on it gets tough and hard on the outside . 
had a lot of problems with ones i bought at walmart ,  etc . 
my etymotics broke in less than a year  and were damned uncomfortable to boot  . fp . 
however ,  in my quest for the best coffee maker ,  i found this cuisinart central brew coffee maker . 
i have num_num dogs ,  and num_num cats in my house . 
the pod isn t actually like a storage case . 
this pressure cooker is larger and can accommodate several large ears of corn . 
the num_extend also can sync your phonebook entries so that it can announce who is calling . 
i absolutely enjoy cutting my vegestables with this knive . 
this replaces my husband s favorite old aluminum scoop that had darkened with age and become rough surfaced . 
two cup size settings ,  approx num_num and num_num ounce . 
love this product; wish it kept the coffee hot longer . 
this is a very handsome machine and works out standing . 
great phone ,  if nextel services your area ,  you won t be disappointed . 
the blade is sharp and i have not had any issues or struggles with this knife . 
the filter is much improved and easy to clean . the suction is very powerful for a vac this size . 
someone said there was no zoom on the camera ,  but there is . 
i was amazed it worked and it works without a hitch . 
i got it for my cell and it s been working fine for years now . 
i ve my roast peruvian chicken with this on in my oven several times . 
after i thought for a few seconds ,  i came to this conclusion . 
this is my first conical burr grinder ,  so i can t compare it to anything else . 
that was a great addition to the ice pick . 
they recharge pretty quickly with a standard mini  not micro  usb plug . 
you can t beat the value for the price . 
i use them for everything .  .  . marinating meat  obviously  ,  storing cookies ,  cupcakes ,  etc . 
the positive about that is that it will also protect your iphone more . 
the drip tray isn t as well made but it adequately performs its function . 
they are though ,  almost twice as expensive as this kinivo set . 
also the screen doesn t scratch ,  but it does hold a little memory of scratches . 
do not buy the cheap adapters ,  trust me ,  i already did and ended up buying this . 
but i feel it should fit a little more tightly . 
the rust formed on the spots where the slicing blade is welded to the disc . 
making the fondue in this pot is a pleasure . 
they are simple carbon based filters and they last a pretty long time . 
he said its great not having tobuy the paper filters . 
otherwise ,  i love it !  everyone who comes to stay with us wants to buy one . 
the improved model   perfect ultra   is better and more durable but not available in the us . 
i ve been using it everyday since ,  but just now writing a review . 
it is longer than cranks on other pepper grinders ,  if they even have them . 
it holds it securely in my front shirt pocket and keeps it from jumping out . 
if it ever becomes a real bother i ll just carefully cut it off with a razor knife . 
this is perfect for all sorts of small uses . 
this case is very well made and fits the iphone num_extend perfectly . 
i have used them for icing ,  lifting and scoring without a problem . 
currently one of the only headsets known to work well with the htc mogul . 
i bought this for overnight charging for ipods and cell phones . 
around my house ,  we like easy ! we also like quality and effectiveness which this sharpener delivers . 
each case i have purchased has lasted roughly one year . 
i spent a week in a rental with a kitchen and bought this for my coffee needs . 
my husband and i have been unable to fully set the power head on the body . 
i now use this for all important cakes . 
you can easily get regular volume or mute ,  but it s hard to get something in between . 
to me this outweighs any pro s or con s regarding the quality of the crema . 
my son and his girlfriend love these attachments . 
other than that i really like this product . 
lodge is superior manufacturer of quality cast iron cookware . 
quality is good and description is as stated . 
everyone enjoyed taking a turn with the whisk . 
i have a canner from num_num that had no pressure gauge on it . 
i make microwave popcorn in the big one ,  and use the smaller ones for mixing ,  serving ,  and storing . 
fewest  bluetooth clicking noises  of any bluetooth device i ve used . 
i gave this to my daughter for use in the car and so far working as expected . 
no water ,  no significant maintenance ,  no mess no num_extend
i have used this vegetable brush for just over a year ,  and it still looks brand new . 
that might be good or bad depending upon your needs . 
it has handled everything so far that i used it for . 
there are many reasons i rated this num_num star . 
we still have a wood block full of knives more . 
these are really decent quality and you cannot beat the price . 
if you like to bake ,  these work well . 
this will provide basic protection from bumps and dings . 
works good but kinda hard to read in low light without a flashlight . 
i made two scratch cakes and they both stuck to the pan . 
this is the best hand can opener money can buy . 
such a shame since it really did look good on the phone . 
no fear of there being fragile dishes ,  fiesta ware has been my choice for a long time . 
yeah i think this is a good quality jar glass . 
they are the best . put this on your phone . 
not like the clip on type that may slip out . 
first floral case i ever got and still one of the best !  love how it looks on the phone . 
they are also easy to clean . all in all ,  a good set of measuring spoons at a very affordable price . 
this works perfectly every time on every can you throw at it . 
looking for the right on so i do ruin it before i even use it . 
i purchased this to use at work for my samsung galaxy nexus . 
by the way ,  there is no super steel that isn t known to all knife makers . 
every now and then the item will need to be reattached . 
there are kbob rods and a steamer basket that you can order seperately . 
i shopped around and found this cookware set to be the best bargain for my money . 
would definitely recommend this to anyone that needs this type of filter . 
never add batter to a cold waffle iron . 
i recommend getting a whole bunch of these protecters and just replace when needed . 
even some of these had plastic ,  or strange welded seams . 
i did not over fill it ,  rather it started spewing when it got to the  refill  line . 
i ve got this same screen protector on my motorola zoom tablet and it is bombproof . 
i don t want to rehash all of the stuff that s already been said about this phone . 
this is not an important issue ,  just that you need to be aware of it . 
for smokin  hot ,  get out your cast iron or aluminum skillets . 
i was concerned about plastic particles getting into the juice . 
they all love it too and use it weekly . 
however ,  the power of the grinder is impressive . 
my kitchenaid artisan mixer is empire red and this is a perfect match . 
i would recommend this product and i will buy again !  . 
i would buy from oem again just for the customer support . 
from the start you can tell that this scoop is very solid . 
i ve bought nearly a half dozen of these over time . 
invest in these ,  and you ll only have to buy once . 
it is so easy to use and makes it easy to get the cake out . 
i would buy this again and recommend it to others . 
i have a hydrosil heater in one bedroom ,  and it s pretty good ,  but the cost was over $
i have quite a few pans inherited from family members and even some garage sale finds . 
so ,  when i discovered the braun kettle ,  i went for it . 
based on the other reviews i was expecting quite a monster . 
it s easy to use and easy to clean . 
the manual that comes with the zojirushi is leaves a little to be desired . highly recommended . 
i can t believe i lived without an electric skillet for so long . 
awesome product !  my previous rice cooker finally bit the dust so i had to replace it . 
i think i m going to order a couple more . 
these corning ware bowls continue to look brand new even after years of use . 
this brush helps me make short work of the cleaning part . 
used cautiously though ,  the unit functions very well for my purpose . 
i love the dual case that came for the phone . 
last night i let my daughter play on my phone upstairs while i played with these downstairs . 
i am slowly replacing most kitchen plasticware ,  and these are perfect . 
this case cover is very thin and i imagine would only protect from scratches and the smallest of bumps . 
these measuring cups have sturdy handles with nice clear quantity markings on the handle . 
it does the job and does it well . 
i love the clever people who design things to make your life easier !  . 
pretty good batteries ,  and charger works although the num_num prongs aren t the best . 
the sound quality is ridiculously good !  i don t know how these speakers work so well ,  but they do . 
i haven t had any problems with the case interfering with the screen protector . 
it has a lip that protects the front . 
i owned one before but had to get rid of it when we moved . 
now ,  i wouldn t dream of parting with this trash can !  it is the easiest to use . 
as a chef ,  i get to be pretty picky about what i cook with . 
the ones with the dial are easier to see that you didn t turn it off . 
i would rate it five stars were it not heavy . 
this set reflects items nearby ,  wonderfully well ,  and of course ,  we love using this creamer and sugar bowl !  . 
i owned this for my large dining room table and bought this one for my kitchen table . 
but again ,  you need space to keep it . 
it has almost eliminated the use of my microwave which is a good thing . 
the impressions coffeemaker if perfect for anyone who wants to set up their coffee pot in the evening . 
i have only used it once ,  but it did a great job . 
the darned grommets at the base keep popping off . 
easy to apply ,  and the air just comes out from under it on your own . 
it is a good deal because it is not easy to find something like this for this price . 
the other one was mint . i m very pleased with this purchase ,  and i m sure you will be as well . 
cancelling the account with sprint was super easy . 
using the special attachment ,  egg whites and whipping cream beat up really quickly and reliably ,  too . 
if you do not center protector on screen properly ,  it will not adhere completely . 
my favorite ?  fresh grapefruit juice with sugar ,  fresh mint ,  and lime juice . 
i like the look and feel of these headphones . 
and i just use the shell when i am not working . 
the size of them is great ,  the sound is good ,  and i really like using them . 
i found the more i used it the more discolored it became . 
though somewhat limited when compared to single sim phones that border on smart phone capabilities . 
if you need this kind of holder ,  i d recommend you give this one a serious look . 
i bought two !  it was easy to assemble ,  and the second one went together much faster than the first . 
this size is great for storing almost anything . 
i should mention though that i had this attached to the diffused shower glass which isn t perfectly smooth . 
it has a lot of power and i can easily move from one floor surface to another . 
but hey ,  that s why i own two of these cases now haha . 
the french plunger filters are fairly ubiquitous and easily found @ num_extend hand stores where i live . 
just don t go around shopping online without your parents permission . 
the non stick pans work well ,  and have not had any problems with them . 
when it came i set up a work station and washed everything and got lint free cloths ,  etc . 
made with good materail . does it s job well ! good size ,  too . 
num_extend for the num_extend but still definitely not any better than the old pda . 
it does a nice job and for the price is a well built unit . 
this is truly like driving a mercedes as opposed to a volkswagen . 
who couldn t say  yes  to such a looker ?  !  !  ?  !  . 
i got tired of always tripping over the cord of my old headphones . the sound quality is very good . 
remember not to put them in the dishwasher . 
great deal ,  priced right ,  works great .  .  . actually better than the original . 
for that reason ,  it works a little slower than a pan made for induction but not drastically slower . 
and if this thing feels heavy on your ear ,  you must have ears the size of nickels . 
the battery is a good quality and the phone charges well with it . 
i ve bought several of these over the years . 
i use to monitor the smoker and the other to monitor the meat . 
this phone holder is perfect for hands free and bluetooth usage . 
i didn t the first time and the waffle had to be pried out in pieces . 
i can get around the entire bowl in one stroke . 
i was expecting a heavier product  this weighs num_extend or there abouts  but it does the job very well . 
why bother with color when i plan to keep it covered anyway . my recommendations are : if you cook ,  buy good equipment . 
there were points where i could not hang up the phone because of this problem . 
on a few occasions it was finicky about connecting to the phone but generally works fine . 
so much healthier to add your own oil . 
this is the best grinder i ve seen in a long time . 
this works with various batteries and takes two different cable connectors . 
the grinding is loud and long ,  although i would expect that of any burr grinder . 
i much prefer the kind that you push . 
i think i got it in num_num days which was a plus . 
i recommend this and i also recommend investing in a few good knives over lower range knife sets . 
fun to use ,  big enough for cooking anything big or small . 
i have owned several bundt pans ,  including a silicone version . 
went to a stainless steel model and will be purchasing another one of these soon . 
let me start by saying that i run a manufacturing company . 
the whole thing is easy to wipe down . 
there is enough for next year as well . 
i replaced my old beat up aluminum stockpot that i only used to cook crabs in with this pot . 
nice bluetooth set that really holds a charge . 
i clean cup and cap and a bit inside and that has been it . 
i ve accidently dropped the phone a few times ,  and the case has held up very well . 
great  cuz i can leave the cupcakes at home and take the cake elsewhere . 
i needed a scoop while staying at my parents  house and decided to give this one a try . 
i bought both the two and the four quart bowls . 
i tried both my slicing knife and an electric knife . 
not jut with the dehydrator but with other l equip appliances  i own their variable speed blender and love it  . 
i have used the machine at least num_num times . 
the steel platform with the two different size reamers ,  and num_extend
this little guy works well ,  though we don t use the ionizer  not sure that s really safe for the lungs  . 
when they are connected together ,  it s very cumbersome to remove one and put it back as well . 
it looks good and is not more bulky than most other cases . 
i found the product to be great for the price . 
it has been used almost every day since christmas num_extend and they have not had one problem . 
this is an excellent attachment and i should have purchased this instead of a dedicated ice cream maker . 
  .  .  .   this fast card will also improve the video performance of the hd video ability of this phone . 
they are sturdy and the white is a nice white . 
i used these for the first time yesterday to make tomato leather . 
my last pressure cooker was also a pressure caner for putting up vegetables . 
love it when you can have multiply use for one great product . 
not scalding ,  but enough that was drinkable . it is a good pot and recommend purchasing . 
i usually end up with more on the countertop than in the cup . 
every time you place the headset in the case it recharges it . 
it works great !  the only issue for me is that the volume cannot go up very high . 
great case pretty color shell however , its extremly difficult to use a car charger with this casing . 
so many to choose from ,  so i went with the first good review found here on amazon . 
it s going to be a small bowl . i m sure i will be giving these as a gift again very soon !  . 
when i first purchase my iphone ,  i ordered three covers from verizon and they were about $
he has much larger hands and also uses it easily . 
it makes beautiful cakes with very precise and clearly defined points and grooves . 
a friend can share a mug or i can save it . 
i use it by door and it blasts in cooler air in evening . 
so i read reviews and landed on these . 
i have had an older model eureka mighty mite canister vacuum for over ten years . 
the smaller tips that these earphones come with fit her ears perfectly . 
the attachments make sense and work almost uniformly very well . 
it pretty much has every thing you may need to hang your phone in different places in your car . 
we have a labrador retriever and vacuum once a week . 
the next time i lowered the temperature after the first hour to num_num and it was perfect . 
this press is very sturdy and it has enough leverage to make it fairly easy to squeeze the cloves . 
i accidentally bought the spoon version first ,  but kept it and bought this be too . 
but is not powerfull  and it s expensive for this power  . 
the adapter worked really well for a few days . 
if voice and data ,  then roughly num_num to num_num hours . 
i got num_num stratospheres for my employees and this screen protector is great . 
at first ,  i did have to season it with oil a few times . 
nothing sticks to them ,  and they clean up easily with warm water . 
for the price these are what i would expect to receive . 
i bought this case for my wife to protect her phone from our children . 
the price is extrememly reasonable for such a quality product and shipping was fast . 
but i was swayed by the good reviews and i am really glad that i bought them . 
we rinse it .  .  . and then scrub it using a toothbrush with some dish soap on it . 
the plastic parts  like the plastic carafe lid and handle  feel like good heavyweight plastic and are well molded . 
this case is definately worth it for the price . 
all in all ,  we ve all had a great time with this and almost had a lmaorotf time . 
it works very well for us ,  with wood floors and not much carpeting . 
so far this battery has worked very well . 
i have a very teeny kitchen and about num_num cubic feet of counter space . 
pancakes will brown evenly and fish sautes nicely . 
i always thought an iced tea maker wasn t needed . 
i am very pleased with the power of this motor and its performance . 
i have actually had a bottle of wine maintain quality over three days by using this gas preservative . 
just purchased this one after my num_num cup chemex cracked after num_num years of nearly daily use . 
i store it in the freezer and am very happy with my purchase . 
my phone is very protected and has a little more weight making it more comfortable to hold . 
my wife and i like crystal clear juice and we have to filter it again . 
normal wear and tear to the dog chewing on it . 
just recently purchased this case for my wife s samsung galaxy num_extend
i love the pocket with the velcro . i would recommend this cover to anyone . 
it is the perfect size for finger foods . 
the keys are a bit small ,  but that is easy to live with . 
if you are impatient and just want a fast cup ,  stick with your coffee maker or swing by starbucks . 
i work outside and i here the caller quite fine . 
i love this thing !  it is half the size of my last one . 
unlike a wooden spoon ,  this one won t split ,  crack or absorb anything . 
i and at least one of the kids eat the peel as well . 
i love this phone cover !  i bought it about num_num months ago and i still love it . 
i drink loose leaf tea and this strainer is excellent for this task . 
i have been using this spry bottle for num_num months now and so far its good . 
where it is lacking is in internet connection speed . 
overall they are clear and protective .  .  . which means a lot to me . 
you can chop foods as small as you like without having to chase it around the board . 
great little gift item . i dont think there is a better deal out there . 
but it was awesome and protected my phone like a pro  :   . 
it is plastic ,  it s bound to break if it doesn t hit flat . 
cheap little product that works very well with any kind of idevices . 
so far i ve already gotten my money s worth out of this machine . 
i don t know .  .  . this is amazon or ateco .  . but i want to say thanks by sharing because the respond really good . 
one quick rocking motion and the pizza is cut . 
i even have matching colored headphones with each case . 
everyone knows that making good bread is as much an art as it is a science . 
we have owned several of these over the year . 
the area now just has a small hard area ,  mostly undetectable . 
my old copper kettle had seen its better days so i started searching for a replacement . 
these are the best active headsets for the price . 
but if you are used to sharp knives and want to do even better ,  this is it . 
i know how long meat and veggies take when cooking traditionally ,  so i time it based on experience . 
i am not worried about the card slipping out of the holder . 
it s got a nice heavy duty plastic handle so you don t have to worry about getting burned . 
and at the price that they are ,  i don t really care . 
just a little louder on the volume and i would be so happy . 
we have made several yummy desserts with them and they work wonderfully . 
i bought one of these and it works on my ipod and iphone num_extend
just what i needed and the price was very reasonable . 
it is a product for a specific use and it works fine . 
i tried third party bluetooth headsets and they weren t quite as good . 
i have tried all kinds of headsets ,  from jabra to plantronics . 
i am happy with it and would recommend it . i used it only for pancakes on my ceramic stove top . 
it does a beautiful job and i expect to use these a great deal . 
but that means they re heavier than the usual thin metal or plastic . 
it doesn t spill and i can easily attach it on my purse if i get tired of holding it . 
these glasses don t come across as high quality ,  but on the other hand ,  they are great for the price . 
there is no apparent difference in the way they operate or how they perform . 
this one in particulair is a favorite of mine because of the cover . 
and if it is not airtight ,  then the utility is not that great for keeping foods fresh . 
this is not my first cast iron pan ,  but it is my first grill pan . 
the bottom bowl is meant for soup ,  not the top one . 
my set arrived with great packaging ,  no breakage ,  and securely shipped ,  with no problems . 
i d buy another based on its solid construction and looks . 
i have many other spatulas and they are all in the back of the drawer . 
it seems to work with my touch screens well ,  although there was a little drag to them . 
although they do not recommend it ,  i ve made yellow rice ,  paella ,  and even steel cut oatmeal in my cooker . 
charge your cell phone when you re on the road . 
they seem to clean up very well too . 
yep ,  it s huge !  make sure you have the space for it . 
from a gamecom num_num to standalone desktop table microphones along with audio technica headphones . 
if you want that then perhaps you should stay with a mr . 
i have given num_num stars because they are what they are and i did not expect anything more . 
if not ,  no wonder you are getting bubbles . 
did i mention it is made in the usa ?  thank you tennessee . 
and the hearing ,  thanks to philips ,  is so much clearer . 
but that s because i didn t know that amazon has them for sale . 
for that reason ,  i gave it a num_num rather than a num_extend
so we bought another like it because we liked how the first one worked . 
it s about the same for my itouch num_extend gen . 
the other reviews sold me on this model and i absolutely love it . 
i use it at least once a week . 
place enough shortening in each slot of the pan ,  to see the grease float . 
i was greatly surprised to find that the cake was higher and lighter than previously in the old pan . 
the lids are tight and it takes a bit of technique to put them on . 
plus ,  this is one grinder you won t want to tuck away and hide on the counter . 
when it s time to serve on the table ,  it becomes a conversation piece as well . 
i use this all the timeand am very happy with the quality . 
i had this product for num_num weeks now . 
thin and rigid enough to slide under delicate food ,  but not metal . 
this pack also holds the charge well so it can be very handy in a pinch . 
wow ,  why didn t i buy these years ago ?  they are great . 
they are very compact when folded so they travel easily . 
this case has a super look to it . 
regardless of the photo ,  the headphones did not contain the foam covers for the ear pieces . 
i am quickly becoming a fan of this brand . 
nice longhandle makes it good for grilling fish and not burning your hand . 
i got this as a gift for my sister a couple of years ago . 
received the dutch oven and have used it num_num times . 
a simple and solid black design ,  at a great price . 
the only problem i had was balancing the machine on the stairs because the hose was not long enough . 
and the only ones that really can get all the contents out of a bowl . 
i have no doubt they will last for years ,  even with the heavy use they endure !  . 
this makes a great reusuable gift bag for the star wars fan . 
makes clean ,  clear cuts with a little twist of your wrist . 
pitcher is only num_extend my old krups had a num_extend num_extend
i purchased my first iphone num_extend in february num_extend
if you leave the cooker on the shelf for months at a time ,  it might be an issue . 
the pan is heavier than it looks ,  but not too heavy . 
i ve had this electric kettle for about num_num years and it still works great and boils water quickly . 
it is working on second gen ipod ,  num_extend and num_extend
they would get nasty ,  dull ,  harder to use ,  the crank would break ,  etc . 
i buy the oxo num_extend set and it didn t come with a bottle opener . 
i grew up with my mom only using the granite ware roasting pans . 
left it there overnight and the next day ,  it just simply popped off . 
i have not yet used except to talk but it does do more things . 
my wife and i have had these phones for a little over a week now and we love them . 
i have had the wallet less that a year so i consider this a major defect in durability . 
i will use this to boil the tea water and that is its dedicated use . 
not carry them ,  neither do the regular places where you can buy vac . 
love this product ,  it s very affordable and responsive . 
works great and boils water fast and easy to clean . 
the work bowl has seen the dishwasher hundreds and hundreds of times and has held up well . 
coffee and such standard department store fare ,  it s a better option and a great buy . 
i use it frequently when cooking and it is indispensable for preparing foods for dehydrating . 
they handle so beautifully and slice through vegetables as if they were butter . 
i would recommend taking it apart and drying it out if you submerse it completely . 
anyways the plantronics works great clear sound good control ,  high volume for open window driving . 
i m sure i will find a use for it . 
i am not upset w amazon; they must set their own prices ,  just as others do . 
that s about all i m looking for in a meat thermometer ,  so for the price it can t be beat . 
as for being refurbished it came absolutely perfect . 
i don t know what this one does differently ,  but the collection bin pours the ground coffee out with ease . 
the cell phone service is the key ,  not the phone . 
it can also connect to two phones simultaneously . 
the tall glass in much skinnier than the shorter one . 
i ordered the num_extend size ,  i could have done better with a smaller one . 
it easily takes care of eggs ,  batters ,  or just about anything you can throw at it . 
they are the best truly large num_num cup food processor . 
the motor doesn t even slow down with those same three loaves of bread dough . 
not bad for the price i paid and the shipping was fast . 
if you are just starting to put your  well appointed  kitchen together ,  this pan is a must . 
i will have to season it again as there are some bare spots around the rim . 
i kept struggling and struggling to  make it open  the traditional way ,  and it had been open all along . 
this scoop makes baking cookies a much faster ,  less tedious project . 
my box looked like it had been through the war . 
i ll leave the accolades to the other num_num star reviews . 
a quick comparison with a vintage percolator from my little collection reveals that the s . s . 
toss in rice and water and hit a button . 
we just received our honeywell air purifier and i have to say it is amazing . 
we can walk all over a num_num square foot space without issues . 
i love this zester !  i received this as a gift from my mom about ten years ago . 
this bose headset takes you one step closer to that sort of a future . 
i can now  keep  opened bottles potable for longer periods .  . that s a good thing . 
the handle fits nicely into my hand ,  very comfortable . 
son uses for skype and podcasts and is very pleased with quality for the price . 
i have also found it comes in surprisingly handy for food preparation . 
i can t fit a brick oven in my vertical pan cabinet . 
i wasn t sure this was the timer i wanted but everyone s opinions were so positive . 
it also beeps right before it signals for the name you want to call . 
they look like they are several years old instead of the several months they actually are . 
you do not really need a huge coupler because the bags will support the huge tips . 
i would rather the pulp fall into the glass then the seeds . 
some ovens are adjustable at their knobs ,  but electronic ovens are not . 
i think this is because for its size it is hefty . 
the batteries outlast my oem that came with the phone . 
its a pretty good charger which can charge two phones at the same time . 
the quality and craftsmanship are great and we expect to own this piece for a long time . 
most probe thermometer packages don t even disclose that they can t survive that heat . 
i had to replace an older mr coffee model that i ve had for almost num_num years . 
this works great and is so easy to use . 
i made my first attempt at making pancakes in the rings ,  i will now only make pancakes this way . 
this contraption seemed like a curious gimmick .  .  . but instead is amazing and the popcorn tastes so good . 
i work with small pieces ,  and these were perfect for the job . 
the switch makes it so easy for me to see when it s on and when it s turned off . 
my phone tells me if i m not connected to a blackberry changer and it doesn t seem to warn me . 
i wanted a case that was cheap enough where i wouldn t feel bad buying . 
they all mesh together into a small package for storage . 
and yet they never even mentioned it to me ,  or questioned me . 
a compact carry along stone acts as a backup charger and storage case . 
this is a compliment coming for a professional chef . 
using the hoover we extracted a quart of water from the num_num x num_num area of carpeting . 
when i found the eigertec dock on amazon ,  i was a little skeptical . 
in the end ,  i sort of like the manual function ,  it is a more relaxed part of my morning . 
this is a great ,  sturdy but flexible spatula . 
i have both the jambox and the big jambox . 
the artisan bowl is tall and narrow ,  well designed ,  less splashes . 
i ll update if i have more to say . 
this is as good a prefilter you will find honeywell brand . 
i like the charge indicator ,  and obviously approve of its size and weight . 
be sure to have at least a num_num gallon container to catch all the popcorn . 
the extended length is perfect for using on the grill . 
the solution to this problem was to put a piece of thin cardboard paper at the corner . 
i bought this cover to a family member and she loves it !  . 
perfect for making salads in mason jars and keeping them fresh for a week or two . 
it s great for making cooked fruit jams ,  fruit desserts ,  bread pudding ,  rice pudding . 
they haven t broken ,  and they hold liquids inside them as advertised . 
we have bottled water here ,  and i am quite devoted to my starbuck s coffee . 
it all takes a minute or two . this is a great tool . 
i typically have a problem with headphones being too quiet . 
for years ,  i have seen television infomercials and the like rave about the george foreman grill . 
she s even tried to replace them with an inferior pair of scissors ,  thinking i wouldn t notice . 
so recently when i ran into an issue i knew if i contacted them i d get good support . 
if you use your phone a lot ,  might not be the cover for you . 
if you just want to get one whisk ,  i recommend this oxo and this size . 
this is where i find a good silpat absolutely essential . 
i use the eyewear for work and it helps reduce dry eyes and fatigue . 
i have a ricer ,  but i wanted the mashed potatoes from my childhood . 
i just put the stick out for awhile to soften a bit then smush it into the bell . 
we just got the grate insert and can t wait to try it out . 
these screen protectors get the job done and for the price can t be beat . 
i have also sliced potatoes and onions directly over a baking pan . 
i finally decided to get a rice cooker . 
perfect for someone trying to decorate cookies and cakes more professionally than i have in the past . 
i love this case and was glad that i got the hard plastic on the outside . 
it s a nice looking unit and simple to operate . 
the several negative ones gave me some pause for consideration . 
you can spend more on a knife but i doubt it will perform any better . 
it does a perfect job and is easy to clean . 
that s actually one thing that i like about the new trent arcadia stylus . 
the tools are sturdy and easy to use . 
i keep thinking we should unload the others because we always reach for the shun knives . 
at the ballpark i was using num_extend  sacramento ,  minor league baseball  . 
also good for toast ,  quesadillas ,  and even chicken . 
the eggs come off the pan without a problem and taste great . 
the most common complaint about machines with an insulated carafe is that the coffee is never hot enough . 
the colors are really quite vibrant and i like them . 
it gets dirty quicker and easier than most screens . 
it works great once you get the hang of it . 
the manufacturer did a good job of insulating the motor from the housing to reduce noise . 
this one is quite tall so consider where it will be stored . 
but it was under warranty and got replaced with another new one . so far so good . 
i have to start by saying i love anker products . 
why the manufacturer did not size them correctly or glue them in ,  i cannot understand . anyway ,  here s the num_extend
num_extend quarts doesn t sound that small ,  but the bowls are in fact tiny . 
purchased for my sister ,  will pass this survey along to her ,  but she stated she really enjoyed it !  . 
the only feature i miss is a cord retractor . 
it sounds good on both ends ,  and is very loud . 
i m seeing ground beef on sale in super market very often but not ground pork . 
the num_num watt champ cooking area is num_num square inches ,  or num_num watts per sq . 
this screen helps my cellular device to stay in pristine condition . 
i needed to purchase an num_num inch chef knife ,  a kitchen staple ,  and had been browsing around stores . 
i had a similar krups grinder in the past so i thought this one would be as nice . 
in both cases ,  it was the electronics that failed . 
it actually works !  i now enjoy a good soak in a deeper level of water . 
it has high sides and a very hefty weight to it . 
the fit again was the best we have ever tried . 
returned for the num_extend size and are happy we did . 
it pops very quickly and is easy to use . 
it s a good size ,  but not too big . 
i had bought one of these years ago and it has stood up thru the years . 
i will never go back to the zagg s after having these . 
i highly recommend these to anyone that needs a good set of tongs for cooking . 
it won t stick and is a nice addition anyway . 
looked many stores untl finally finding this online . 
it s not magnetic anyway and too heavy to be aluminum . 
i must say i am satisfied with my purchase decision . 
and every thing did great except pulpy fruit . 
they sop your phone from showing wear and tear . 
one end is usb ,  and the other is proprietary . 
with this cast iron roaster you can do it all . 
that entails figuring out how to run the long antenna cable so that it isn t in the way . 
it stores upright ,  everything is basically good . the booklet does tell u to start with simple stuff and experiment later . 
this is a big pin and it doesn t fit well into drawers . 
this rubbermaid commercial job was the only one i could find ,  and only at amazon . 
electric openers might be easier to use but when you consider space requirements this is the way to go . 
this freed up much needed cabinet space for other items !  . 
the third is a gift for a friend which i haven t yet given . 
just what you d expect ,  good quality round pans . 
good product for filling up your tub a little bit more . 
unlike electricity ,  the sun is free and out there for everyone to use and take advantage of . 
i love it and it s so soft ,  girly and protective . 
there are basically num_num parts to this thing . 
i bought this to use as a power supply for my raspberry pi . 
i think that is about as good as it gets for a review . 
yes i would buy more without question if i needed them . charles . 
i expect to use them for several presidential administrations . 
this one works really great ,  having a larger flat pounding surface ,  and it s easy to use and clean . 
the replacement wicks can be easily ordered by phoning vornado . 
anyway ,  initial charging the headset took over an hour ,  then pairing . 
so it is my guess that it was how she rolled the dough out . 
this item covers a standard dinner plate or smaller items . 
this unit heats foods very quickly without heating up the kitchen . 
for my money it was worth every cent . 
so ,  i thought i d include it in my review . 
mostly used to cut sliced fruits for my child s lunch . 
wish they were bigger so they did not have to be changed so often . 
the charger was for my mom her old one broke and they wanted num_num bucks at the verizon store . 
the lids self seal and you can store for years . 
the unit fits in the outlet perfectly ,  very slim and not a big wart sticking out of the dash . 
its perfectly smooth and clear like the iphone s screen itself . 
perfect for home brewing of beer and kombucha ,  and for use during canning season . 
i have had one of these cooking ovens for over num_num years . 
we replaced an older similar unit from another manufacturer with this one based on the amazon reviews . 
screw top to the bottom section and you are done . 
this whipped cream maker is very easy to use ,  and it looks beautiful . 
these are the first real good pans i have ever purchaced . 
i was about to get rid of my machine when i thought to try this brand . 
in any case ,  these mugs get mass approval from all my guests at parties . 
we have owned one of these before and it lasted forever ,  so we chose the same model . 
my husband used a thermometer to confirm the temperature guage and it was right on the money . 
and food just cooks better and evenly in cast iron . 
this is my second pan by lodge ,  i have a larger one . 
this grinder is great for french press ,  drip coffee makers and my favorite the aeropress . 
you can attach this to your belt and have the headset plugged in at the same time . 
not sure why people use them as i have never scratched the glass on this or my ipod touch . 
so ,  i m replacing this with a corded hand held vacuum . 
it is very quiet ,  it looks good ,  it comes with a remote control ,  the price is good . 
this is one of those products that will probably outlast you . 
it s not too tall ,  which means it fits really easily into your top num_extend
this case is similar to the iphone num_num otterbox reflix series . 
the scale is also small and pretty durable ,  making it highly portable . 
i purchased this for a friend who lives in an apartment complex with gross water . 
great for the large cakes and big batches of cookies . 
we have also used it in our rv ,  and it works well there as well . 
i got a set of corelle when i had to rebuild my kitchen . 
i have owned num_num in the last ten years and bought num_num as gifts the recipients loved them . 
the vinyl coating was coming off of my verizon droid x back ,  so i ordered this replacement . 
but i supposed engineers for samsung were worried someone might accidentally press it if anything stuck out . 
though amazon doesn t seem to sell it ,  i d also recommend the similar salt mill from the same company . 
it s not easy to remove without making a mess . 
really sturdy ,  i ve had it for about a year and it works perfectly . 
this utensil will slide under cookies stuck on a baking pan without cracking or crumbling them . 
they had it up and running in num_num minutes . 
however i losy my num_extend set of dust covers . 
received in timely manner and item was well packaged . 
the lid doesn t fall off ,  like the hamilton beach i had before this one . 
cleanup was a breeze and the small size of this unit also makes it a breeze to store . 
for the price ,  if you are considering these ,  get this one . 
i have had a dirt devil in the past and was pleased with it . 
purchased this case as a gift for a friend . 
and when they say that it cannot stand up to knife blades they mean it . 
the combination of these two purchases prompted me to write my first reviews . 
if you want a really ground up meat i d run it though the grinder twice . 
i have wanted one of these for a long time . 
i love it . also ,  the sound quality is unparalleled . 
and the hose extension is a bit awkward to use but also quite powerful . 
bought a cover and a hook for utinsels at target . 
that made it a bit awkward because the wire was taking more pressure than my previous one . 
the lid sometimes puffs up and down from the steam .  .  . but i don t know if that matters or not . 
i bought myself one so i quit borrowing hers . 
makes dinners and baking reults a dream ! large ,  yes . 
a have many different spatulas ,  but this is the one i reach for time and again . 
this case is the best one for the iphone . 
next time i need a set of hooks it will be this same style . 
i was questioning this product when i saw it demoed by several people on youtube . 
chop it up ,  remove most of it ,  then add more to chop up . 
i have little to no signal even though i can see the cell tower in the distance . 
kind of hurts my ears !  it works really well ,  though . 
i love it ,  never leave home without it !  !  it s usb to micro usb . 
in the long run ,  would have saved the price many times over . 
you can even start items on the stovetop and finish them in the oven . highly recommended . 
i bought this one because it looked very slick and small . 
sometimes the wrong unit will respond to the orders ,  most of the reviews i ve read say as much . 
when it seems clean ,  dry it thoroughly with paper towels . 
the first case was for the iphone num_extend and it held up great . 
for the first year ,  the carbon filter absorbed all odor and fruit flies never found their way in . 
if i have any issues i will edit my rating . 
i also bought the class kit to go with it and it works great . 
the little forked end makes preparing tomatoes a breeze and we go through a lot of fresh ones . 
they are balanced ,  easy to hold and work well . 
while charging ,  it s a good idea to place your num_extend in a location where it won t be moved . 
i did not use a  best practice  before . 
wish it fit longer potatoes ,  texas spuds are huge . 
product is easy to use and works as advertised . 
this blender matches all my other pink appliances and is also a quality product . 
i have used it at least once a week and as many as five times a week . 
except for the color they look exactly the same . 
this is the best peeler i have ever used . 
the num_num top containers don t hold heat in that much and end up cold after an hour or so . 
this filter just seems to last and last . 
i have used this on my imac ,  netbook ,  voip phone and cel . 
you shouldn t have any problems provided you take your time and install it properly . 
plus the handles make it easy to be lifted ,  and the slight edge keeps liquid in the pan . 
about the only other option in wireless headsets for stereo and music use . well . 
the nonstick interior and paddle are great for easy cleanup . 
the dish can be put in the oven ,  the cover can not . 
it is the best juicer i have ever used and now that i have it ,  i find it indespensible . 
i have never placed it in the dishwasher . 
the design is excellent and the pot is sturdy . 
it has replaced my car bluetooth and making voice calls is even more simple . 
the pestle is much easier to move then the mortar and does not weigh too much or to little . 
so ,  that means ,  nothing was spilling during the cooking process . 
filters well ,  replacement filters are easy to find and aren t prohibitively expensive ,  so this pitcher meets our needs . 
if you re considering ever getting a car dock ,  play it safe any buy this case . 
if you can do that ,  the coffee pot will last forever . 
very glad i chose this model with the attachments . 
not a bad setup ,  looks good ,  but even when it s clean it still tend to smell of booze . 
it is purely cosmetic however and they rubbed of with a swipe of my finger . 
unlike oxo s early kitchen tools ,  it is simply not perfect . 
all work fine and glad i can clean the outer filter with a vaccuum . 
i use it for measuring the water for my coffee . 
i think this works well as a phone protector . 
and i would defenetely prefer a clean steam to any chemicals . 
i read and watched reviews on america s test kitchen ,  they gave it really high ratings . 
couldn t be happier ! the phone should have come with this battery as far as i am concerned . 
the handles also not made for small hands . 
with the aid of an obedient microwave and water ,  you can indeed steam vegetables and seafood . 
this would be a great gift for a housewarming or wedding . 
we ve had our cocoa motion for years .  .  . and it still works . 
i ve always seen him butter the stuff though . 
i have used these saucepans for many years now . 
the reamer  blades  ,  for being made of plastic ,  are surprisingly sturdy . 
we have a stainless steel refrigerator so the memo center and pencil cup just blend right in . 
the water tastes much better than it tasted after boiling in my plastic kettle . 
it gives the icing a nice smooth finish . 
cleaning up just meant dumping water in the toilet and rinsing it out quickly . 
there are three layers to them ,  and two tabs . 
these bowls have relatively steep sides so they are easy to use for mixing small batches . 
i purchased two of these and will reorganize a bathroom cabinet with the second one . 
also ,  you need to get a really big bowl from somewhere to catch the popcorn that comes out . 
they snap on easy and stay sealed ,  which is a big plus . 
i was amazed by how little effort it takes to make great bread with this machine . 
after reading these reviews ,  i thought the product would be awful . 
i received this and the handle was completely broken off . 
this dealer seems to sell a lot and i asked for a refund . 
primary use is for pot pies and cooks evenly . 
it s not % splatter proof ,  but it s good . 
we ve been using it daily for about num_num months now with no problem at all . 
easy to put on and i have used them for other phones i have had since . 
one month later and he s still using it . 
i don t even use the popcorn button  i do it the old fashion way . 
these set of three gaskets arrive in a regular envelope . 
i have only whipped this out once for a last minute baking deal . 
i ve never installed a screen protector before ,  as i just recently purchased my iphone ,  so it was quite challenging . 
i ve seen some cheaper versions ,  but this one looks like the original . 
i ve spent the last two weeks ordering and returning bluetooth headsets . 
a pleasure to purchase an item that lives up to its hype . 
i do wish that the block would fit thezwilling j . a . 
i like it enough to send one to my dad . 
i m able to set my phone on my desk vertically or horizontally . 
was what was cool was transferring ringtones from my friend s se num_extend to mine via bluetooth . 
opening cans with the crank handle was never a favorite chore of mine . 
this could lead to me accidentally hitting buttons on the phone while i m on a call . 
no substitute for a proper cutting board by any means . 
amazon prime has this for num_num free second day shipping . 
i have used it num_num times and all of the jars sealed properly . 
but i don t care because i love it !  !  !  . 
if the mixer runs with any frequency ,  you ll never encounter it . 
it does its job decently !  the issues i have with it :  num_extend
one of the  utilities  of this size is that it makes an excellent steak knife . 
it is very well made  thick and heavy  and i plan to have it for a very long time . 
the touchpad lacks multitouch ,  but is responsive like the keyboard . 
if your looking for an easy replacement for a old pan this works . 
it has a sleek design with stainless steel . i love the automatic two hour shut off . 
sometimes ,  it leaks from the head because of too much condensation ,  so make sure to have a rug . 
let your dough rest for at least an hour . 
their long shape is perfect for scooping right into narrow openings such as spice jars . 
i needed it so badly !  i don t have to empty my bag to swap out my large tips . 
they connect to asus num_extend bluetooth dongles or my bionic . 
i also had to learn to turn down the heat so that the food doesn t burn . 
he liked it and said it was good . 
when adding the charging cord and the small instruction leaflet it s a very snug fit . 
i like the lock and the turn mechanism on the side . 
would be nice if the armband was a bit longer for those of us with larger than normal arms . 
the first time i used it i had to vacuum every room three times  no i am not exaggerating  . 
i clip it to my shirt and run the wires under my collar ,  no one notices i m wearing it . 
i rarely make one pie at a time . 
it s a bit bulky and makes the phone look twice it s size . 
i hoped that i would get them sooner but i didn t get them til a month later . 
i tried it last night and it worked . 
the chicken tastes good ,  has little fat and cooks quickly . 
the hangers are still handy and keep slacks easy to hang ,  remove quickly without much hassle and time . 
it fits well for a silicon case and gives me grip when holding my evo . 
the groove around the edge is perfect to catch juice from things like tomatoes or meat . 
finally wore out so i ordered him a new one and one for myself . 
it arrived at my home quickly ,  which i love . 
if you like popcorn alot ,  get this pan . 
i use this for pastas ,  stocks ,  and even deep frying . 
i ended up using another lint cloth from another screen protector i had laying around . 
well .  .  . i followed the directions and only noticed a couple of air bubbles . 
we have huge windows so i just put them vertically and shut the sliding window to hold them in . 
i use this almost daily and my for my navigation in my phone . 
it stays planted on the dashboard fine however . 
there s not so much you can really say about this product . 
this thing is the best appliance ,  most used little kitchen gadget i ve ever bought . 
so have a throwaway cup ready just for that . 
we cook chicken breasts and steaks in it once or twice a week . 
they all have nooks and crannies that are difficult to keep clean . but ,  boy this stuff can cook . 
you can disassemble the filter to clean it out  and i recommend you do every month or so . 
truly worth every penny and paying half of what tbest buy wanted is not bad either . 
i ve had my share of frustration with broken salad spinners . 
it deserves way more !  comes with a nice fabric case to carry it in . 
for the money ,  it is a much better value than the kitchenaid or cuisineart devices . 
i upgraded to a gas range and then upgrading the cookware was the natural next step . 
it is made very well and is excellent quality built to last . 
this save so much time and energy especially if i have time to come home at lunchtime . 
i purchased this as a gift for my father and the whole family loves it . 
i must say ,  i was pleasantly surprised with the quality and looks of this pot rack . 
it s simple ,  easy to use ,  and easy to clean . 
new trent is a solid company providing excellent products just as described  if not better  and with quick delivery . 
this will prevent any ied s from surprising you !  . 
i can only imagine people are not putting the two collection containers into place properly . 
amazon s packaging is a little better but they need to mark outside  fragile  . 
i bought a few of these for my families phones and they look great . 
my favorite scrub brush !  great for scrubbing vegetables like potatoes . 
this little timer is a nice tool ,  makes perfect eggs each time . 
i am really pleased ,  for the $ i spent on this item it s really high quality . 
it s easy to use ,  it recharges easily and quickly and the sound quality is great . 
i use it to heat the main level of my three story home on the coldest of days . 
it does a great job with small jobs like mincing garlic . 
these are perfect and cheap enough to have a few on hand . 
the back plastic scratches easily ,  but does wipe clean of fingerprints . 
they are easy to clean ,  especially if you don t have a dishwasher . 
i purchased because all of the reviews also indicated that it was so quiet . 
it is nice and heavy and very well made . 
this knife has over num_extend reviews all praising how good this is . 
the magnets are strong as i have bumped them hard ,  and it just twisted ,  and didnt fall off . 
no more shutting off ,  no more touch screen issues . 
i ve tried tons of different pillows ,  supports etc . 
it comes with very good detailed instructions for cooking various foods . 
cost effective solution !  !  ! this is an excellent replacement without too much work . 
always saying we need a new can opener but never getting one . 
i bought this to exhaust smoke out of his bedroom window . 
a more detailed view on how the weather bug looks in the droid s huge num_extend
i found this item to be quite useful . 
and a stiff bristle paint brush to clean out the spout opening where the grinded coffee comes out . 
love using these tongs !  for the quality they are very reasonably priced . 
update july num_extend re moto droid : this product is fine for some items ,  but keep it away from your droid . 
i truly wish i had bought them years ago . 
we love this thing !  loaded with features ,  digital displays ,  handy controls and the convection oven feature is fast . 
however ,  once i move out i ll probably invest in some nicer cookware . 
she was tickled ,  and spent most of the time i was there ,  reading over it . 
he has used his since the phone came out and works construction and has never hurt his phone . 
unless you have an extra large toaster oven ,  it s not going to fit . 
i looked at just about every home center store around and could not find them ,  except for amazon . 
this is a good deal for the money ,  as it is capable of more than simply blending . 
i just bought another one here from amazon to replace one i have thats num_num years old . 
it is easier to manipulate and roll around freely . 
i saw a lot of review about bubbling . 
usb cord works well ,  never presenting a problem . 
on amazon you can afford to have a collection !  . 
the white usb cords works better in my opinion . 
it has a huge battery capacity with multiple charging ports ,  num_num amp and num_num amp . 
it is a great buy for any kitchen . 
i used itafter purchasing it two weeks ago ,  finally today for my easter dinner . 
this knife is just such a wonder to use that it s hard not to want to use it . 
the material they use is also very clean and perfect . 
the num_num inch and num_num inch rolls are both high quality and work great . 
the jaw falls of at times and is kind of iterating . 
what can you say about a phone battery ?  other than without it ,  you are dead in the water . 
the screen looks like it will last quite a long time and so far the functionality is great . 
i have sharpened it a few times with good results . 
the outer casing is like a hard plastic . 
this one loses extra points because the rivets are simply too large for a pan this size . 
does make a mess underneath it so use a towel or something to catch the crumbs . 
i may even buy a second one so that i have one upstairs and one downstairs . 
the carafe is kept heated for a couple hours . 
easy to use ,  great end results and fun . 
it is a great case until the holster starts cracking near the side clips .  .  . then it is time to replace . 
for some reason the bread is sticking to the space between the pan and the bottom of the paddle . 
it is a must have for any kitchen . save time and energy by buying this must have kitchen tool . 
this is the first stick vac i ve ever had ,  so i have nothing to compare it with . 
i have one of these at my cottage . 
i have not used for a while since i have a smarter cp . 
i find that just turning the thermostat into the hotter zone allows me to cook meat and veggies beautifully . 
at the same time ,  i purchased the griffin brand stylus for me for my kindle fire . 
and you can even make cookies on it . 
no more bending down to look at the line or lifting up the cup and having an off level . 
this was my first venture into skyping wireless ,  and i love it . 
complete with all the safety features ,  this pressure cooker works well . great num_extend stars if the regulator were better . 
then i gradually reduce the heat to low and the vent would keep on hissing . 
i started out with the num_num cup model of the cuisinart ,  which didn t even last a year . 
once the phone is apart they are exposed and quite vulnerable . 
it might depend on what i wanted to carry . 
in my experience the hot pan with cold oil approach has worked best to eliminate any sticking . 
this was given to us as a gift ,  back in the day when we used milk in our coffee . 
the bottom of the pan is solid and transmits heat quickly and evenly . 
didn t know at the time they were made of german steel . 
perfect for me !  !  ! i have had two very expensive meat grinders that i threw in the trash in frustration . 
this was a gift for my husband  ,  he has taken right to them and loves them . 
that is the issue i bought it to resolve . 
nice size for ceral and great for ice num_extend
i m still experimenting with all it can do ,  but my new favorite lunch item is chopped salad . 
take my word for it that it s hot !  !  . 
but if you re looking for a fairly small ,  inexpensive deep fryer this is a good way to go . 
orange juice from this thing is insanely awesome too . 
swype lets you trace out the letters of a word instead of tapping them . 
and i was surprised at how quickly shipped . 
all in all a very good deal ,  and a good price . 
here s my instructions for it :  put it on the bottle ,  push down gently while turning the screw top . 
the softer the meat ,  the more  mushy  the consistency will be . 
they are starting to trend in my office now . 
they hold the perfect amount for a late night drink with friends and are almost ridiculously solid . 
i also like that it is in metal so on temperature and leachilng concerns . 
i preheat the cup and then fill it and cap it right away . 
the first time i had coffee from one of thethese ,  i put my automatic drip pot away for good . 
i considered ordering new ones ,  but the old are in such good condition that i still don t need to . 
works great and comes with glues on it . 
get a tpu case or a seidio instead . 
i do not have to hand knead dough anymore !  . 
i always have problem to use knife to slice cheese . 
invest in this and you will save lots of time !  . 
gives your screen a bit of a rainbow effect tho . 
they feel funny in my ear and just always seemed awkward . i like this unit . 
it makes a lot of pops at a time . 
after seeing it in the store ,  i fell in love with the phone . 
the black sim card inserts do now work so well ,  but they do work . 
it stands up well and is very durable . 
i try using this feature with my car s gps and it usually works horribly . 
i m using a blackberry bold whose keyboard i prefer because the keys are less pointed on the bold . 
this is a great brush for use on vegetables . 
the inside is of a soft material to protect the screen . 
most of the time there is no meal service . 
we got one good one ,  and one not so good . 
this rolling pin is easy to use ,  especially for pie crusts . 
the only problem i have is the lid is difficult to put on . 
minus one star because these handy dishes are not for stove top . 
my apple iphone charger will not even power the blackberry . 
it only takes off what you want and not the pulp underneath . 
a very handy ,  easy to program ,  easy to hear timer . 
for now i am using it and loving it !  . 
like the little locking feature at the top . 
frozen vegetables are better than microwaved by %
it s very pretty ,  the material feels sturdy ,  it has pockets ,  and is machine washable . 
i have purchased others for freinds and family when they saw mine . 
or i can finish the chrust with out cooking the cheese anymore ,  if i want a more crisp crust . 
the plunger is fitted well ,  so there s less grind in your joe than with the cheaper ones . 
it washes up beautifully in the dishwasher and is basically something everyone needs to have in their kitchen . 
it has a good fast cutting grit and put razor edge on my kitchen knives in nothing flat . 
voices are clear and not at all muffled . 
did not have any issues with the seller . 
i like a smaller pillow that is on the firm side ,  but not too hard . 
the one complaint i have is that the bottom isn t flat . 
i had been looking for plastic fork for quite some time . 
i use this for pastry making and for some mashing . 
so now ,  when it hits medium ,  i just bring it into the house for the night to charge . 
included instructions are a little hard to understand . 
the first one i got did not work at all . 
i purchased this little skillet for my husband who likes to make one egg over lightly every so often . 
i have owned this product for two months and highly recommend it . 
i decided to buy these .  .  . these are good pair of samsung headphones for my samsung galaxy prevail . 
these are so cool ,  i didn t know they made such fun liners !  they re . 
the tops are good and go on well . 
i got it a week ago and i have used it twice so far . 
it does a great job on small meals . 
if you are going to get replacement belts ,  it pays to get the genuine panasonic ones . 
the ball bearings roll smoothly and do not catch . 
they are outstanding and fun to look at !  !  !  !  . 
i think it is worth the money based on the ease of use compared to blade grinder . 
she loves it ! oh and yes it makes noise when it is working . 
it comes out of the dishwasher like new . 
this brush has a scraping surface on the head and has outlasted most that i ve used . 
i own multiple chef s knives with varying quality . 
although it s small ,  it sucks up the dirt and grim easily . 
the holster rotates so the phone can be carried in various positions . 
it works fine for charging my ipad ,  although it won t charge a blackberry . 
this looks great sitting out on my countertop and doesn t take up a much room . 
this works better than an exterior float marker because it is more accurate . 
leave ti to corningware to protect me from my klutziness . 
you need it ,  you know it ,  now buy it . 
it won t clean up ,  but seems to be wearing off with time . 
i really like this whisk and it serves its purpose well . 
in the past we have always had a much larger one for our holiday turkeys . 
make sure you have all side panels up before snapping the top on . 
however ,  i have to sing its praises for the useful tool it was . 
there s a little more static than i m used to on inbound voice quality . 
a complete toaster oven and the quality is the best . 
and ,  it uses a standard micro usb charging jack so i can charge it with my phone s charger . 
it did arrive with a few scratches ,  but nothing that affects it s performance . 
cut really well and are very easy to clean . 
removal requires some work but nothing to be worried about . 
i walked all over my num_num st ft home and kept connected with no issues anywhere in my home . 
i disagree with some viewers that it is num_extend
this is a pot that you need in your kitchen . 
this works absolutely great if you want something low budget to use to froth your milk . 
it has all the necessary productivity software from windows and decent games . 
i wonder if that might not lead to some sort of problem in the future . 
i love metal measuring cups for one reason . 
well constructed ,  heavy pan ,  not flimsy like a lot of others out there . 
it s been great the several times i ve used it ,  and has really saved me in a bind  i . e . 
it s an easy fix ,  but caused a major issues for a while until i figured that out . 
since we eat a lot of garlic ,  this savings should pay for the press after about . 
 these measurements were acquired from an analytical scale in a laboratory . 
will try and update in few more months . 
or storing onions  ,  it is quite versatile and sturdy ,  would recommend this to everyone . 
this stays cleaner ,  it s comfy and can compress without getting bent out of shape . 
i lost my years old num_num at a sporting event . 
the cutting edge does not melt as it does on cheap tools . 
incredible value being in the medium price range . 
then i bent the wire so that the earpiece fits snugly into my ear . 
i grated my knuckle on a box grater once and it was pretty bad . 
no more !  this oven perfectly and evenly cooks our pizzas in num_num minutes or less . 
it has been almost num_num months now and it s going strong . 
i needed stainless steel as my hard anodized pan left scratches on my ceramic cooktop . 
i just can t get over how easy this corkscrew is to use . 
the recipes on the maker s website are inspiring . 
being a farm house ,  there was always something to pick up :  pet hairs ,  mud brought in  ,  crumbs . 
unlike my hand held mixer ,  i love to use my kitchenaid mixer . 
amazon price is awesome !  i bought num_num just because they were so cheap . 
this product not only protects my inspire it also gives it a fashionable look . 
it isn t perfect ,  but it s the best i could find in this price range . 
this allows you to make lots of juice . 
it is also much cheaper to use than a hand mixer . 
if it dies within its warranty period return it . 
even after six years ,  the knife is still reasonably sharp . 
i was making fudge when my thermometer broke . 
easy to install and easy to move . thanks for showing the itemkind regardsfrom ecuador . 
they are sturdy and stable for storing three tools . 
does hurt my ear when i wear it for long periods ,  but overall ,  i would recommend it . 
i used the turkeys with pie crust in the middle of my pumpkin pie . 
how nice to have all the adapters all in one place . 
it would have saved me a lot of headaches . 
best for smooth ,  dense cake mix like pound cake . ten cups . 
good enough suction ,  compared to useless oreck free canister vacuum . 
this is worth the extra money .  .  . it is by far the very best garlic press ever made . 
i was too nervous to buy this type of product for any seller other than amazon . 
it fits my regular and wide mouth mason jars without a problem . 
good price also . nice colors ,  good materials ,  very light . 
so this isnt the best waffle maker in the world . 
thankfully i haven t dropped it to test it ,  but it seems like it would be very protective . 
i have tried countless screen protectors and these by far have impressed me the most . 
just put it on the stove top on an open flame and it worked like a charm . 
it has a nicely formed ,  pointed spout which makes pouring liquids out of it a breeze . 
i got these to replace an older model plantronics over the ear bluetooth headset . 
after a week of using these knives she had to have her own . 
i am hoping this one holds up better . 
this blender jar base is not identical to the original . 
as an experienced and avid cook ,  i can attest to the versatility and craftmanship of this mixer . 
with steak and meats the grill works great with rubs and spices . 
i love farberware stainless and this is a great addition to my set . 
it went on easily with no bubbles and stayed on for about a year . 
i won t lie ,  this can opener took a few tries for me to be able to properly operate . 
i hate peeling garlic ,  and i use lots of it when cooking . 
this mount works very good to hold my iphone num_num in an otterbox defender case . 
i agree with everyone here that the tray should be bigger ,  or the larger tray attachment should be included . 
that s why i give it num_num stars instead of num_extend
they are nicely built ,  and they don t leave a finger oil on the screen . 
i m looking forward to enjoying it for a long time . 
the case gives easy access to all the ports while keeping them blocked from lint ,  etc . 
 hmmm ,  mine s wearing out so maybe i can talk one of them out of theirs . 
but for people who are not goingto use this as their main speaker ,  its good . 
and the the little studs or legs on the top of the lid . 
i bought this to froth my liquid creamer for my morning coffee . 
i recently moved and must have given my old one away ,  so i wanted to replace it . 
i m surprised how ell it actually works because of some negative reviews . 
i think i might buy a second one for my mother . 
it s a magnet type snap instead of velcro or snapping a button so that s pretty cool . 
not to mention years of physical work have left my hands too calloused for touch screens . 
that was probably my biggest concern when i decided to buy it . 
you won t know what i m talking about until you try to replace an iphone num_num screen with a phillips . 
if it breaks in a few months ,  i ll likely buy another of the same type . 
oh well .  .  .  .  .  . it works nicely as a charger adapter . 
i love the features and in spite of me .  .  . its toughness . 
the metal handle on the lid gets hot so you must be careful . 
so ,  for num_extend of coffee ,  i d use three tablespoons of beans . 
it heats up quickly and pops all of the kernels . 
at their loudest ,  they re just below where i usually listen to music . 
care must be taken to avoid touching hot surfaces with them as the nylon tips melt easily . 
this is by far the best whisk i have ever owned . 
i just had weight loss surgery and need num_num grams of protein a day . 
these turned out to be nice in the end . 
i love these drawer dividers !  i have two sets and they work beautifully . 
have tried the koenig type when visiting family and it tastes instant to me . 
just what i expected when i ordered it . 
that is ,  until i found this popcorn popper . 
if you get it at   .  .  .   it s only $ with free shipping . 
so far ,  i have purchased num_num packages in three shipments . 
yes i ordered a third tumbler ,  because i like it so much . 
they scoop out nicely with a rubber or silicone spatula . 
both layers give complete access to all of the new button and camera configurations . 
wonderful !  !  do not use the bag in the container method ,  but just put sugar in t\hecontainer . 
mine is finally on it s last legs so i am buying another . 
this otterbox case is just what i was looking for !  great protection for my iphone and attractive too . 
if you re a picky cook ,  then this is the set for you . 
it is truly crystal clear and you cannot tell it s on the phone . 
this spoon does the job ,  it s great quality and i just love the look . 
it s easy to use ,  easy to clean ,  and heats up quickly for that comforting cup of tea . 
but if you re cooking big pieces of meat you might want to try the larger one . 
i have had no troubles with this product and would recommend it to anyone . 
i priced this product locally and the price i paid ,  with shipping ,  was cheaper . 
schosche support was extremely nice and helpful and the wait time was just a couple of minutes . 
not the greatest protection but does the job . 
moving from a keyboard smartphone to an iphone i hated the screen keyboard at first . 
high quality item that does just what it says it will . 
it has a built in screen protector so no need to ever buy new ones and have bubble spots . 
great product ,  and the price is great for the quality . 
i use both navigation and gps apps which take a tremendous amount of battery . 
had it on my phone for a few months . 
my carpets look great and if i could give this cleaner num_num stars ,  i would . 
the controld also work flawlessly and you can contol just about everything from the headset . 
i installed these yesterday  very easy and a tight fit  ,  so only time will tell . 
does it work ,  look nice in the room . 
i likedesigned for apple num_extend output ac wall charger by powergen . 
first off ,  this is the best deal i ve found on these glasses . 
we used it several times this summer to recharge phones during power outages ,  and it s great for travel . 
i have probably num_num vacuum cleaners .  .  . all needing different bags types . 
great for making rice !  i use this all the time to make rice in . 
nice and shiny . when filled to capacity ,  it makes num_num mugs worth of coffee . 
i m hoping it will last a long time ,  as well . 
i really need to do that sometime to get better results . 
i have to cut the fabric up into manageable sized pieces to strain my pumpkin puree . 
the adhesive is very strong and they look very nice . 
i have had my regular classic set for num_num years . 
the original one i had from apple started fell apart . 
we also have riedel wine glasses which we enjoy as well . 
i bought this popper about num_num weeks ago . 
i ve also tried ge burr grinder and that was a nightmare and was a useless piece of junk . 
it has strong bristles and is very easy to handle . 
i like the settings for crispness and am still experimenting with the correct setting . 
eliminates the need to manually rotate your food items . 
it folds flat and small so you can easily store it . 
in the end i have the case to a friend when i sold him the phone . 
over time num_num of the bowls have broken ,  so i decided to try these as replacements . 
i was skeptical when i bought it ,  the price was good ,  i love it . 
i love this little machine !  the recipes are easy and pizzelles are delicious . 
i really agonized over this purchase since there are so many choices in so many price offerings . 
it might take a little practice to get the right grind for you . 
fast fast fast charge ,  like % to % in num_extend hours . 
this provides a holder in my shower for a washrag to dry between uses . 
this however is the best i have ever used . 
i will start by discussing its features grouped into several distinct categories . 
i have had several of these ,  and yes ,  i am very rough with them . 
this has a great built in music player . 
this case will help with that a lot . 
although each of these cases has perks ,  they all have drawbacks . 
i use it to grate nuts ,  peppermints ,  cinnamon candies and hard cheese on various preparations as a garnish . 
it doesn t make the rice creamy the way some restaurants do by adding starch . 
i ve made the perfect holder for the iphone .  .  . at least for me . 
while the textures on each have all been a little different they all rolled out beautifully with this machine . 
i had to go to companies to come in and clean for me . 
i purchased the okeba black rubber tpu gel hard case skin from amazon and received it in good time . 
i do not know if i can compare it to an otterbox . 
looks like they made it thinner to save costs . 
if that dimension was in the description ,  i probably would not have bought this . 
speaking of which ,  she says the tune belt is extremely comfortable for doing both . 
i even store dry pasta in the ball jars . 
it is an improvement and i am keeping it !  . 
it has been used almost daily and so far so good . 
i just microwave them for num_num or num_num minutes depending on size . 
i was tired of it always popping and making a mess . 
the knife has excellent heft ,  and generates a lovely  singing ring  when honing on a rod . 
it is a good size ,  comfortable handle ,  looks cute in your hand . 
i m thinking about buying this for my daughter in law now too . 
kinda sucks but what ever ,  this thing is top quality and lasts longer than the oem battery . 
i bought this saucepan for making lunch at work and have found it extremely useful and easy . 
i think i will still order the blue one and give this one as a gift when it arrives . 
they are made in switzerland and are nice and heavy and are very efficient to use . 
it work great and is easy to use . 
i purchased this several years ago from cooking . com . 
compare the price with other products to see this is a big bargain . 
easy to use and bakes a nice loaf of bread . 
henckels twin sharp duo knife sharpener as a gift for a friend . 
not a good case if you want it to last . 
this case fits my wife s iphone num_num perfectly . 
i paid $ for mine at macy s one day sale with a $ coupon . 
unplugged the jig ,  rebooted . no annoying yellow triangle ,  download counter is num_extend recommended . 
even the good ones start looking icky over time . 
this is not made clear even on the braun website . 
when mixing on speeds higher than level num_extend there is noticeable vibration from the machine . 
it seems that adding sufficient liquid is the key ,  as other commenters have noted . the blendtec is loud . 
we have a few acres and about num_num apple trees in our small orchard . 
this means it is sharper and holds it s edge longer . 
i make special pancakes for my little grand daughter and her friend when she visits . 
my only use of the steam wand is to dispense hot water for the occasional americano . 
in the past i used a fine diamond stone to get a respectable edge on my knives . 
the handle is better contoured and i think the blade angle is more appropriate for me . 
it fits any of my num_num kitchen sinks . 
this tells you exactly what is going on in the egg because it is actually cooking like one . 
i bought it after i bricked a phone by a drop from num_num feet . 
there s nothing nicer than a warm ,  dry ,  towel . 
in the morning when i just don t have time to steep a good cup of tea this works . 
based on the type of sticky tape ,  i don t think they d stick very well to some cupboards . 
i have many kitchenaid items in my kitchen and ,  as always ,  would recommend this to anyone . 
henckels fans and this is just another great product in their line . 
nothing wrong with them ,  i just like to replace them every few years . 
i wanted something lightweight with a small footprint to carry with me when i travel . 
love this juicer even more than when i first started using it . 
so that comes out to about $ per knife . 
easy to clean ,  easy to fill and it holds plenty of liquid . 
for me ,  it was a drastic move to put that more expensive elite away . 
maybe look for metal spacers to buy with it ,  but . 
the perfect small vacuum cleaner for every day . 
who would have guessed ?  the scale is reasonably priced and a huge asset to me . 
my family has complimented the design and operation of the kettle . 
yes ,  i m bad !  easy clean up and no problems . 
charged it up and appears to be holding charge as well as the battery that came with the phone . 
maybe a little large for serving brownies unless you like really big brownies . 
exactly what i ordered and exactly what i wanted . 
 think running a remote standard speaker set with your phone  . 
the pan is sturdy and the tin sides have had no issues with warping or buckling . 
it is one of my favorite kitchen items and still looks like new . 
one nice thing about this thing is that it is super easy to clean . 
i placed it in my closet last night and filled it up immediately . 
this was partially corrected with superglue and some blue tape . 
this item works but its not very precise . 
hard plastic ,  easy to remove ,  easy to clean ,  do their job . 
it has a superfluous laser pointer ,  which i have not found a use for . 
its pointy ,  so you have to grasp it carefully to plunge  or it will hurt your hand  . 
i never wanted or felt i needed a garlic press before . 
it works great and not very loud when in use . 
the jars works well in the freezer too . 
the shells come out as crispy as frying except there s no extra calories from oil . 
wash and dry your hands ,  clean the phone and go for it . 
we found this bag and it looked like just what we needed . 
this is much more sanitary . a great system ,  and it makes meal prep time ,  fun time . 
no obstructions in your line of sight . installation is easy . 
these cups from oxo are like all of the other oxo products i own :  quality . 
i use them to store homemade mixes ,  rice ,  brown sugar ,  etc . 
this hold all my fishing and hunting catalogs . 
but i still didn t really like using the attachment . 
it has two blades; a shredder and a slicer . 
the black and decker was so loud that i just couldn t use it anymore ,  it really hurt my ears . 
you wouldn t know it by looking at it but it does expand nicely and stores very coiled up . 
i ordered a bulk so i have some spare throughout the year . 
the swing arm makes certain that all your seeds pop . 
i was really skeptical about buying this battery ,  i thought it wouldn t work . 
i decided to try a smaller in ear earpiece rather than another large around the ear type . 
they made it that way for a reason . 
just use a seal from a used jar after washing and screw this plastic one on . 
place any lid on top but do not put on the ring . 
in spite of the extra weight ,  these have turned out to be wonderful . 
i can now get a signal in wyoming in locations i couldn t previously . 
i can keep my flour ,  sugars and many pantry items fresh for a very long time . 
i wanted a scoop that was about num_num tbs .  ,  but couldn t find one . 
this fits the phone and give me additional power to work with . 
you can read my review for this there . 
i bought this for my son s num_extend and work perfect from the begining . 
i love packing my lunch in my zojirushi . 
check on my customer images above just so you have an idea how the scarlet color really looks like . 
i m usually very picky about any sets hanging on my ear ,  but this one is pretty comfortable . 
as the name suggests ,  these are  flexible  boards . 
the pros are that the stand works well . 
my fave pasta to make is spinach flavored . 
i have been with tracfone for around num_num years now and have loved the phones they have put out . 
the sizes are in easy to see colors . 
we also have a milk frothing machine to go with it . 
this is the best tamper i had in a long time . 
this works great and i use it all the time for my phone and ipad . 
i bought it because i was not aware of where to get it locally . 
it is a must in my kitchen sincewe eat alot of salads and vegetables . 
but i trimmed it a bit to fit . 
i was a little embarrassed to learn just how easy it is to make yogurt at home . 
i don t have these batteries no more or the phones . 
got it much cheaper than the catalog here . 
i ve not had this problem with just oranges ,  btw . 
picture comparing the two pans on product description page . bon appetite !  . 
i bought a second one and keep it at my dad s house because i stop there frequently after work . 
choose larger fries or fries similar in size to those you get at macdonald s . 
we also dried an abundance of jalepeno peppers and made pepper powder . 
i am a coffee snob and i buy beans and mix my own blends . 
a lot of reviews said that the dishes had a lot of imperfections in the finish . 
the metal cup on top dented very easily after being carried in my backpack . 
it doesn t add a whole lot of bulk to the phone either . 
unfortunately le creuset discontinued this product after they acquired screwpull . 
summer in boston means any means of baking without heating the whole kitchen is great . 
now ,  excuse me while i go clean my sofa !  . 
this will come in handy because if you want unlimited texting or calling and i ll show you why . 
i bought two packages so num_extend of these and they work perfect . 
i purchased this as a classroom vacuum ,  but ended up using it in the art studio . 
its a great feeling waking up to the smell of bread in the morning . 
it served me well and was able to produce a final coffee cake for a coffee time . 
i ve had my machine for num_num months and have had no problem . 
the outside has become watermarked ,  but we live in a place that has hard water . 
i m not that hard on the phone either . 
definitely put the meat in the freezer for about an hour before grinding . 
i bought this for my verizon blackberry num_num and it works flawlessly . 
i bought this a few weeks ago and absolutely love it !  the cotton candy is so light and fluffy . 
i needed a thin ,  slender spatula and this one fit the bill . 
this is a great way to eliminate most of the fat from any broth . 
overall ,  i m quite pleased and hope that eureka continues to make these available for the long term . 
the coffee brews as hot as it should . 
put in place november num_extend and haven t had the need to touch it since !  highly recommend !  . 
both snap out of the machine very easily and clean just as easily . 
treat it right ,  love it real good and it will last you forever . 
as well ,  there are a ton of accessories available for the optimus v . 
mines lasted a year so its been worth the investment  cost me $ at the time  . 
quite decent sound for its compactness :  the midrange is clear and articulated . 
one drawback is the amount of grind that stays in the machine . 
if you push on the middle of the bowed side ,  it snaps right off or on . 
i was looking for a new dish rack for my kitchen . 
it s a shame it no longer carries the larger size ,  since filling the water tanks is a minor hassle . 
why buy a brand new battery when you can upgrade your phone soon enough ?  . 
it exceeded my expectations !  this mixer is truly the bad boy of mixers . 
num_num  cups  of espresso is not even one full cup of american coffee . there s no need to hesitate . 
also a couple of the num_num quart models are an added plus . 
i was using a body glove prior to getting this case . 
this is by far the best case i have found . 
the foot pedal feels very sturdy and reliable . 
i d heard the nightmare tales of canners exploding ,  etc . 
i have a dog at home that leaves her fur everywhere . 
after trying my friends i am so glad i did not get it . 
i m going to buy a second one just like it to have in my office at work !  . 
the rubber lid resists staining and the entire mug fits into a small space . 
i guess pushing this much current requires a lot of circuitry because it s a bit heavy and bulky . 
i had a little problem putting it on my phone ,  so it was nice to get a num_num pack . 
i plan on also using this burner with my wok . 
this works great and you need not worry about your non stick cookware . 
i already had a version of this product so i gave it to my girlfriend when it came . 
i m on my second ,  the first lasted several years ,  but was broken in a move . 
the bowl itself is sturdy and easy to handle . 
so i thought we d try something new and i think this is a pretty good pan . 
these are not made to chop tomatoes or other soft fruits . 
just a few small pictures on the box ,  but here is how it num_extend
i only use this to marinade meats for short periods of time . 
but every time you use the pan you preheat it and the heat kills all germs anyway . 
i should have gotten one of these years ago . 
but one call to dyson and they replaced it for free . 
a wonderful buy for my money !  thank you for a great product !  . 
since i wear hearing aids ,  i am extremely limited in what i can use . 
the case itself was nicked ,  but the phone was fine . 
normally whole limes can t be used because the skin is too tough and the seeds are too hard . 
i shopped around and this was hands down the best deal around ,  especially when they match my other cookware . 
did not grease pan ,  popovers popped right out . 
the milk has the potential to nearly quadruple in volume ,  so you ll need a tall mug or glass . 
this is a great one at a great price . 
no bitterness but full of fresh ground coffee flavor . i then decided it was time to make the switch . 
i have a cheap dehydrator but needed the fruit roll up sheets and found these . 
i read some reviews saying its not sturdy ,  well mine is ,  very nice design ,  no complaints . 
dosent feel cheap . this a really good smartphone that comes unlocked and has a great price . 
i don t know why i waited so long !  . 
the keys are textured and raised to make it easier to test . 
it s heavy ,  cooks evenly ,  and the cake slides right out with no sticking . 
i like it so much that i just got a second one .  .  . dedicated as a spice grinder . 
with this hard shell case my son cannot remove it . 
the vinegar cleans great and the smell goes away . 
this unit was a replacement item and is just perfect . 
it s big ,  it s durable and it works as well inside as outside on an open fire . 
anyway ,  i let them soak for about num_num min and wipe them off ,  rinse and dry . 
i use it mainly to bake my frozen bagels in it . 
i gave up on their  lifetime warranty  and bought this one . 
it does the warming and it s still small on the countertop . 
the containers themselves are glass and the lids are plastic . 
i compared the charger and wire that came with the phone to this one and they re identical . 
but it is a little flimsy for me . 
if you love fresh minced garlic ,  i would highly recommend this press . 
plus it is attractive enough to allow it to sit on the counter alongside our new processor . 
i ve had similar experience with other anker battery products so i m not surprised . 
they are very well made ,  even commercial in quality . 
i spray it with cooking spray before i scoop out the cookie dough . 
always have to keep pushing the phone back into the case so that it is flushed . 
compared with the num_num previous wireless headsets i bought . 
i use a smith s sharpening stone every num_num weeks or so to keep it sharp .  .  . takes a minute or so . 
this is absolutely the best case for num_extend
the shipping was very fast ,  and the product arrived in perfect condition . 
you can see the dirt building up in the clear canister . 
the mount is custom made for the droid x ,  so it fits like a dream . 
had to be replaced ,  as the bottom was no longer perfectly flat and we got a solid surface cooktop . 
now my cold cream ,  lotions ,  whipped spreads ,  puree s ,  and any number of items are easily stored and opened . 
this is my second purchase as i am slowly replacing my old ones with analon . 
would definitely recommend if the size is not an issue for you . 
this takes more effort ,  but the flavor is so much better . 
this is a great toaster for the money . 
this measurements come on a ring with rubber soft handles . 
shortcut keys !  there are quite a few shortcut keys on qwerty keyboard to control phone functions and inside applications . 
first of all the speaker is on the top while it s sound amplification is on the bottom . 
the top of the unit is removable; the phone slips right down into the inner frame . 
they all work well ,  but obviously the higher fat content ones tend to froth thicker . 
i just lean them out slightly when i check at the end of the day . 
i really liked that and used the heck out of it . 
so having looked at the pan ,  i came home and ordered it for $ no tax and free shipping . 
purchased this to keep my coffee pot hot . 
this has been a great addition to our kitchen . 
account holders wife here :  this is a great set of measuring spoons . 
nothing fancy ,  just a basica protector which is nice if you don t have one . 
been using them for couple months now and haven t plugged it up . 
i bought the ice cream attachment and love that too . 
if you want a lid to fit the num_num quart stainless saucier this is it . 
a good friend gave me one of these as a gift in the num_extend
everyone had a great time and it worked perfectly . 
again ,  it s seemgingly large size belies the comfort one experiences while wearing this headset . 
it s opened new ways of cooking for us and it s been a fun and delicious experience . 
it greatly improved the taste of our yucky water . 
bluetooth headsets do contain a weak radio transmitter ,  so they could transmit some radiation . moshi moshi s are a weird beast . 
she was very excited to have quite a selection of decorating tips ,  since she is just a beginner . 
they sent it out promptly and it worked perfectly . 
has a good magnet on the back to hold it onto a metal surface . 
maintains an even heat as you make multiple num_extend
the rice comes out perfectly every time ,  never sticks . 
i like it because i dont really use the phone very much  :   . 
we wanted a smaller one to save counter space ,  since we usually make small amounts of coffee anyway . 
other than that the product is sturdy great i love it for num_num bucks what else do you want . 
it does not leak !  !  !  i m so grateful !  !  thanks !  . 
if i can figure out a way to use the kitchenaid ,  it gets used . 
one of the sexiest looking phone i ve seen . 
would recommend to anyone thinking of such a purchase . 
i returned the first grinder at my own ignorance . 
stairs etc , just a great sweeper for a very reaaonable price , im happy happy ,  . 
it s quiet in the house right now . amazon shipped this thing to me fast . 
this little machine is a godsend for dicing vegetables . 
i always have to pour my coffee and then put it in the microwave . 
it was heating inside for almost an hour and half when i put the first naan inside . 
this will work on most all droid and htc phones . 
you wouldn t think something like this would be so handy !  i use them as coasters . 
nice big size ,  suitable for smaller or larger pans . 
the only part i don t like is the little handles . 
they both have nice heavy solid handles that are riveted on . 
it seems to be reasonably well made ,  and doesn t feel cheap . 
it was on the couple s registry so we decided to send it to them . 
my phone fits in it and it makes it appear new again ,  even if it s a very old phone . 
typical battery charger ,  but i do like the light it comes with to indicate charging status . 
worried about the cost of repairs ,  i got out a counter top convection oven i had in storage . 
using the same screwdriver ,  locate the num_num screws holding the circuit board down and remove num_extend
i m not particularly tech savvy ,  but i rely on skype to regularly keep in touch with family overseas . 
you don t have that problem with this set . 
the keys are very tactile and although a little close together ,  pretty easy to type with . 
i will most likely buy another one in the future for another part of the house . 
if you have it sideways ,  you have a choice to point the sound up or down . 
it can go from around num_num all the way to num_extend
it all started with a video about how to make a bloomin  onion . 
for the price and the quality ,  these earphones can t be beat . 
i was a bit skeptical and was scared to fully test it out but hopefully this helps your decision . thanks !  . 
this product is so amazingly awesome for the great price . 
love it !  this is a n easy to operate and easy to clean product . 
my wife bought a competitive unit at a cheaper price . 
i had a pressure canner many years ago . 
then i have to keep it charged ,  and they all seem to be the in ear mounts at $
what more can you ask of a thermos ?  great product ,  great brand . 
it makes dessert really special when the kids help . 
just put ours up yesterday ,  it seems very small but it is in fact num_extend long . 
i especially like the little scoop on the side that lets you scoop out potato eyes while you re peeling . 
it makes a very impressive cake that always gets a lot of compliments . 
i debated doing so initially ,  but because of limited storage space i bought this one . 
i ve used similar rings in the past and often found that they did not last well . 
this is my first braun coffeemaker and i m very happy with it . 
i bought two of these and we use them as garden hods . 
it s lightweight ,  and it narrow enough to leave on your counter without taking up too much space . 
i tried another batch the following day with a single layer of jars and it went quicker and better . 
this is my first bluetooth device ,  and it has been nothing but a positive experience . 
but with this tea maker the whole process is tremendously more convenient ,  easier and faster . 
it is heavy glass ,  heavier than i expected ,  which is good . 
this model isnt particularly sleek or classy ,  but it casually nice . 
it s not difficult but it does take time . 
this is true for the noise isolating headphones . 
i own several different types of this grater . 
this from someone who hasn t had much luck with oxo in general . 
being using this one for my home made greek yogurt and it works like a charm . 
i broke the first case already but i m glad i got num_extend
most of the irons i looked at did not have an indicator light saying when the waffle was done . 
this case will protect your phone from any drop and the colors are cute . 
i always like the piece that goes down in your ear more than the circular kinds . 
it s not quite comfortable enough for me to just leave it in there all day . 
i will never use a hand mixer again . 
mine worked fine upon arrival and still works well . 
it comes out kind of weak compared to other steamers i ve used . 
this headset is not even refurbished ,  but is used . 
fabulous for scooping items out of hot water . 
it is the sturdiest scoop i have come across so far . 
it now includes a pour spout on either side of the rim . 
it is true ,  the coarseness adjustment feels light and easy to dislodge . 
i use it for nav and music ,  etc . 
if you are looking for a truly international phone that rocks ,  this is it !  . 
but if you like having mini heart attacks every twenty  or so  minutes ,  i definitely recommend !   ; . 
i keep it in the freezer ,  in a sealed container ,  until i am ready to grind it . 
if you want good phone capabilities and email ,  then this is the phone for you . 
its a very nice design ,  with a soft rubber part and a hard plastic part that fits over it . 
i am planning to add the num_num drink glasses and maybe more to the collection . 
worked fine for me when i used for christmas cookies . 
keep them num_extend keep an extra gasket just in case . 
makes a very easy ,  very good cup of coffee . 
 kind of gross ,  and might be a real problem for someone with immune issues or special susceptibility to bacteria . 
this is one of the smaller sweepers ,  fitting into some smaller places . 
i have two of these ,  and i purchased two more for other people i know . 
she does not tolerate the commercial nutrition ,  but does well with her customary food . 
the outer protector is as described ,  but the screen protector is useless . 
this one has a easy grip handle and simple to clean then dry . 
this is a well made ,  strong wooden drawer organizer . 
i tried all types of mj  morning joe ,  ahem  to hit that right balance of flavor ,  price ,  and effect . 
ok ,  it s june and you are being hit up for present after present and you are on limited funds . 
i recommend the slicer if you don t mind some cleanup annoyances . 
i am current aging a num_num month romano cheese ,  not a waxed cheese . 
i give these num_num stars because they are sturdy ,  well made and the lids fit well . 
it cooks things much more evenly than a round or square pan where the middle can be gooey . 
it will not improve coverage inside your entire home ,  floor ,  etc . 
i really just don t understand where he s coming from . 
mine sits on a try ,  on kitchen counter . 
we have used it daily for num_num years and now the electrical connection has become spasmodic . 
i was a little leery of this ,  as it s a chinese product . 
these work well for the purpose intended and are large enough so that they aren t easily lost . 
now i use the dang filters as recommended . 
i ve had other blenders that have died in a few short month ,  one conked out in a couple weeks . 
i just pinch in and they stay ,  because of the shape . 
sleep deprived me made that mistake ,  but thankfully i fixed it . 
i use it for poached eggs as alternative to the frying pan . 
the longer you keep the frother in the milk ,  the thicker the milk gets ,  up to a certain point . 
this redesigned case has advanced rubber properties ,  compared to previous versions . 
simple to use both for pressure cooking and for sauteeing . 
was surprised as they were smaller than i expected . 
this is yet the best rice cooker ,  but it doesn t cook just rice; there is porridge ,  oatmeal ,  even cake . 
i have it running all day and it hasn t failed yet . 
it remains unrusted and otherwise in it s original state as the day i purchased it . 
i ordered a bamboo brush to clean it with and it cleans up wonderfully . 
it was about half as expensive as the second ,  labelled with the culinary institute of america brand . 
these wusthof knives are treasured for their quality and never put in the dishwasher . 
even the other knives could cut through bread without buying this knife . 
this issue certainly isn t enough to prevent me from recommending the case to others . 
it has been a reliable device with decent battery life . 
bags are less expensive at the above retailer too . 
most important , it makes coffee and hot tea very fast and very well . 
i use this wok as my main frying pan . 
the black knob on top got soft and loosened from its mounting screw ,  never to fit tightly again . 
this is a great pan for meatloaf and i am thoroughly enjoying it . 
acehardware never did let me know ,  but you did for them . both credits were quickly entered . 
received in timely manner ,  boxed with other items . this is a fairly heavy meat pounder . 
i have a baby just beginning to crawl . 
you can lift the lid to see when it s done . 
i use this strainer as i prepare meals every day . 
they wash easy and are not too heavy to lift . 
i was expecting a hard plastic all around case but this covers the back and side . 
also ,  the lid will fold completely back and flat for open grilling . 
i m not sure if the older version was a num_num or num_num without the + but .  .  .  . love these headphones . 
they are easy to store and easy to clean . 
i got this because i thought that it would be a fun item to have around . 
i ve used them for a month now and they re still doing great . 
our principal concern was whether the coffee would stay hot in the insulated carafe . 
this is a definite must for anyone with a lot of knives  like myself  . 
i ll be taking it along when my wife and i travel so we ll have a good bedside clock . 
at first ,  i found it difficult to pour water into the well without spilling any . 
even cooking and left nice grill marks the first time out . 
i have to say the range is pretty good . 
only num_num stars because the grating holes wrap around the edges so it s easy to scrape yourself . 
so its only cost $ for a beautiful cookware set . 
took num_num minutes to install and clean up the mess that had been annoying me for months . 
it has really came in handy a few times . 
this type of roller is handy for rolling out pizza dough or flattening cookie crust in a pan . 
i then saw this cheap kit and thought ,  what the heck . 
the size is perfect to fit in a pocket or purse . 
this is perfect for that . the jabra is wonderful . 
this press ,  on the other hand ,  is solid metal and has a fantastic heft to it . 
for this money it is a great purchase . 
i ordered this because my battery stopped working and i needed a replacement . 
all i need are good beans ,  ground very well ,  and an attentive ear . 
this keeps your bra hooks from snagging your sweaters in the washing machine . 
these glasses look good ,  are durable ,  and hold a lot of liquid . 
and ,  if i m not careful about it ,  the music just starts blaring out of the phone . 
this purifier helped in both areas . third ,  do not underestimated the noise this unit generates . 
this pan is very high quality and arrived ahead of time . 
had i done that ,  i would have returned it in a timely manner and saved some money . 
as others have noted ,  these things seems to be very well built . 
i just wish i knew if it was made in the usa or not . 
can use it on gas or electric ranges . 
it works well and most of the spices that came with it are common users . 
it is original and i have not had any problems with it at all . 
it doesn t make the horrible loud grinding noise that i m used to . 
they re thin and light ,  but replace heavy cutting boards and still get the job done . 
crema did reappear just before the num_num cup mark but it was marginal . 
i ve been quite happy with it ,  and came to amazon for thesmallandmediumsizes . 
so they re great ,  i loved them ,  just make sure you are aware of this little detail . 
i can affirm that they are accurate except that the playback time is not the num_num hours claimed . 
will have to see how the units weather over time but so far ,  so good . 
if you do it this way ,  its not a problem and doesn t affect how securely the phone is held . 
i had never had a kitchen aid before . 
it makes a great tasting pot of coffee . 
im just sorry that this unit may become obsolete soon as cuisinart is always upgrading their products . 
lots of bling .  .  .  .  . even more than i exptected from the picture online . 
i didn t go with a presto because i have an electric stove . 
such a better cup of coffee than the drip type . 
and also i fill the coffee maker from my brita pitcher . 
it is exactly what i needed to charge my samsung phone while traveling . 
and ,  they d make a terrific present for any foodie on your list . 
i put it in the oven for num_num degrees for num_num hours and it came out great . 
it is loud ,  but effective and makes a difinitive statement against dirt . 
initially i was very excited knowing the phone improvements would make it even better . 
my only issue is a small design change that has a huge impact . 
i borrowed tips and ingredients from various sources ,  created a wet mixture and dry flour mixture . 
great size ,  it fits myhand just fine and i had no problem with the locking feature either . 
she has not had any problem with her flash since putting this on her iphone either . 
i hangs on my pantry door and annoyingly clunks every time i open it . 
i have a very low wattage microwave and start with num_num min . 
you get microwave crispiness without the oil and high cost of the microwave bags . 
this is a niche use for a niche phone ,  but it s exactly what i was after . 
if you love garlic ,  you owe yourself this excellent tool . 
these are very nice for the price and are already put to use . 
my hands did not get wet as other reviewers claimed . 
this heavy duty pan is my choice over any other num_extend springform pan . 
i just bought the second to hold ezpass while using the other for gps . 
everything i would expect from plastic lids too . 
i chose this product because of a number of factors . 
raised rubber edges keeps your screen safe from table tops . 
he things it s so cool that is folds as well . 
it is solidly built and the coffee tastes much better !  keeps it nice and hot ,  too . 
i have cooked so many things in it i can t list . 
looks ,  works ,  feels like my parents old air popper from the num_extend
i ve seen chargers that cost num_num times as much not looks this nice . 
or so  ,  so if you re looking for something for multiple people go for a bigger press . 
i am now hooked on cast iron and love this num_extend skillet and the num_extend skillet . 
as long as you are using your headset then the light will indicate that you are on the phone . 
i bought this cell phone for my granddaughter and she just loves it . 
no big deal ,  but it would be nice to have wheels . 
it keeps the sugar tightly sealed and we re also able to pour sugar into a cup fairly easily . 
i also wish the unit allowed for radio presets ,  because i often toggle between num_num different npr stations . 
it s convenient and large enough to hold all my knives ,  scissors and honing stone . 
otherwise ,  it might be a little too small for a standard cake pan . 
i hardly ever make meatloaf for the reason of it can be greasy . 
it cools down fast after being in the microwave . 
i sorted the appiance via customer reviews and this one caught my eye . 
i don t wash it in the dishwasher ,  finding that hand washing works just as well . 
i use it primarily for frying and it maintains the heat perfectly for large batches of fish or chicken . 
i have used it for a cheesecake  see warren brown s ,  cake love ,  pumpkin cheesecake  . 
the website has plenty of photos and free information that supliments the included booklet . 
bonus :  it also makes it all happen much quicker ,  so prep time is shortened ,  yay !  . 
it can easily hold two to three of those lipton noodle packets . 
i have been looking for a honey server for a long time with no luck until now . 
wonderfully made ,  printing was lined up and i still use it till this day . 
i purchased a small plastic bin from our local dollar store and all the parts fit in there nicely . 
my primary use is making smoothies and this blender gets the job done . 
used it on and off when husband had to periodically use an oxygen concentrator . 
the plum was actually my first fiesta purchase . 
on its own ,  it is a work of art handing on the kitchen wall . 
i tried to center it with my galaxy s num_num camera lens . 
i also take a moment to dry the edges . 
this is the filter recommended for my bunn brewer . 
i have this and the super fine model and these two seem sufficient for % of my grating needs . 
however ,  please be informed that the handles on this pot do get hot ,  as does the lid handle . 
i own both silpat and the exopat ,  and they are identical in every way but price . 
second ,  num_num minutes or so before you pull the buns out of the oven spray them with cold water . 
works great when you on the go and need to setup a small work station . 
it is not too heavy to keep in my cupboard and bring out when i need it . 
the spoons are deep and nice to cook with . 
don t forget to get a bottle brush to clean it . 
he was very pleased when we were able to find another one to replace the old one . 
it has saved the phone many times from various drops . 
i had purchased this previously ,  and it completely died after about three weeks . 
my large food chopper broke so i purchased this one . 
and finally ,  we don t care a fig about how good or bad a storage box looks . 
i had purchased other over the ear bt headsets ,  but they were too tight and hurt my ears . 
if you still have the original ipad ,  i would recommend this case . 
the flaps don t always stay closed when son has phone in his pocket . 
we used it the first day to grind two bags of coffee into a ziplock bag . 
the online instructions don t call for this ,  but it is my preference . 
it is so great ,  even if it is hard to remove . 
i rate the num_extend external battery pack at num_num stars . 
because i have found this maker does make a good quality sturdy scoop . 
this is ideal for a teenager s use and for traveling . 
we like to entertain and eat out by our pool ,  and these clips work the best in my experience . 
if anything happens to change my rating ,  i ll edit and update my review . 
it s the right size for a large pot . 
there is a large variety of recipes from simple ,  to fancy . 
i love the design ,  and that gets it num_num stars . 
it takes time to research all these information . 
our house is cleaner and the air is cleaner also since the filters capture the fine dust particles . 
also ,  i can put this thing in without removing from the case ,  but its not the best feeling fit . 
very easy to put on and take off . 
when using my motorola flip bluetooth headset ,  people always complain . 
it is small enough to fit into my pants or jacket pocket . 
sadly not available anymore or i would have bought a few more of them . 
i only wish they came with a more versatile ring to hold them together . 
very sturdy and well built  hard to believe it s the same company  . 
i ve found hand washing is important; you don t want any grease on your fingers . second step ,  clean the screen . 
a complete set of items and a full compliment of options makes light work of most efforts . 
my only problem was that i thought it came with chairs until i read someoneelses review .  .  .  .  .  .  . live and learn . 
this is a great kit because everything you need is included . 
this is a great paring knife and i also own other henckel knives . 
thin slices is perfect for making potato chips ,  and the thick slices are great for tomatoes . 
but all in all ,  great product ,  service ,  and i m happy with it . 
even though the back scratches fairly easily ,  i highly recommend this case . 
work slow and carefully ,  and it will come off just fine . 
i like to grind my own coffee and make it with this press . 
we are real happy with this for sure . 
i ve used this charger with multiple phones that have the same connector with no issues . 
we are happy with the unit and would buy another . 
opera mini and even firefox mobile are available for num_extend
the order was processed and delivered fast ,  even though i had several different items in the order . 
this is important because it s a tight fit . 
i use it often when listening to music !  i recommend it . 
as a side note ,  the king arthur mix is good ,  but not a strong sourdough . 
it works great on the floors ,  and is easy to move around ,  with a very long cord . 
mined salt contains moisture which will cause a build up in the grinding mechanism . 
the pan scrapers did do their job ,  it just took a little longer . 
i don t mind chores like that !   :  definitely ,  num_num stars for a great electric knife sharpener from presto !  . 
i purchased the stx model and the heater broke within two weeks . 
if the one i have ever dies ,  i will buy another one without hesitation . 
i just got the samsung galaxy note which is a large phone ,  like a gps device you could say . 
cheap and effective for what it is designed for . 
it d be great if you can reply to an email or text with your voice . 
again the hammer rose ,  the chicken breast silently pleading for mercy . 
this case is very sturdy ,  has an excellent feel and is not too bulky to stick in a pocket . 
add a bit more water and yeast though . 
i like the handle and weight of this grater ,  but it s really only for hard cheeses like parmesan . 
i usually dial out on the phone ,  and receive calls using the num_extend
simplicity is great ,  but they took it a bit too far . 
this charger for me has been convenient ,  yet annoying . hope this helps . 
i m glad i bought this ,  i needed something to hold all my flour and this works great . 
a great option if you would rather go wired on your handset . 
tried to cook per instructions on the box ,  but middle still stayed somewhat liquid . 
in addition ,  sanyo seems to have thought of and included every useful feature . 
this made them a bit more affordable ,  and quick if you need one right away . 
they are very sharp and sturdy ,  showing no signs of defect . 
i just keep my phone hooked up to it and keep it charged . 
i got such a good price on a set of num_extend i bought num_num sets . 
i have a screen protector already so i didn t use the one that came with the case . 
the color was great and has great texture which helps with gripping . 
have used it for num_num months now ,  and no problems . 
my only issue with this one is first the protective screen is alittle bit of a pain . 
unfortunately the blade area has discolored from rust a little . 
the espresso is a bit weak ,  but it is a $ machine and not a $ machine . 
if you have a num_extend or num_extend this battery is really worth the price of admission . 
when i bought this unit it was labeled num_num cups and held a little more than num_num cups . 
very nice and they asked for my serial number and offered to send me a replacement battery . 
since i use gas ,  they collect a bit of soot ,  but almost all of it washes away easily . 
i really like that it is easy and safe to use . 
 oem  isn t sufficient anymore and most of the non brand name stuff is junk . 
i use this all the time now for my cookies . 
all in all ,  though ,  i consider it $ very well spent !  . 
the froth is so thick it can stand far above the rims of the serving cup . 
i don t know what else you could want . p . s . 
this review was worth $ so i think highly of it for the price . 
i checked ,  and checked ,  and checked again to make sure i had the right one . 
overall ,  i am very pleased with its performance . 
i am on the road quite a bit and use this for my incoming calls only . 
in fact ,  i have ordered a third one  in a different color  for my iphone . 
i finally came across this one and it is great . 
the microplane grater makes the task easy and enjoyable and of course fresh cheese has the best flavor . 
i have num_num of these in different sizes and use them all the time . 
the tray with the spice screen has to be hand washed but it cleans up well . 
purchased by a friend bu i must say that it looks like a well made holster . 
i like the durability of the otterbox cases . 
this makes it wind betterthird ,  the cable is thin . 
clipped the connector off and used my own connector and off to the races it went . 
this is such a great thing !  i give them as gifts now . 
it  holds  the connection for about num_extend in case you want to continue using siri . 
this is a nice humidifier and i really appreciate the large tank opening for ease of cleaning and filling . 
this product will not sharpen dull knives ,  but it will keep sharp knives in great cutting condition much longer . 
this is a very handy ,  well made canister vacuum . 
it doesn t wobble on the container you put it on for straining . 
not meant to compare various brands ,  i purchased what appeared to be the best based on amazon customer reviews . 
i have num_num so when one is charging i can easily use the other . 
kitchenaid stand mixer before christmas and decided i needed a few attachments to make my splurge more worthwhile . 
google it .  .  . it s how you use a pizza stone . 
i was doubtful about getting two sets of these ,  but i am glad i did . 
originally ,  i only thought of it as a convenience . 
we purchased this for our housemate ,  for christmas num_extend
this item was exactly what i needed to store my silverware . 
this spoon is big ,  however it works great . 
i am totally amazed that this food chopper evenly chops or purees from top to bottom . 
i really like it s height for those taller cans . 
i opted for the num_num piece set instead of the num_num piece set . 
i don t think there is really much more i need to add to what people have already said . 
it will work with any decanter not over num_extend
i plan on applying the oil once a month to try to increase my boards lifespan . 
a three layer might be a little tall . 
they slide right off ,  even the ones that have sticky chocolate chips oozing . 
i also like the fact that it doesn t take up too much space to store it . 
this is the second replacement blade we ve gotten for our trusty old blender . 
this means a shorter lifetime with  memory effect  than if they had used one of the newer nimh batteries . 
i don t know if it sticks or not since i used parchment paper with it . 
came in early ,  but i wish in the description it mentioned that it didn t have the plastic screen protector . 
this is representative of the entire phone operation . 
it works well with the cover stand which i also bought . 
we control whether we are going to fry them in grease or cover them with salt and other spices . 
i have found that is keeps a cake moist as well . 
i like the measurement guide on one side of the blade . 
however ,  i ve become less willing to accept that limitation recently ,  and decided to try to find a solution . 
these are definitely gonna take a bit of getting used to . 
these need to be scoured out with comet after washing the pot . 
i ve found this to be a very versatile appliance . 
i purchased this set for my niece as a christmas present . 
a good knife for slicing onions ,  lemons or anything smaller . 
i chose this one because it is taller and more narrow than most colanders . 
it is secure storage and keeps food fresh . 
pandora and google music  beta  sound good with these and calls are clear and crisp . 
and you kinda  want a grinder that won t break . there are surprisingly few grinders sold that meet these requirements . 
internally this is a blackberry ,  through and through . 
powerful and maintains suction until bag is full . 
i chose it because of the size since i was planning to use it for bread and pizza . 
super easy installation if you know this little trick . 
i see no problem with the plastic percolator top . 
yippee ! this seems like a very well made fan . 
i ve had it for about a month and no problems at all . 
i bought these as a present for my father . 
be sure to use the funnel like instructions say so water doesnt spill . 
update :  i find that i have the fewest unpopped kernels when i use peanut oil . 
i have went through num_num of these already !  !  !  !  !  !  !  . 
does a fine job of keeping bacon from curling  if such is your desire  . 
they gasp with surprise at how well it slices . quality is worth the price ,  and wusthoff is true quality . 
i ve had this mixer for about num_num years now and i use it on a daily basis . 
i was surprised when i opened the package and saw how big this knife is . 
the amount of main memory is num_num mb ,  which is more thanenough for multitasking on this phone . 
as someone who was constantly losing her earbuds while exercising ,  i can t tell you how much i appreciate this . 
i bought this for my senior trip to florida to keep my iphone num_extend charged . 
no leaks from lids or pans breaking for us so far . 
i also like the fact that we were given the back protector as well . 
i have num_num of these brew and go machines and use them everyday . 
i like the bigger screen since i use the internet alot . 
i keep the tank in my fridge and use it for coffee water and drinking water . 
replaced a factory battery so the phone would stay on longer and it worked . 
that s where this little handy dandy device comes in hand . 
however ,  it required that the height of the shelf space be enough to accomodate this feature . 
it s nice and heavy and is up to whatever task a large mixing bowl is needed . 
also ,  i was happy to find a set that comes with glasses instead of mugs . 
he drinks a gallon or more of water each day ,  so he will definitely be changing the filter . 
i have this charger by my nightstand and plug my phone in all night . 
i bought this for my gift shop to display rings on . 
i m not sure why there were not holes added for the volume buttons . 
i always bring it when i go out camping if im going to fish . 
this is a amazing dock to have for the price . 
this holder is great because it s adjustable to several devices . 
i rec d red and white colored pans and not what is pictured  dark gray  . 
this is amazing .  .  . very convenient ,  i could bring this everywhere with me . 
would love to get an oem again but seems it is too much to wish for . 
i like these ,  they are good quality and it was a one stop purchase . 
i only use these on my cast iron skillet as i fear the stainless steel rings may scratch teflon . 
lo and behold ,  the sloppy joes were amazing . 
it seems like it gets better the more you use it . 
this was the second one we had and the first one onlylasted three months . 
i love this shelf ,  in fact i want another one for washer . 
we bought this because it was a best buy from america s test kitchen .  .  .  . or one of the cooks recommendations . 
the sound quality is good  do not expect it sound like bose  . 
i can t see how you can get them off without slopping hot soup . 
and then i hang it over the oven handle to dry . 
it really does go right through it with minimal effort and it makes nice even slices . 
your eyes will light up the first time you taste the difference . 
it holds my heavy coats well and keeps things i don t have a place for off the ground . 
i doubt it s ability to do whipped cream though . 
these headphones are comfortable and stay in place when you re working out or out working in the yard . 
since installing this in my car ,  i have dropped roughly % fewer calls . 
i finally decided to try it after reading the reviews in cooks illustrated . 
takes about num_num min to brew or you can delay the start time . 
we are downsizing as our adult children are leaving home and i am learning to cook for two again .

two full weeks have gone by ,  and no response at all . i also tried calling them on the phone . 
the other problem is that you have to use one of your own cables . 
it does what its suppose to do ,  doesn t burn or stick to the pan or to the cakes . 
i bought this lid for my num_num inch circulon skillet . 
i love it and getting three for the affordable price listed was a plus .

in a normal house i m sure they would last forever . 
smooth flow ,  pleasing fonts ,  beautiful colors and shadows .

corrosion will definitely have an effect on the connectors . 
i was concerned about the thickness and durability . 
the thin glass ,  to me ,  adds to the charm . 
after the carpet was done i allowed it to dry for a day and the whole room smelled wonderful . 
now everybody sitting next to you on the train ,  bus ,  bench ,  class ,  waiting room ,  etc . 
i do wish the item weighed less overall ,  but i do think it is because of the rugged construction . 
i would have paid double after receiving it .

with the voyager pro ,  just loop around the ear ,  move the mic boom ,  and it will stay on .

no problem holding a charge ,  lasts just as long as the original one did . 
i like both colors and they both go good with my original iphone . 
and it is easy to thoroughly clean it since every part can be immersed in sudsy water . 
these are excellent for the price ,  went on easy good quality for cheap screen protectors and fit perfect . 
not a scratch and it still worked perfectly . 
it worked ok with some problems ,  but i decided to buy the red refurbished model from amazon . 
others want to know where i got it i don t want to tell them so they cannot copy me . 
i did a lot of research before buying the jiffy steamer . 
unlike the travel version ,  this has a plug to ensure it does not leak or back out . 
this is one of the handiest pans i use in the kitchen . 
it works perfectly and is so very well made . 
a very handy sweeper all in all for a great price !  . 
when this ballistic case arrived ,  i realized there was nothing wrong with the otterbox case . 
i m very pleased with the balance and feel of it . 
it is designed to be used when you re holding an object in one hand and cutting with the other . 
i have used similar items like these in the past and they work good . 
of course pyrex brand cannot be beat either . 
stacks well and is a good value for the money . 
i am never going back to hard baking dishes . 
im happy to say that the smell has gone completely . 
have some in my desk at work just to hand out !  love em !  !  . 
i have wanted one of these for a long time . 
i also use it to perfectly remove stems from strawberries without damaging the berry . 
this helps if you are transporting something that is rather liquid . 
i have dropped the plates ,  no breakages ,  but the bowl wasn t as lucky . 
i ve even started working out on my elliptcal again . 
this is not a problem if you store your items in containers . 
oxo tools are pretty all i buy now . 
on the new one ,  you press the noise assassin button . 
this should have been a num_num piece set and then everything would store better . a overall . 
it may just be the last one you will ever need . 
i am always charged up now !  if i could give this more then num_num stars i would . 
it fits my evo perfectly and it even comes with screen protecters that sprint so graciously applied for me . 
maybe the charge built up over the winter ,  when it was dry . 
thats what i have had on my phone for a while now . 
i have scrambled eggs ,  cooked passta sauces and for me the great test  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . custard . 
excellent product !  i needed this for my car !  fast shipping !  thanks !  fits my iphone and ipod perfectly . 
so the box has unused space for unincluded attachments and no space for a very sharp included attachment . 
we don t buy coffees from them regularly anymore ,  but now buy beans instead . 
this will save money in the long run and it s much more environmentally friendly . 
the phone has a beautiful time display ,  weather display and quite a sense of humor too . 
i haven t tried these on heavy bread dough yet . 
the jabra num_extend is not perfect ,  but does suit my needs . 
my friend has this same case and paid almost $ for it . 
i bought this case to hold my lg optimus one phone . 
i haven t tried to make the  french fry  cut but it is supposed to do that as well . 
i purchased this on amazon six years ago . it has a little bit of rust ,  but its still going strong . 
i also put my tablet in an otterbox . 
it will not survive a accidental knock and will come crashing down on the kitchen floor . 
the ball swivels to a large degree ,  so i don t need to bend the gooseneck much . 
if the meat sticks ,  it will unstick as it carmelizes  this also applies to their grilling skillets  . 
it works quickly without a lot of effort . 
i think inebriated guests will be less likely to break these . 
this was a replacement order after i didn t get it from best n price . 
it was a little pricey but seems to be worth the money . 
the speakers can be turned up very loud . 
i received the moshi moshi to use with my iphone num_num and also microsoft lync communicator on my laptop . 
i ordered several of these for storing items in my closet . 
they hold a full two cups of food . 
hence ,  you ll pay a pretty penny for what i think is too much . 
i m sure that s not the best for it . 
they clip together on a sturdy ring and are easy to keep track of . you can t go wrong with these . 
the phone goes in easily and automatically secures itself . 
it seems to be built to last  my $ farberware set is num_num years old  . 
great pizza pan ,  and works as a large griddle . 
it has been knocked over several times on my desk at school ,  without spilling a drop . 
they work great with business slacks ,  no slippage ,  and easy to grab and go . 
buy the big num_num pound bag of popcorn  also on amazon  it is the perfect combination . 
i have never been a big microwaving fan ,  feeling that it destroys the flavor of food . 
i moved from one area to another and found the water to taste like old rusty pipes . 
this product is easy to read and easy to use and good quality . 
gotta turn the brightness up a little more but it does its job . 
roast but this knife has an edge that almost glides through the roast with ease . 
i can power on the plantronics and it fires up and answers the call immediately . 
i have a van that can use the clips on the vent ,  i am glad i found this . 
unlike the sony ,  i can change the volume on the phone and the headset adapter independently . 
i make most everything from scratch and these are great for making your own english muffins . 
this item has been sooo darn helpful for my silly droid num_num which is seemingly always low on power . 
similarly ,  the camera lens on the back of the phone doesn t touch the surface when laid flat . 
it retains heat much better than glass type . 
i picked this up ,  like other reviewers ,  at another location at a very affordable price . 
took about num_extend weeks to receive this item . 
i had an older model with only one slot for years and i got this one . 
i thought it was going to be more rubberized but it s ok . 
i have not tried soft boiled eggs yet . 
these boards also comes in num_num thicknesses :  num_extend and num_extend thick . 
samsung unfortunately ,  decided to make the redial function activate with a single touch to the button . 
the suction feet really keep this in place . 
will purchase from seller again i received on time and the packaging was to protect . 
i d easily recommend this product at $ or so ,  but $ is a bit high in my opinion . 
the pan survived its trip through the dishwasher relatively intact ,  although the external aluminum surface was dulled . 
it is thin ,  flexible and wide enough for anything . 
my wire and i have become popcorn freaks . 
it sucks so hard it pulls the carpet up a bit .  . and talk about pet hair . 
this one is a great product that is priced well . 
the device although a bit bulky to wear if you re wearing thinner clothing ,  works as promised . 
the pack arrives partly charged ,  and charged fully in a couple of hours . 
less mess and it doesn t change the consistency of your frosting ! all in all ,  great set for beginners  like me  !  . 
i ordered this sim card as a replacement for my grandbaby s lost phone . 
comes with every connecter you could possibly need . 
love fiesta bowls ,  so the product gets a num_num rating . 
they are nice and heavy ,  but not too heavy . 
i have recommend the thermometer to many friends . 
i wonder why i stayed with plastic boxes so long . 
it s subtle but striking . fit a :  it snapped right onto my iphone num_extend with a nice ,  snug ,  secure fit . 
i bought together with a fit folio case and you cant even tell is there . 
it has kept my phone pretty safe but it is made of thick rubbery plastic material . 
look ,  i m not here to tell you what to do . 
the tip does bend ,  but it s not a huge deal if it s not completely straight . 
in any event ,  whatever it s made of ,  it feels quite strong to the touch . 
this oem quality product work great and fits very snug . 
i love the look of these glasses ,  but they are big and heavy for women and kids . 
once connected ,  the atrix takes over your car  minus auto pilot  . 
light crackling on occasion when num_extend is active in the area ,  but not terribly noticeable . 
i am used to sanding down the connector for the right fit . 
i recently ordered this set and am very pleased with it . 
if you need to replace your wifi antenna and are missing screws ,  order this !  worked perfect . 
otherwise ,  i don t think i could have a productive kitchen without it . 
the salton is a simple ,  inexpensive gadget ,  easy to store and clean . 
i got this one because it looked sturdier . 
it can be fairly easily bent ,  so it s not really appropriate for heavy duty commercial use . 
this unit has a removable basket that can be easily rinsed out . 
this helps cause the minerals to clump together and settle . 
i used it for the first time last night . 
this makes excellent pizza and the cutter is the best i have used . 
i personally find my pressure cooker an essential piece of kitchen equipment . 
i ordered two more recently as gifts and my friends also love it . 
the skimmer works really well and i use it frequently . 
luckly i use it to fill my water filter ,  and the white stuff floated on top . 
sure it ll be great ,  but then you re wasting a ton of this siphons potential and that s just sad . 
this mirror was just as described even though my daughter did not like it is still just as described . 
the only problem i had with this one that it came without the adhesive band to install it . 
now use it for just browning at times . 
thanks steve ,  but i can really take it from here . 
it has a cord so it have be hung around your neck or on a hook ,  door knob ,  etc . 
once you get over the shock of how to install ,  they re really no problem !  . 
i ve washed them on extra long washes and they still don t warp . 
i thought i had ordered the num_num cup but ended up with the num_extend and i m pleased anyway . 
since they aren t nonstick ,  i had to spray them with pam before use . 
it took seven minutes to compete brewing six cups of coffee . 
it is a refurb ,  but that is their condition ,  and it looks and works perfectly . 
once applied you won t realize it s even there . 
i was actually hesitant to buy from lodge based on the price being so low . 
it works wonderfully and is very well made . 
the cover showed up on time and was very easy to install on my phone . 
all in all ,  it has kept my atrix in excellent condition . 
this along with the egg sandwich maker are great ways to speed up breakfast  or even dinner  making . 
i think i will buya pair of child size tube socks and make my own  collar  . 
i expect it to last a very long time . 
i had no idea that a simple product like this would make such a difference . 
i think the fan looks pretty good too . 
if it has a downside ,  it is that it is rather large . 
this product does the job and is fairly priced . 
everyone asks where i got this because it s so solid and nice . 
the grill pan makes cooking healthier but i like it the least because cleaning is a pain . 
all knives at this level are top quality ,  please base your decision on preference and try them out first . 
seems to be cast as one piece ,  is reasonably stout and easy to clean . 
there is no need to be in the same room to feel the benefit . 
i should have gotten several and very well may . 
this is a really good protective case that protect the entire ipad . 
it is a nice little store filled with helpful people and unique items . 
this dough ball creates a cookie between num_num and num_extend inches in diameter ,  the perfect size for us . 
i can give this the necessary stirring whilst preparing other food or doing dishes . 
my son still enjoys playing angry birds on it . 
this is just what we needed for our kitchen . 
great handling and very nice looking on my kitchen counter . 
pair it up with your device  which was also straight forward  ,  and you re set . 
so found this to be easy to cut our pan pizza s ,  bar cookies . 
my grinder is still going strong after daily use for ten years !  if it broke ,  i d buy another krups . 
you can see and feel the seam on it . 
high temp was num_num degrees when fully warmed . cooking room temperature num_num lb . 
it fits nicely into the round of the pot where the side merges into the floor . 
children love to use this and it is certainly safer than a knife for young ones . 
i just made some banana bread in the silicone rubber loaf pan . 
i love my grinder and have used it daily since its purchase for my morning coffee . 
this have been one of my most fav phone i ever had . 
this cleans miles of carpet and leaves it soft and smelling really fresh . 
after the processing time and the pressure had dropped the regulator was removed and then later the jars . 
i don t drink diet soda anymore ,  and i don t waste old ,  cold coffee or tea . 
the storm has been done since num_num but this charger has not . 
i m tired of unequal cookies that results in uneven baking . 
i bought two of these dispensers ,  one for dish soap and one for hand soap . 
as for me ,  i use each phone equally . 
i prefer to use this for most tasks . 
cookies are all the same size and relatively uniform shape when using this . 
i wash mine and let them air dry . 
it works on my kindle fire ,  but not on my droid razr . 
the machine worked as the directions said and it was much quieter than i expected . 
i was so happy to be able to find this battery . 
i wanted something that would be out of the way . 
in fact ,  i have just purchased a skillet in the same line . 
i knew this was not a genuine apple cable when i ordered it . 
i was able to play music on my iphone for about num_num hours using this . 
no matter how long i used my tablet the num_extend just didn t drain very much . 
set up is easy and he quality of the speaker is clear . 
since the word sharp is subjective first then let me clarify what the term sharp means to me . 
much better than the wooden ones .  .  . sturdy and does not leave yellow marks from the wood discoloring on the clothing . 
wash after wash ,  the dishwasher has not tarnished its finish . 
that is why i am only giving it num_num stars . 
like the case ,  however the paint scratches off the thin metal of the case . 
we love our fiesta ware because it is one of the few products out there that has no lead . 
it s kind of a  puffy tip  almost like soft foam underneath the domed cover which covers the hard tip . 
she said it heats up very quickly and it is convenient to clean . 
in some ways i believe the android os is clearly superior and in some ways the iphone is . 
and you can maintain it to keep it sharp . the handle is comfortable . 
then num_num days after ,  i was noticed that the old unit was received by the company unu . 
great color ,  my husband loves it so far . 
good price to go along with that and and my wife is very happy . 
i never imagined such a difference was possible . 
the stand makes it possible to see the time and email etc . while also charging . 
i needed to replace a plastic scoop and purchased this one . 
i can make it through a pound of cheese very quickly ,  producing uniform slices . 
i wanted to make them on the top of the stove with the internet recipe . 
this takes some time to get used num_extend
it held my samsung galaxy note num_num with ionic guardian case firmly in place . 
i just spend more time in the kitchen than i am interested in doing . 
my wife wanted one of these for christmas .  .  .  . really she did .  .  .  .  . i m not kidding . 
i didn t have any of the quality control issues that one reviewer had with the battery terminals . 
however ,  these might be slightly better as well as slightly heavier . 
the suction cup works well ,  though like all but the best ,  takes a couple tries . 
but other then that the cocomotion is great . i have warmed other concoctions like hot apple cider ,  capuccino . 
my sister got this for a gift for my gf and i when we moved in together . 
i love it !  i used it the day i got it in the mail and was happy with it . 
you ll look for things to shrink wrap . but ,  in the kitchen ,  this is a must have . 
i have a motorola num_extend earpiece and wanted to make sure that i would not lose or misplace it . 
the corners fall long at the legs and leave a shorter drop where you sit . 
it also helped my friends recover from hangovers a lot quicker . 
once you have fresh orange juice ,  you realize how all the store bought is just watered down sugar . 
with normal usage ,  my phone won t make it through the day . 
it can warm up left overs like new . 
i wouldn t want to leave a stylus unprotected banging around in a purse . 
they went with the black ,  white and red theme of her party . 
now i know to wait at least num_num minutes ,  just like most bakers recommend . 
stacking ,  folding ,  and perfect for cooling almost anything . 
i broke my phone a few months back and have procrastinated replacing it . 
i expect this pan to last a long time . 
i had the large george foreman grill for quite a while . 
i use it to make my  cappuccino  . the machine is well built and has never leaked . 
it was a real disappointment from the start . 
i had actually expected the metal to be thinner and was pleased to find they are nice and sturdy . 
you need to have a specific apple cord to charge on it . 
again ,  spent ages trying to get it all to work . 
submerge it in water for a few minutes before installing it in the pitcher for the first time . 
it s the same as the one that came with the droid . 
my coffee stays hot all day ,  and i ve never had a problem with leaks . 
the cord has a velcro strip to wrap in place when not in use ,  very handy !  . 
flat out ,  you can t protect an iphone any better then in a defender series . 
i couldn t ask for better at this price point . 
one morning i filled this airpot with fresh coffee at home and drove out to my construction job site . 
this durable protective case works great for my phone . 
i chose this thermometer because it it is inexpensive and it is waterproof  makes it easy to clean  . 
a num_num cup kitchen aid has a num_num watt motor ,  the num_num cup cuisinart has a num_extend motor . 
was so cheap and i think it lasted longer than my original battery . 
if you put it in this special vacuum device you can use it to vacuum seal stuff . 
so far have canned number of fruits ,  beans and peas . 
it will take up to fifteen minutes for the put to finish a brewing cycle . 
unless you are a family of more than num_num people ,  this is definately big enough . 
it does well in the car and has good range . 
even in the florida sun ,  works great and doesn t fall like other models . 
this product is everything that you d expect from kitchenaid . 
exactly what a laundry bag should be .  .  . able to perform a heavy duty !  . 
she absolutely loved this gift ,  particularly the size and quality . 
i have this rack hanging in our kitchen holding our le creuset and lodge enameled cast iron . 
we happen to have a num_num so we used it for that . 
just fill with milk to the line and poke the button . 
won t dull your knife and since it comes with num_extend i suspect these will last a while before replacing . 
may be good to buy an extra one for parties . 
just because it s a blender doesn t mean it can t be num_extend easy to assemble and disassemble . 
pineapple slices cooked in this pan have a great flavor . 
they don t scratch easily and install rather quickly ,  once you ve gotten used to applying them . 
you get what you pay for ,  and this pan is a quality item . 
i wanted to make my black epic ,  which was constantly hiding in my purse ,  more visible . 
the motor section should be fairly difficult to get dirty ,  but is easy to just wipe clean . 
i am getting another to store linens ,  pillows ,  etc . 
shut it off when the popping sounds became less frequent at a little over three minutes . 
also most of them had plastic in one way or another ,  so that ruled them out . 
we ll use it for now but i ll get her the defender for valentines day  besides of the white roses  . 
buy it it can t be beat for turning eggs . 
i agree ! we leave this out on the stove as it s rather large . 
it is easier to twist while i am trying to pipe macarons . 
this new operating system manages the power much more efficiently and you will no longer need an  app killer  . 
the app that goes along with it is nice too . 
so this will be my chance to use it as a spice grinder to . 
he uses it all the time when waiting for a plane or when he forgets his adapter . 
travel a lot and this keeps me charged up and talking no matter where i am . 
this one should last me a very long time . 
i would definitely buy another one when this one gets too scratched . 
i would say you could comfortably make a meal for three people . 
it s great for sleeping and it moves air pretty well . 
for the most part this apple corer worked great while it lasted . 
but really ,  there is nothing to improve ,  it s just a great ,  powerful coffee grinder . 
it works for pie crusts ,  ravioli ,  short bread cookies ,  graham crackers ,  etc . 
i gave some to the dog and she was pretty happy . 
heavy base makes them really stabile and they look good and have a nice feel in my hand . 
i just spead them apart and use clips from each one . 
there are many customization options to suit the device to your needs . 
great for the busy cook needing frig to counter to table storage . 
its also a very awkward installation to basically hook the back of this rack onto partially screwed in screws . 
apply a very small amount of soap and your in buisness . 
we ve had this set for twenty years this fall . 
once you try all clad you will be hooked too !  highly recommended !  a+ !  . 
it was nice to work with and came out nicely from the mold ,  holding the shape . 
no live wallpaper . after using these batteries for a few days ,  i decided to try the stock one again . 
it is a very handy size and has been a joy to work on . 
i have had it for many months now and i use it all the time . 
we put some baskets on top to hold coffee and other items . 
that can occasionally be inconvenient and some family members tired of the odor . 
it looks great . i love that it opens from the front so i can put my toaster on top . 
this product is getting great reviews for good reason . 
i actually keep it in a canister on my counter because i use it so much . 
the food processor works great mostly; has a couple things i don t like about it . 
the reason i purchased this was to cover the food at our luau . 
unfortunately  ?   ,  i bought this apron as a present . 
i bought this and used it regularly when driving to obey ca laws . 
i had been looking a long time for a pretty case and finally found it . 
you re only supposed to add water  not wash it out  in between cleanings . 
i can fit this in one of my drawers where it stays until i need them . 
borosilicate glass is a type of glass that includes at least % boric oxide . 
i dropped my phone on several occasions and the phone was completely protected . 
although it was always with me ,  my finger was not accurate enough to make using my kindle a pleasure . 
it s also pretty to look at even empty . 
i bought this set to add to the pyrex bowls i bought open stock at a discount store . 
if you can get use to it ,  it s actually the best bt headset i ve ever used . 
further ,  the headset alerts you when you walk too far away from the smartphone . 
if it ever dies i ll certainly buy another one . 
this has made making apple dishes so much quicker . 
because i can say with absolute certainty that this charger will work with non motorola branded batteries . 
this sponge holder clings to the side of my sink and holds a sponge . 
buy a screen protector kit so you don t have to do this again . 
the cutout at the bottom is big enough for even the bulkiest of dock connectors . 
i love this bird s beak and use it more than i had imagined i would . 
however ,  this is probably my most used piece of the set ,  and i really have no complaints of it . 
there is always a compromise between protective capacity  weight and bulkiness  and slim and sleekness . 
it arrived in just a few days and works great . this fan is a real air mover . 
i put my nice peeler in the bottom square hole and my sharpener in the upper left one . 
th e oatmeal is out of this world . 
this is my fourth plantronics headset ,  not because it breaks but because i keep losing it . 
the base is thicker than most pans and the pans feel very sturdy . 
my kitchen is on the small side with low ceilings . 
i ve owned many pizza pans over the years ,  aluminum ,  nonstick ,  airbake ,  pizza stone ,  you name it . 
saw it used at a friends house and had to have it . 
i thought it wasn t going to fit it . 
the whole point of this vacuum is it s excellent hepa filtration . 
all of these are wonderful ,  so i m coming back for more !  . 
this oxo peeler is not like the others . 
you need to use the right format for video ,  num_extend seems to work the best . 
but when it arrived ,  i wanted to try it out . 
i loaded heavy cream into my food processor to make whipped creams for desserts . 
as for appearance it looks very nice and most of she likes it . 
one great way to add more fat and calories to an otherwise healthy diet . 
you do not know what you are missing to have fresh baked hamburger buns  ,  breakfast loafs ,  etc . 
imho you get a great product for the price . 
i tried to give it num_num stars ,  but amazon would only let me do num_extend
i see complaints about it burning rice but ours doesn t . 
i use these on my phone and my wifes . 
all i can attest to is that the teeth with my blender are also plastic but are still there . 
it adds the rubbery protection that absorbs impact and the outer shell is not slippery at all . 
there are so many colors ,  shapes and sizes . 
i was tired of buying the packaged microwave popcorns as most were too salty or too buttery . 
my old machine was larger ,  louder ,  and a bit less powerful . 
however ,  i found the following shortcomings with this num_extend
i bought a bunch of individual oxo steel utensils and love them all . 
however ,  it s not possible to get it entirely clean after use . 
it is sturdy ,  stays put and allows me to see and use my phone easily . 
i just used my pin for the first time to roll out my sugar cookies . 
i put this case on my the num_extend of my boss . 
when i cut carrots ,  the carrots stain the slicer orange . 
i just received this item a few weeks ago and have only used it a few times . 
it is an actual data transfer cable and works perfectly for my lg tracfone . 
bought at target so i can take it back locally . 
now don t be hasty to judge me ,  i did read what size it was . 
i first reviewed this num_num years ago ,  and gave it num_num stars . 
but i found the nesco dehydrator took a lot longer to dry fruit than i expected . 
i wish it was a little softer though . 
i enjoy cooking more when i m using quality utensils . 
works comparable to an oem battery with no issues at all . 
it fit ok without the gel cover on the phone but with the gel cover it was useless . 
it does the job and i m glad i bought it . 
it s not painful ,  just annoying to me ,  but your mileage may vary . 
this was a life saver for her and made her job so much easier . 
i m guessing all the development costs went into noise cancellation and styling . 
best protection you can t get !  it s my second case . 
if you make your own pizzas at home like i do this gadget is the best thing to have . 
nice looking and good product for a $ price . 
i have a total of num_extend for the price . 
i also cooked fresh tuna once and it was delicious . 
i bought three sets from amazon and had them shipped to costa rica . 
it worked great on the apple ipod touch num_extend and num_extend as well as on the kindle fire num_extend
given that i wasn t going to use it for extreme sports ,  i launched for the purchse . 
i m a tea lover ,  and i m thrilled with the hamilton beach iced tea maker . 
i think it is a wonderful buy for the price . 
one for myself and one for my wife s family . 
i use them while cutting the lawn with a push mower ,  and at full volume ,  they are adequate . 
and no more reaching in with one oven mitt and pulling out the pan . 
they are very sturdy and have held up well so far . 
now with the infinity burr grinder i now use less coffee than my old blade grinder . 
the holster works well enough even though it is cheap plastic and it does swivel . 
thank goodness the box it came in had icons photos of how to do it . 
always use distilled water and plan a white vinagar soak at least once a year depending on use . 
my oxo purchases have all been great replacements for all my antiquated kitchen tools . 
the caveat with lemons is that the huge ones are too big . 
its bulky but its great for a woman who keeps her phone in the purse . 
i think the popper is our favorite piece . 
another horror story is the noise most of these machines make ,  not the panasonic . 
four children under age six tend to make a lot of crumbs . 
only minor complaint is that they pick of some background noise when using them for calls . 
one set i have used for crafts ,  and it has gotten a little stained due to all the glue . 
no problems and i only use up one outlet . can t beat it for the price . 
this does the job well  room is now even  and doesn t make to much noise on low . 
the pies just come out beautifully ,  no burning ,  etc . 
realistically you shouldn t clean granite with anything other than water . 
when the price dropped recently ,  i bought one ,  and it has lived up to the magazine s reviews . 
i put the phone in the cradle and can use the phone via bluetooth . 
he adds the oats and water and sets up the timer overnight . 
this is a good quality steamer with simple easy to use buttons . 
they also feel very heavy in my stomach . 
after all this machine cooks by using blowing hot air . 
i thought the second pair was just fine until my shun shears arrived . 
i got this same pan for $ during a sale . 
the little hole on the top ensures your tub won t overflow . 
i had cooked over num_num pounds dry . i really love this steamer and will buy another . 
i can use it on my computer with skype or google talk . 
love that they aren t easy to tip over . 
they were packaged neatly and if you follow the instructions for application ,  you have a nice spotless screen saver . 
it looks much better and is not bulky . 
i was standing num_num feet away and could feel the breeze it was creating . 
otter box does give a single screen protector if you buy this case . 
the fact that boiled and poached eggs don t incorporate extra fat in the cooking process is also a bonus . 
yup ,  it is exactly the same size as a sony psp although with much higher resolution . 
the iphone num_num was my maiden voyage into the world of touchscreen phones . 
i would not hesitate to recommend this product to a friend . 
i shop at whole foods ,  but i would never ,  ever by oxo products there as one reviewer mentioned . 
peanut oil is my favorite ,  and smells great when heated . 
he would never go back to the glass carafe type coffeemaker . 
then we stumbled across the olde thompson set and found a very reasonable price and lots of good reviews . 
it also sounded like i was talking from the bottom of a water well . 
my favorite feature was the  top brown only  option on the toast . 
leaving the power cord in the power will result in a much shorter lifespan and burnout . 
but when i make big batches it s not enough ,  so i will probably be ordering another one . 
it didnt take long to recieve and it protects my phone perfectly . 
works great ,  if it gets a little clogged ,  just add warm water to the base . 
it doesn t cost much but did a fantastic job on my rugs . 
with all of the size options there is no problem getting the right sized circle i need . 
this is an excellent set for a busy family such as mine . 
take it a part ,  rinse the pieces and pop into the diswasher on the top rack . 
the edge on this knife is bad to the bone ,  for raw meat as well as veggies . 
as expected ,  they did not steer me wrong . 
i keep cereal in them and keep them on my counter . 
i have fried boneless ,  skinless thighs to perfection . 
i also unscrewed my overflow plate and turned it upside down which helped add water as well . 
i ordered this tool not knowing how handy it would come in . 
however ,  i feel like every other day or so i have to make sure it s tighten securely . 
the unlikely case manufacture ,  amazon ,  has now released the perfect case for your older iphone . 
the handle does not appear dense enough to hold the screws under tension ,  so they lose their bite . 
i was delighted with the yogurt maker that i purchased . 
anything other then sitting and the fall out within a couple seconds to a couple minutes . 
these things are a must have in my household and it works perfectly for us . 
you get num_num hangers in a package ,  they are sturdy ,  versatile ,  and simply get the job done . 
this is a great little coffee maker for num_num people . 
the filter effectively keeps the grounds out of the coffee to be consumed . 
they definitely don t think of seniors when putting items in strong packages . 
my sister has dropped her a few times and it still protects it like a charm . 
i had nothing else suitable for making hollandaise sauce . 
my wife and i received a smaller ,  cheaper preasure cooker as a wedding gift . 
if you brew more than one pod a day ,  you need this tank . 
my wife is very satisfied with this purchase . 
the shape of the bowls work much better for me than pyrex . 
i have had mine for several years and love it . 
overall ,  it protects the screen and when placed properly looks good . 
the best cup of coffee is brewed from freshly roasted coffee in a burr grinder . 
but over all until the mold shock we found this delightful though only used occasionally . 
i added in a num_extend micro sdhc card ,  and it instantly recognized it . 
i have a supersized oven in my range and it took forever to preheat the oven . 
you don t buy this type of case and wine because it wont fit your dock . 
dribbles a little at spout if not careful . 
this is a very nice set of mini ladles . 
it s too small to do much with ,  but i think it s great for making one egg . 
but if it breaks in num_num months ,  i ll just buy a new one . 
the little round glass with m logo on it lights up blue when you plug it in . 
it is well worth the money spent on this grill . 
im not complaining tho cuz it cost very little recommend  :   . 
the headphones pair quickly and block out external noise very well . 
these knives are made for a lifetime of use . 
the glass door is very attractive with shelves inside . 
it even works with my screen protector on . 
the assortment of knives will cover any situation . 
i wanted a deep dish tart pan that would hold up . 
the motorola num_extend has a weird deal with fitting into my ear canal and basically doesn t . 
i used it on potatoes and it worked great . 
they install easy and the hooks are adjustable so you can hang different size items . 
i love that there are no sharp edges on my lids . 
this case comes complete with its own screen protector built in ,  too . 
it is smooth once you add the protector . 
the feel is nice and it s not bulky at all . 
they haven t been used yet ,  so no word on that . 
great product to have in the kitchen for cooking . 
i m going to see if there is the same style in a num_num qt . 
don t force the portafilter arm on as far as it will go . 
for a solid year i searched the market for a set of measuring spoons made in the usa . 
i would not pay the standard price of near $
while traveling i stayed at an extended stay hotel that had a pot like this one . 
when you squeeze it the press turns the peel inside out and you get the maximum yield of juice . 
being made of tempered glass ,  the bowls can be used in the microwave ,  oven ,  fridge and freezer . 
i have had a my kitchenaid for num_num years now . 
the whole chickens are far superior to even the most conscientiously roasted poultry . 
i love the fact that the smaller glasses still hold quite a bit . 
it is not quiet . however ,  it is a workhorse and it gets the job done . 
i ve had these pyrex storage containers for about num_num months . 
a very good and reliable battery to use . 
i like the length ,  the feel and the weight . 
not the smallest or cutest bluetooth ,  but certainly the most reliable in my experience . 
after using mine and liking it so much ,  i just ordered a second for the wife s pre . 
the sound system i have had a single rca plug at the end to plug into the speaker . 
i use this lighted dual plug in my truck all the time . 
these measuring cups go great with my stainless steel oxo measuring spoons . 
so glad to have this funnel for putting foods into jars . 
the only downside is that it takes a lot of fruit to make a little juice . 
there are a lot of things it will do for you without you even realizing it . 
that headset was put back in the box immediately . this headset ?  it s amazing . 
if you like your milk or flavored creamer really frothy just try using a smaller amount . 
i highly recommend getting one of these to add to your kitchen tool arsenal . 
i was looking for something that did small shredding and slicing jobs and this product was perfect . 
this allows me to keep all my scarves together while displaying them neatly . 
it keeps the wine chilled while sitting out . 
it s heavy and well made with rolled edges . 
i don t like to eat my coffee ,  but i like it full rounded ,  and clean tasting . 
this is a nice neutral linen pattern that will go with any china . 
a product like a replacement filter doesn t really have much to review about . 
this is very sturdy and the legs can be adjusted for uneven areas . 
need to use wax paper for both sides ,  otherwise the dough will stick to the flat num_extend
it s small ,  so if you are chopping anything of notable size ,  you ll have to run a few rounds . 
it fits on my phone even though i use different cases with my phone . 
since having bluetooth in the car ,  i stopped using a headset regularly .  .  . until i got the era . 
so as long as your mixture s consistency is not too thin these should not leak . 
i rarely take the suction cup off ,  even when i m not using the camera . 
i have owned this coffee maker for over num_num years now and it s performed beautifully without a hitch . 
the wire is not strong enough to cut really hard cheeses like parmesean; no wire type slicer is . 
it s smaller than i thought ,  even having reviewed the dimensions before purchasing . 
check the weight ,  the pan itself is nearly three pounds ,  a lot for such a smallish pan . 
luckily i purchased a different kind for the galaxy note num_extend
worth paying the extra money over cheaper products that may last a month or two . 
easy to set up ,  the sound is perfect and the battery life is great . 
the keyboard is basically the same as the old torch . 
the aesthetics are not especially compelling ,  but i like the bowls just fine . 
i would have the phone and the headset . i love the size of this phone . 
other than that good stylus at a cheap price . 
we do not cook meats ,  it is grilling indoors after all ,  and can make quite a mess . 
very happy with my purchase and i would definitely consider purchasing more of these jars . 
and i love the phone even more with this razor thin case . 
i ve used it several times and have been very happy with it . 
there is plenty of storage room on these for all your needs . 
simply rinse out the sludge once a week and all is fine . 
a credit card was used to smooth out the bubbles . 
i am happy with it and would buy it again . 
the spring lever has a fairly stiff action but i don t mind . 
however it does take a lot longer to charge it than my original phone one . 
it is very easy to install ,  just remember to read the instructions . 
sturdier than the normal tools so it should last longer . 
she is often dropping her phone or ipod on the ground and this case keeps it completely safe . 
i followed the instructions and it installed very easily . 
it is solid ,  good handles ,  a joy to cook with . 
sunbeam num_num adjustable can opener with knife sharpener ,  whitethought this would be easy to use . 
my italian grandmother used a grater just like this when i was a girl . 
works exactly as expected and i m very happy with the purchase . 
this is all metal and should last a lot longer . 
also ,  a much smaller grinding burr that ran at a very high ,  noisy speed . 
this is truly a wonderful and handy ironing board . 
the build quality is awesome and the fit is flawless and really protects the phone and looks greats . 
i have never had a screen protector on my phones before . 
been making a lot of bread lately and my plastic scrapers weren t doing that good a job . 
they are made of aluminum with rolled over edges . 
also ,  only inconsiderate people would use this machine while others are sleeping; it s pretty loud ,  especially at first . 
but that actually set my expectation very high . 
the newer upgrades were mostly software things i am not using . 
just like granny used !  nothing else compares to cast iron .  .  . it just does nt . 
i only wish i had purchased one for myself as at the time the pricing was fabulous . 
my battery life had become horrible on my galaxy s ii . 
the oxo good grips large wooden slotted spoon is a newcomer ,  replacing a silicone one that actually wore out . 
this really helped keep the screen protected from scratches . 
i bought this case for my iphone num_num when i bought it about a year and a half ago . 
these knives are all i need to prepare almost any dish . 
so i think this purchase rates more than num_num stars . 
i have had my kitchenaid for around num_num years now ,  maybe longer . 
it s a little confusing to set up but once you get the hang of it ,  it s great . 
i like the multiple earpiece options and found it to be very comfortable . 
 knock on wood   it would be the greatest case ever . 
i bought it for english muffins which need a lid . 
what fun ! this particular unit is the first i ve ever purchased . 
its claim of keeping wines fresh to up to num_num weeks is grossly exaggerated ,  even under ideal situations . 
everyone loved it ,  and it was so easy to use . 
it s really nice to get a consistent thickness so that it steams evenly . 
i believe that most tools in my kitchen  including knives  must have more than one function . 
this is perfect when it is snowing out or too too cold to use barbeque . 
so what i m saying is the seller oem planet has the best touch screen pens . 
you never know when a belt will break . 
she recommends this thermos to anyone who wants a good cup of tea to last for hours . 
but it does the job at a cheap price . 
i highly recommended this case for total protection of your phone . 
all those who gave this case anything above num_num stars is misleading you . 
cutting leather ,  ropes ,  shoe ,  and a few other items  using my knives to compare against cutco knives . 
just add the right amount of water and the eggs and you ll get them perfectly cooked each time . 
at least while new ,  it s quite stiff and can be a pain to close . 
my daughter also remarked how easy it is to use . 
it will pull off like fruit leather ,  and you can cut them up into triangles . 
case is sturdy and he likes how protective it is . 
you will need to spend num_num mins with instructions to learn how certain features work ,  but worth it . 
luckily ,  i have . this one makes one thick belgian waffle ,  about num_extend square ,  which can be split into quarters . 
i will continue to buy droid phones for as long as i have cellphones . 
really does a super job of juicing ! can t beat the price for the work it does . also ,  easy to clean !  . 
so far works well with iphone earbud ,  beats studio ,  and my audio technica . 
for the price ,  however ,  this is fine and everyone seems to enjoy the sticks . 
as other reviewers have stated ,  they were not packaged very well ,  but fortunately mine all arrived without any breakage . 
first off ,  i m an absolute idiot in the kitchen . 
so if you are looking for a product fulfilling that purpose ,  then move on ,  they re not for you . 
i tried using it in hot soup once and it started whining after that . 
these glasses are very heavy ,  but easy to hold and perfect for thirsty people . 
i have wanted one of these forever and never got around to purchasing one . 
they all look great ,  but this purple is just gorgeous on the table . 
i really like this product so far and it looks well made . 
my cat chewed through my charger and needed to replace it . 
my sprout grower needed cheese cloth to be able to hold the smaller sprout seeds . 
right now i have zero freezer space so the only option was canning . 
the main reason i bought this case is the two ways to attach to a belt . 
the problem was that this model was unavailable ,  removed from manufacture for some unfathomable reason . 
the only thing i have left to do is to deepfry . 
i can use this for grilled sandwiches as well . 
works great for everything ,  but a little tricky for some paperbacks because they slip around a little bit . 
it has a sleek design which looks great on my galaxy iiis . 
this sort of opener is needed infrequently in my home . 
unrelated to the clip ,  my phone has take a couple of dives on concrete and has come out unscathed . 
these bowls are great for mixing ,  serving and chilling . 
make sure to place the filter in a glass of water while cleaning . 
i really like this and would recommend it !  . 
num_extend hd screen ,  gorilla glass keeps the screen from breaking and scratching ,  easy to use . 
this is only a hobby so i don t make cakes everyday . 
the connection is fast with no hiccups so far . 
specifically ,  get this very practical ,  and easily affordable grinder . 
no burned spots because this diffuses the heat very nicely . 
simply plug it in and wait for the running light to go off . 
sprint levies a $ surcharge on monthly usage fees for the evo . 
the screen protector is great ,  i mean it s probably the best out there . 
i bought this because i wanted a car dock that was specific to the droid x . 
it does work and emits a pleasant clean rain smell . 
this is no exception ,  works nicely for making thin slices on hard or semisoft cheeses . 
even better ,  a lot more slimmer in design . 
i had a need for several of these cnargers . 
i took off one star for the length of the cord . 
i plan on ordering a few sets as gifts . 
keep it clean and perhaps replace the gasket every year or so ,  and it should last forever . 
it only has one temperature setting but i don t need it really specific . 
this thermos was a bit bigger than i thought it would be ,  but that s my mistake . 
left to right and top to bottom and you re done . 
cable construction actually seems to feel sturdier than the apple cable  the rubber seems a little thicker anyway  . 
make sure to check the size of your filter so that you get the right size . 
the earlier model wasn t even close to being this versatile . 
this thing protected my phone like no other . 
great bag clips but stiff to open and close . 
my only complaint is that thick infinity scarves will not fit through the provided holes . 
they are a bit of an odd size ,  for me anyway . 
it does get hot so hold it my the top when you take it out of the microwave . 
this happens regardless of the quality of your source audio file . 
just be nice to it and don t use a sharp knife to cut the cake . 
it doesn t reach from my outlet to the stove top . 
i m so glad these are available on amazon ,  since they are difficult to find locally . 
i bought this case for my daughter based on the sparkle design and she was happy with it . 
you can control the speed at which you re cutting stuff in the processor . 
adjustment is simple ,  both for grind size and desired quantity . 
my last machine seemed to take an extraordinary length of time to drip . 
i was really surprised when i received them quickly . 
this was purchased some time ago and continues to be one of the most used appliances in my kitchen . 
this lg headset has ,  at the least ,  comparable sound quality and is well constructed . 
this is by far one of the most functional and beautiful items in my kitchen . 
back to the oven it went for num_num hours to be seasoned . 
i like how it lights up too and that ring makes it easy to pull out . 
this rack does the job and cleans easily . 
i like it small ,  perfect for my small apartment . 
i hate when people use headsets that make them sound far away or like they re standing in a silo . 
i purchased this set about six weeks ago am very pleased with it to date . 
the shape ,  size ,  and strainer on this separator are terrific . 
yes some of the kernels get blown out of the spout however that happens in most hot air poppers . 
you have to actually open the urn to look . 
which is ,  at least ,  inefficient . it s annoying that the tool for getting under furniture does not fit onto the machine . 
it s very easy to operate and doesn t need much cleaning . 
it s a pain to lift the top and scrape with the mixer off . 
the dough blade has proven perfect for making bread dough in my food processor . 
oh  ,  yes ,  don t forget the roast ,  beef or pork ,  comes out fork tender each and every time . 
these are great and easily go across where the poles join . 
it s just the best for cooking ,  easy to clean ,  and the handles never break . 
the release latch for the angle of the handle is pretty not good . 
looks like i didn t need to worry ! my waffle iron has been getting regular use now for about num_num years . 
i run each test on each port twice once with a generic cable and once with supplied cable . 
a great peeler that is easy to hold . 
i fell in love with it s classy red color and how good it feels in the hand . 
don t drive yourself crazy crippling the incredible s functions by killing apps and wifi and sync and gps . 
turns out it was off by more than num_num degrees most of the time . 
i got this to replace one of the collapsible kind . 
love the color and it works for tall cans be just a sensitive opener . 
this is a great tool and now one of my favorites . 
need a replacement paddle .  .  .  . this one looks oem or better . 
and best of all the price ,  same protection but priced so much lower . 
but with a little modification it will work fine . 
a little disappointed ,  does not show pattern on chocholate cakes very well . 
it is fantastic !  it is solidly constructed and truly stainless steel ,  not something that claims to be . 
i was very happy with my last rubbermaid scraper . 
kept my phone alive way over num_num hour long shifts too . 
not only did it work fine ,  it did not break the bank . 
i have a white iphone num_num and i can t even tell it s there . 
i ve owned this particular brand and style before and was pleased with its performance . 
you don t need something like this often ,  but when it s needed .  .  .  .  .  .  . it is needed and becomes a godsend . 
i used it at extensive length at a car repair shop that sits at a busy intersection one evening . 
but num_num get one free ,  mix and match products . 
great knives at a great price !  i m a huge j . a . 
i like to have extra protection inside my otter box and this is the way to go . 
i have always liked  . corelle; bought this in red for my weekend cabin . 
overall this is a really good product for what i paid . 
pyrex made a good choice putting these pieces together . 
very sturdy ,  nice quality and i love the way they look . 
this thermos can stay hot or cold for hours !  !  !  !  it is the best one i ve ever owned . 
i ve had it over a year and going strong . 
i bought this based on the comparisons done by america s test kitchen . 
we have a teapot at home we make water for french press coffee with . 
it s been num_num years and still working great . 
i have numerous lodge cast iron pots and pans and i swear by them . 
i accidentally crushed in it a drawer ,  so i decided to get another one . 
sending it back seems too much of a pain . 
i also purchased some coconut popping oil and it is wonderfulparagon coconut popcorn popping oil  gallon  . 
if you are looking for a waffle maker ,  this is it !  . 
it s a good buy ,  ill be using it a lot . 
i ve used this pan a lot when making hamburgers ,  pancakes ,  scrambled eggs and sausage ,  sauteeing vegetables ,  ect ect . 
i put in the quantity of beans that i needed . 
leave it in there for longer and it comes to a chunky liquified form . 
thank you for a good product that is worth every penny !  !  !  . 
the jabra supreme headset has a number of very positive features . 
i did a lot of research before making this purchase and i am satisfied . 
so don t buy this machine if you use finely ground coffee . 
i have used this pan num_num times now . 
i don t know a lot about blue tooth technology so i depend on amazon reviews to guide me . 
to my shock ,  they re replacing it under warranty ,  even though it was really my fault . 
these are spillproof ,  the lids fit very tightly . 
still in use and received in good condition and on time . 
this is the exact design just clear in color . 
the big thing about this is that the sound in loud and clear . 
i especially like that the handles on both pot and lid do not get hot . 
is it possible to love a garlic peeler ?  i m here to tell you it is . 
the screen lock feature is great as it is on the side of the phone . 
we like this particular west bend timer ,  and just bought two more so we re never without . 
i am pleased that i bought it ,  and the price was so right . 
or else you return it if it does not work well for you . 
they are talking about num_num oz num_extend ml  cups . 
i really love it !  this product is not poor quality like one reviewer said . 
this is just what i needed for my wilton cake class . 
however ,  the extra deep burner covers black were exceptionally flimsy . 
the oxo good grips does a really good job at drying my fruits and vegetables . 
this one doesn t spin in two directions like my first one ,  but it still works very well . 
i had to bend the whisk from its circular shape into a slightly oval shape . 
so yea ,  good product but not so great support . 
when this one goes bad  it is a battery after all  i ll get another right here . 
you ll have to interpolate and quess . i must have guessed right when i cooked the burgers . 
but then it stays put for a while . 
i use one in my kitchen for dirty rags and washcloths . 
the additional car charger is also of good quality . 
in the winter ,  these things take the chill right out of the bed before you get in . 
wash up nicely ,  and i see no reason to buy expensive ones . 
i don t have a sense this battery is better than the oem original ,  but it seems to be close . 
if you bread your own tenders ,  this is perfect . 
i love these cutting boards because they do not get knife cuts and are easy to clean . 
i answered a call using a wired headset . 
since that one was still working ,  there was not so much of a need to replace it . 
she says ,  that this one is the very best that she has ever used . 
i use corelle ware and was delighted to find these . 
in all that time it has never been a problem . 
the mic pick up my voice quite well even with that small hole away from mouth . 
heats up quickly and the handle is ok without pot holder . 
my only complaing is the volume control takes a little getting used to . 
i own two bose systems that are larger than this but their sound is more what i enjoy . 
if you re looking to use this stone to improve store bought frozen pizza ,  don t waste your money . 
it also helps to have a cake stand that turns . 
a teaspoon of oil and nothing  i mean nothing  will stick . 
you ll be doing everything from opening paint cans to cutting weeds with it . 
i have an incipio rubbery case ,  and it fits with ease . 
the batteries have a much longer life and now i have a fully charged backup  the second battery  . 
the num_extend battery is on par with other windows phone devices . 
i used it . my crackberry is now fixed and the trackback glows green !  i love cheap replacement parts !  . 
it is easier to melt butter in the microwave and pour it over the finished popcorn . 
at first ,  i was skeptic to buy this product ,  this is my first time . 
but it s much better than paying $ for an otterbox . 
and this is for all the bormioli rocco jugs that i have tried is the handle . 
it s a good size that can be used for gravy or dressing . 
it is clear ,  so you can see what you are cooking . 
dishwasher safe is the main thing i look for in a knife ,  the second is sharpness . 
i don t know why anyone still uses drip coffee makers . 
i did extensive research before purchasing a roomba ,  and did purchase it locally  sorry amazon  with an extended warranty . 
it ll crimp the strap a little ,  but if you like it tight ,  you ll need to do this . 
after num_num minutes the tips of my ears can become sore which i am learning to cope with . 
cheaper version tore my homemade bread or crumbled it to bits . 
the droid s voice navigation is everything you could ask for ,  without having to ever buy map updates . 
they seem to be well made and i suspect that they last a long time . 
this one is decent ,  but not drip proof . 
easy to install and slips in and out of her purse easily . 
i love the high sides so the food doesn t slide over the top . 
it takes more counter space than a  regular  toaster oven ,  but it s well worth it . 
volume could be higher but ,  frankly ,  if my hearing were better i probably wouldn t complaining . 
i have used mine to store asparagus with the ends in water to keep it fresh . 
the toaster toasts but not a lot better than the cheapo toaster that we replaced . 
it is nonstick ,  sot it can go it the dishwasher to clean up easily . 
i put a picture in the back ,  making it my own customized case . 
it barely scratched up either !  i love it !  !  !  . 
then ,  i started dinner and proceeded to ignore the roomba for the next hour or so . 
for this mechanism ,  it works as well as any and better than most . 
no callers have said they were not hearing us well . 
buyers should know that it is very heavy ,  if they have never used a stone of this size before . 
but i am aware of amazon return policy . 
the aluminum is a very thick industrial commercial level thickness ,  as is the lid ,  no warping here . 
however ,  because of the price i took my chances with this case . 
i have puree d spinach leaves for spinach pasta  does a great job  . 
this making keeping your blades and disks in a handy place . 
the only downside  and this is true of many grinders  is the plastic lid . 
this is there to dissuade one from over filling . 
i ve read more about pans since the last posting and found that shiny cookware reflects the heat away . 
it does the job better than a space heater and is far cheaper and safer to run . 
i got this as a present for my husband ,  but now i use it all the time for myself . 
it feels like an extension of my hand . 
i ve also used them for holding pasta ,  cereal ,  oats ,  pet food ,  etc . 
it s especially helpful when i have dough stuck to my counter tops . 
but i went ahead and took a chance . 
bought it due to the size ,  in case we have family coming over . 
i like this bowl because ,  it is flatter than most service bowls and fits in my cupboard . 
they stayed on too ,  didn t start peeling at the corners . 
the case is built well as you would expect with a name like ballistic . 
all i need is something to heat up my apartment just a few degrees . 
there are two reasons for choosing stainless steel over plastic . 
i can have my iphone ,  my gps ,  and my radar detector all hooked up with no hassle . 
the only reason i took it off was because i sent the phone back . 
the turquoise is prettier and more vibrant than appears online . 
the buttons work very nicely ,  with a good  click  to them . the included earplugs are very comfortable and sound nice . 
everyone loves it but they won t buy it . 
i decided on fiesta ,  which i have always liked . 
socks and slippers helped but some days even that was insufficient . 
that s how i ended up looking for a handheld . 
the coffee was hot ,  the machine is easy to program ,  clean ,  use . 
seems to be good quality and it works for me . 
those require a finger to be inserted into the spout and upward pressure exerted onto the snug lid . 
never had used a steam cleaner before ,  and hoped it would work miracles on the kitchen grout . 
in addition ,  the sharp spout lets it pour very cleanly . 
they are very tricky to apply to the phone though . 
they are heavy pieces but so worth the lift . 
i own num_num  inherited num_num of them  aluminum presto cookers with the rockers that are going to freecycle . 
it s big enough to cook large amounts of food ,  but not too large to handle . 
it works well with the palm pre touchstone charger . 
call me cautious ,  but money doesn t come easily and i like to take care of my bakeware !   :   . 
i bought this to protect a old iphone num_extend that we don t use as a phone any more . 
it is expensive and somewhat large ,  but i think it is worth it ,  and so does my daughter . 
it is far and away superior to any other way of cooking pizza at home . 
the blender sits on the base very well but not perfect . 
other wavy edge knives we ve had like this one eventually dull and are nearly impossible to resharpen . 
i ve recommended this to all my friends ,  it has had made my life so much easier !  . 
i ve had a lot of pans ,  but they always have problems . 
i bought my spinner from amazon in num_num for not too much less than they cost now . 
no throwing these in a drawer and forgetting about them . 
i keep it on my fridge and it has not fallen off even once . 
fits well if you adjust it according to instructions . 
sturdy ,  easy cleaning ,  glad i made the investment in these oxo scoops . 
moving it around may be a problem for some . 
does what you would expect it to do . 
it fits perfectly in the palm of my hand ,  very comfortable to grip . 
it s well made ,  well designed and doesn t have useless bells and whistles you won t use . 
soak it and it will eventually come off ,  but save the headache and use a liner of some kind . 
the battery arrived as promised ,  the product was intact and it is working as expected . 
i ve found that the only difference between the home and commercial models is power consumption ,  configuration ,  and warranty . 
so i may have to get another one . 
it is possible that they have production problems since alton brown made this more popular and sales picked up . 
it took almost num_num weeks to get to me but did get here . 
it works ! at num_num pounds ,  the presto pro eversharp electric knife sharpener has a sturdy feel and sleek modern look . 
dismissing myself as being silly ,  i continued cooking the meal and served it . 
i use it for pasta ,  bread ,  pie and cooky dough . 
es lo mejor y mas seguro que he encontrado hasta ahora para cargar mi iphone . 
i have had this unit for eleven years . 
these do have the quality of a num_num or num_num dollar set . 
i put mine in the drawer that holds my other lids . 
i love having so many decorating tip options when i bake . 
the battery works great and lasts a very long time . 
cooked egg slips off easily ,  pan is shiny ,  and i am happy . 
this canner worked flawlessly ,  i am now so excited to can again . 
one page recommends olive oil  with vaseline a second choice ; the next page recommends only vaseline . 
if i had to do it over again i d choose this one without thinking twice . 
the battery lasts about num_num hours from what i ve been testing . 
i have a lot of allergies ,  but this machine picks up everything . 
amazon should really change the product description to  color may vary  . 
the pan can also be used without the insert so it is dual purpose . 
best set i have every owned or used . 
after i dry pop ,  i just add my favorite oil like truffle oil ,  olive oil etc . 
these came in bulk packaging but appear to be identical to the retail packaged screens . 
the proctor silex num_extend is the perfect companion to my french press . 
i will use this manufacturer if they make one for the galaxy num_extend
i am not a professional cook ,  just someone who prepares all of our meals from scratch . 
did not go on smooth and could not smooth out most of the bubbles . 
quality of sound from included headphones is excellent . 
my husband has commented that is makes opening cans very easy . 
being used to a balloon whisk i applied more pressure than i should have . 
i needed a place to store the spices that i didn t already have jars for  i . e . 
these are reasonable . speaker wire can be completely hidden . 
they will eventually  cut  and need replacing but ,  for the price ,  no big deal . 
there is a little app including on the phone called musicdj and you can actually make your own ringtones . 
but ,  consider the much cheaper steels . also ,  the german knives are thought to be less hard than the japanese . 
i think glass is healthier and use jars that can be refrigerated or frozen . 
hence the reason i am now shopping around for another slicer . 
before powergen ,  i was limited to charging it from either my car charger or my wall charger . 
i bought this on a reccomendation of a friend . 
i bought it for my daughter and several months later it s still charging just fine . 
i have never had a meal turn out less than perfect . 
make sure to turn off wifi when it s not being used . 
the only thing is that if you are used to the num_num inc this feels small . 
it s very stable and fast ,  without too much motor noise or the annoying ozone smell that plagues some machines . 
i wish there was a button you could push that would release the pressure in the canister . 
nice case but can t use therefore i got a new phone right . 
it s truly a gourmet item that s worth the bother . 
still leaks a bit if you turn it over ,  but keeps odors out fairly well . 
our carpets had not been cleaned in six years . 
the next morning the odor was creeping back . 
it s very light and easy to carry around . 
i am using this on my samsung reality ,  and everything worked very well . 
keeps the phone protected ,  but is still very light . 
but do not try to use it one handed . 
there is definitely a certain visible point on the rubber layer you re not supposed to push the cards past . 
i can also use it at home in my kitchen and have done chickens and stews . 
it should be backlit .  .  .  . that is my feeling about any remote . 
keep the microwave clean of spatters and pops . 
i was worried these filters might not be available anymore . 
also ,  after buying this ,  i googled for otterbox warranty and found that they have a warranty for a year . 
i have switched to using this as my default num_extend
i have had this battery for over a year now . 
i never noticed balance on a knife before ,  but the shun feels good in my hand . 
this is a must ,  as bacterium have to grow at the right temp . 
too bad they don t have some kind of automatic reset . 
wet towels are heavy ! this hamper is just perfect for my need . 
it is a great buy for the price . 
if you want to use it in the left ear ,  the phone should be on that side . 
the seasoning is good for first time use . 
it doesnt make your phone that much bigger really . 
i don t know how you could form good cones without it . 
it works with not only the newest iphone num_num but also older models . 
i didn t have the problem that other people did about steam leaking out of the cover . 
i d just guess they ve lasted num_num years each and for the small purchase price i consider them a bargain . 
anyone concerned with emergency preparation should have a set of these stashed around the house . 
the rubber lining on the edges does start to peel after a while though . 
the cigarette charger included has stopped working ,  forcing me to bring my ipod inside every few days  the trials !   . 
since i have a separate grinder ,  it doesn t need to masticate for me . 
i don t even check for contact any more . 
so i can hit play and the audiobook will play ,  but i can t pause ,  forward or back . 
they really did a nice job with this case . 
i just reordered these sturdy and most useful hangers . 
it is simply amazing to see the difference a good pan makes . 
make certain to use the correct socket to charge the ipad . 
we ordered this to have extra chargers in a second location . 
that seems to be a product of apples design rather than an otterbox issue . 
well if i don t remove the pitcher as soon as the washer is finished ,  the parts start to rust . 
bought another tractor ,  built another shed ,  buying three more for the new shed . 
fits the samsung galaxy s num_num for sprint perfectly . 
i bought a pur faucet filtration device ,  but didn t have all the hardware to install . 
it sounded too good to be true ,  and i still don t believe how well it works . 
i ve owned several pressure cookers over the years . 
very pretty ,  and very happy with this b pan . 
popcorn always pops well with very few ,  if any ,  old maids . 
i recommend charging overnight the first time or when fully discharged . 
i haven t put more than a few sheets in it ,  but they stay upright ,  as advertised . 
it s easy to use ,  easy to clean and very compact . 
the stainless carafe holds coffee at perfect drinking temp for hours . 
i dropped my phone yesterday and was glad to have this rubbery protection instead of my usual hard case . 
i was turned on to otterbox last year for my blackberry ,  and it worked like a charm . 
but ,  i expected a higher capacity battery to weigh more . 
be absolutely sure the  pour  word on the top is in direct alignment with the pour spout . 
this is the best in ear bluetooth by far that i ve ever used . 
my only gripe is that the little sliding tabs move too easily . 
too much ice and you ll get something too thick to blend and you get chunks . 
these sprays burn at very low temperatures ,  creating a surface residue that may affect the pan s nonstick performance . 
this is the fourh farberware coffee pot i have bought . 
you can use it in portrait or landscape mode which is quite handy . 
he loved the color combination since he is a huge pittsburgh steelers fan . 
we got something similar for our flour  without the handle for pouring  . 
a sharp cutter has no place in a drawer . 
it clicks open and stays that way to utilize the clip as a stand to watch something . 
good feel in the hand ,  nicely made ,  reasonable price . 
so this is great tokeep them charged when we are on the road . 
i live alone and this is the perfect size . 
using a better grade of steel in the blade could make it the perfect opener . 
it s cute ,  the red color is the right shade ,  the logo looks good ,  and it fits . 
it has a camera ,  which my wife is unlikely ever to use . 
i m using the same recipe that i ve used for years . 
now if i could just find them for a little cheaper . 
for that year ,  the holster and shell protected my phone from any dings and drops . 
i ve had this coffeemaker for about num_num weeks . 
and about num_extend inches high total ,  about num_extend inches high inside . 
since then i ve not had issue and ipad pandora life has been good . 
i was able to get at least num_num charges with light ongoing use ,  on a full charge . 
i like to do breakfast ,  fry bacon ,  eggs .  .  .  . that kinda thing . 
also ,  i use both forks for the bigger ,  bulkier meat cuts with confidence . 
these glasses are not meant to be stacked . 
it wasn t too protecting tho just more of a nice look . 
it works fine and does what it says it would do . 
and this is great with the screen protector built in and she loves the lavender silicone cover . 
i think the reason is that the speakerphone does not use the same volume setting as the normal mode . 
it looks like many others i ve seen and i m sure it s adequate . 
this grinder is at the lower end of the  good  burr variety ,  but it does its job admirably . 
i can not recommend the ebelskivers high enough either . 
but when the battery dies ,  it doesn t hang up on your caller . 
after too many bent spoons to count ,  we broke down and bought this scoop . 
the plates and bowls are made in the usa ,  but the mugs are stoneware made in china . 
one small container for the corn versus storage for the large box with individual bags . 
this gets exact fit on my iphone num_extend
i bought this from empire accessory in tampa . 
the price on amazon is really good as well !  highly recommend this steamer !  . 
the minor negatives do not mean much compared to features and sound quality . 
can t wait to use this thing more around the holidays . 
this is the same bowl that comes with the kitchenaid mixer so it s a perfect fit . 
worth every penny and does not add much to the size of the phone . 
less money ,  less pan . for their purposes ,  both worth what they cost . 
they are all listed at rim s and num_num other different sites . 
i ve run this through the dish washer probably like num_num times since i bought it and its still sharp . 
cool ,  neat ,  easy to use ,  as long as its really quiet ,  no wind ,  no music ,  nobody else talking . 
the usb port in the back is excellent if i need to charge something else up alongside my phone . 
i don t see this skillet breaking down in my lifetime and then some . 
take it anywhere where you need to time something . 
the quality is good and the shipping is quick . 
i ordered two sets and was pleased to find out they fit on my large ,  rare earth magnetic hooks . 
i reminded her of her power bank i bought her . 
this maker puts water through the pipes hotter and gets more of the watchamacallit out of the grounds . 
this splatter screen works very well and seems to keep the grease from frying foods at a minimum . 
i needed a large stockpot ,  and i also wanted it to look nice in my kitchen . 
this slicer is as good as the ad says it is . 
they do work ,  but definitely don t last long . 
it helps to let it warm up about num_num mins before putting the pizza on it . 
there is an app you can load into your phone to brings out its full flavor of device . 
however ,  since a squeegee is provided with tha amazon product its certainly better than the ebay  specials  . 
want to cook a whole chicken or make stock from a turkey carcass ?  no problem at all . 
we have the num_extend skillet ,  along with the num_extend the round griddle ,  and num_num dutch ovens . 
somewhere deep in storage ,  i have the satin version of the aerolatte frother . 
i needed a number of cutting boards to prevent cross contamination; these have fit the bill perfectly so far . 
color is beautiful and i love the shape . 
only downfall i have if you don t wash them right away they are hard to clean . 
no ,  when the light turns from green to red again in a minute or two ,  my waffle is ready . 
i recommend doing the firmware update as soon as you get it . 
the first thing that impressed me about the units was the quality of the portafilters . 
canning jars are much less expensive than plastic containers over their life time . 
very happy i will not have drops of tea all over the counter any more . 
although smaller than it appears on line ,  this little thermometer is amazing at how quickly it reads the temperature . 
i use this pan very very often for pizza and it makes the pizza so good . 
oh yes ,  i have num_num cake stands now ,  but i like to put on a nice plate first . 
not fine china but definitely not easy to break . 
not great for a party unless you make a bunch beforehand . 
frankly ,  i think it is a steal . i highly recommend . 
for example ,  i can choose a num_num lb .  ,  num_extend lb . 
it is thick and heavy and reversible . it looks great on my kitchen counter . 
finally found sim cards that work at amazon . com . 
i use mine quite often and is just as easy to squeeze as the day i got it !  . 
treat it with respect as a blade for it is a great tool . 
but you might want to think twice if you re cooking for more than two . i highly recommend this steamer . 
anyone else have a better solution ?  other than that ,  she loves it . 
but like another person stated ,  it doesn t come with a brush to clean it up . 
we bought this to have an extra during a trip overseas . 
the clever handle ,  and rubberized non slip bottoms add enormous utility to the age old bowl . 
they are heat and dishwasher safe and work great . 
it feels more secure in my hands too . 
but as i said ,  it is picking up crumbs . 
it is easy to assemble ,  some assembly is required . 
more importantly ,  it takes up surprisingly little space on your stove top . 
i love popcorn and this makes microwaving it as easy as pie . 
i suspect these will last a long time since they re so well made . 
i m able to shred as more chess in num_num minutes that i could in num_num minutes previously . 
the is a great little frother with lots of speed and a nice quality feel in the hand . 
i think a clear acrylic might perform better . 
just as the original ,  could not tell any difference . 
i purchased a frying basket and use it as a stove top deep fryer . 
i was sold on all clad after my first use . 
this peeler is easy to hold and use . 
if that s the worst thing that happens to me on a given day ,  then i m having a good day . 
this is a great kit to go with the booster cradle . 
this case is more for style and looks as it offers no protection to your iphone . 
the quality is there ,  and the locking mechanism is strong . 
the num_extend is a more powerful device ,  with less graphics ability ,  but is a better phone . 
the zune hd started out with about half its battery charge and was plugged in the num_extend port . 
one of my favorite phones i ve ever owned . 
my expectation for ear buds under $ is limited . 
when the lid is closed it s sealed well enough bread smell doesnt invade the room !  . 
it s also nice that you never once have to touch the can lid . 
it also worked great on onions and cucumbers . 
battery life is long num_extend hours ,  about  and recharge is quick . 
we had the other kind and broke two of them . 
i have the feeling i ll be replacing this again in a few months of heavy use . 
the press works fine ,  and makes good coffee . 
they have worked great for over a month now . 
it drives me crazy especially while driving at night . 
this type of tool lasts for a few uses before it becomes unusable . 
these are lightweight ,  durable ,  dishwasher friendly ,  and have a classic design . 
i have found a case that i can love . 
i can surf using my dolfphin browser via thre mobile view or use the full firefox browser to surf . 
it came as was described ,  shipping right on time . 
these are a good design because they do not slip . 
it arrived early ,  so he s been letting me make christmas goodies with it . 
the separator i had before  that broke  had smaller holes ,  which i liked . 
the sound quality is great ,  the rubber molding helps reduce background noise ,  and the microphone seems to work well . 
there is somewhat of a rubber smell ,  but i expected that when you combine ,  rubber and heat . 
it is very loud ,  almost like a tiny hair dryer  basically what it is  . 
if it had a handle it would be a skillet lol . 
easy to use and makes cute pattern on the pancakes . 
just love this  !  !  perfect for reheating ,  baking etc . 
also ,  it s the perfect knife for leveling cake layers . 
i love my old wilton angled spatula that i use for the purpose it was made for . 
this item seems to be of the same quality as my other pans . 
this is great ,  it happens automatically so you can t forget to back up . 
i use it on my torchand and htc amaze . 
you already have frying pans and saute pans ,  i hope . 
this tape is amazing when it comes to keeping your device together . 
take the skillet out ,  and put it on the stovetop on high heat . 
i chose this popper after reading a number of reviews on several popcorn poppers . 
i don t like the george foreman grill because you can t really wash the grill surface very well . 
quite simply ,  it is the best there is . 
after our two eurekas died ,  we decided it was time to try a new brand of vacuum . 
if counter space in your kitchen is sparce ,  i strongly suggest purchasing this product . 
the sound quality is good and so is the microphone ,  though people sometimes tell me they hear background noise . 
i bought the battery with usb travel charger for about num_num month . 
it is much better than the num_extend one ,  there is only one very tiny rough edge . 
microwave popcorn tastes too greasy and has a funny chemical taste and smell . 
anywhere you want to have a towel handy . 
i purchased the white cover with the black piping . 
fits my sprint samsung galaxy pretty well with the exception of a very small gap on one side . 
i found the sound quality to be excellent ,  both in terms of listening and speaking . 
the white color is nice because it is a simple design . 
it;s a lot easier than using your finger . 
there s a lot of raw foodists out there that are the reason these companies charge ridiculous prices . 
i like this tea kettle as it is not huge doesn t take up a lot of space . 
saw this on amazon and after reading the reviews decided to order it . 
i wanted to give it some time before i reviewed these earphones ,  and num_num months later ,  here it is . 
my husband used this for frying a turkey and it cleaned up well ,  worked great . 
be sure to get a screen protector ,  as the screen scratches easily . 
good addition to the purchase of small memory products . 
at less than $ a screen protector ,  the price is good . 
the first microplanes i purchased had plastic support around the metal grater . 
i m so glad we got this and don t have a bad thing to say about it . 
just num_num hole from the vertical loaf machines . 
this does not collect lint ,  and it slides into your pocket really well . 
this car charger i use for all my devices with micro usb charger ports . 
i find the size perfect for most duties ,  even for cutting smaller meat like chicken breast . 
those who need mms on the iphone must jailbreak their phone so you can get access to these settings . 
about the cleanest way to pour honey without drips . 
the four pieces are well made and will be long lasting . 
the more you use it ,  the better it becomes . perfect size for two fried eggs !  . 
the bread maker did not give me the usual rise on my breads . 
i was expecting an improvement with a larger capacity ,  brand new battery from a recognizable brand . 
it has so many uses and is a great product to have . 
she pronounced names well ,  and spoke the sentences as if i was reading them back to myself . 
before we bought the last one ,  we tried the bissell proheat and hated it . 
my next purchase will be a bigger one !  and maybe a few as christmas presents ?  ?  . 
it is much better than one i had that broke so hopefully it will last a long time . 
the wood handle could be a bit longer . 
its sleek black exterior is consistent in color . 
screwed into wall ,  slightly wobbly ,  but otherwise excellent product . 
it also presses out garlic in a way that i ve never experienced before . 
but ,  that would take away part of the of ease of operation . 
in terms of simplicity and core functionality ,  i can t complain . 
shipper did not deliver by date given by amazon . 
this is a quality skillet that can withstand a lot . 
i haven t traveled with it ,  so i don t know how leak proof it is when tossed around . 
well ,  in my opinion the plastic trays in the dehydrator are not flat . 
just got tired of wireless headphones with my kindle ,  droid x and toshiba laptop . 
annatto seeds are about the hardest thing you would ever put into one of these . 
we had the most difficult time getting the bluetooth to work with our phone . 
the best one out there that i know of . 
you hold a veggie cleaver differently than you might hold your chef or santoku knife . 
just remember not to carry it in your hand luggage !  . 
you simply clip the unit to your visor . 
i purchased the farberware classic set over num_num years ago and the pieces look almost as good as new . 
i will never regret it for a second . 
what i didn t expect was how often i would use it for chopping . 
this is a good starter set if you are just getting into cake decorating . 
in general ,  measuring is easier and faster with this set . 
there s num_num in the pack ,  so if i mess you up i have num_num backups ,  which is great . 
i have not found this item to be  cheap  , just a neat little filter system with a neat little price . 
it is super durable . i ve only needed to replace the rubber gasket once . 
without going into too much detail ,  they suck ,  and the emerilware is just as bad . 
i ve been using both this and the mini cutter for three years . 
if you submerge the knife in the water overnight ,  the cutting edge will be damaged . 
my cooking is more of a rustic type with lots of slicing and chopping . 
i have two of them and they work pretty well . 
it is a lot easier to get the oval cup or spoon into containers . 
i used this for smaller fruit that might fall between the slats of the regular tray . 
instead of chips or other junk we got this . 
another option is to use an ipad num_extend amp charger . 
i d prefer a higher profile button ,  but that s just personal preference . 
i love this !  no more broken corks ,  or bits of cork in your wine . 
they sent me a new mixer from the factory and a free return vis ups for the defective unit . 
have to get used to the device taking over all sounds when connected ,  but it s an easy adjustment . 
it s a good thing and a bad thing ,  depending on the situation . 
they would not be without one ! i feel a little uncomfortable about keeping the heating element constantly plugged in . 
i remember my mom had a brita pitcher when i was younger and we liked it a lot . 
as good as the ones they sell in the mall for many times more . 
i like to use them for dishwashing when camping . 
don t overdo it or you can change the finish on your knives . 
i would tell everyone to have one of these . 
boom ,  num_num secondsa lot of people complain it s too tight . 
so ,  why num_num stars ?  because it is pretty low capacity . 
in traffic it isn t too bad ,  but i found myself not maintaining the correct or consistent speed at times . 
i anticipate that this knife will last many years . 
this was worth what i paid for it . 
the cleaning light has not gone on ,  so it can evidently hold even more . it is very easy to clean . 
the handset has a very nice rubberized feel and is very well built . 
it makes the most evenly baked bundt cake . 
my friend even noticed that my floors look lighter . my issue with it is that is seems kind of flimsy . 
does great in the kitchen and on smooth carpet on stairs . 
the directions to make the cinnamon rolls were in the instruction booklet . 
it s built very well and the num_extend tape securs it securly to the side of the transmission shifter . 
my cakes have come out perfectly level every time i use these . 
num_extend millimeter is small ,  you ll barely barely see it ,  it will look like its laying flat on the table . 
i ve used it with voip applications including skype and the avaya softphone . 
this set seemed like a really great deal . 
i like the female voice alerts that tells you exactly what the unit is doing . 
this is the second one i brought ,  and it s better than the first . 
it is a snap to clean up and easy to store . 
it works as well as the old reliable that has served me for so long . 
that light touch broke the pot and tought me an important lesson . 
i like my coffee strong ,  but not bitter ,  and not especially dark . 
easy to put on and lasts a long time of abuse . 
knit tops steam up in seconds ,  without stretching out of shape . 
you can tell that they are good quality and we have received numerous compliments on them . 
love how the plug into the headset jack of my ipad . 
i keep this in my purse hooked to one of my outside pockets . 
we have hardwood floors ,  but a few rugs that need vacuuming . 
i m a vegan and eat a lot of live food and make a lot of smoothies with frozen bananas . 
it may show smudges a little more than the glass but they are easily wiped off . 
it would be a fair value at half  or less  of the cost . 
it worked well ,  but didn t keep the fine afghanistan dust out . 
out of all of the third party chargers ,  this one feels the most comfortable and trustable . 
overtime ,  my older grinder lid edges chipped away . 
have not tried them with a lot of num_extend draw items but i expect it to delivery . 
the open end makes it easy to put the pants on and take them off . 
the blade is extremely sharp ,  and is a breeze to clean . 
i would recommend this product to people i know . 
i ve tried many of them ,  even the num_extend callipod adapter . 
husband has dozens of ties  uses none of them  . 
they paired easily and sounded very nice  they have chip enhanced bass  . 
there are simply none that get consistently good reviews . 
the batteris are working fine and seem to last maybe an hour or two more than the oem battery . 
i haven t used the chopper yet ,  but it s nice that it comes with it . 
i think it will perform as described and i will be a satisfied user of its capabilities . 
this thing works great for my iphone num_extend
i m not but on typing ,  so i ll simply say i love this product . 
and it s microwave friendly so i use this to warm up milk for my latte every morning . 
very handy . absolutely no problem with what some reviewers said about it flinging your toast into the air . 
this case is great if you need a  carry all  case . 
i got mine included in a utility crock . 
we share the first two and the rest goes into this thermos . at lunchtime ,  i have hot coffee . 
you don t need nonstick pans to make these special rice dishes . 
this is my num_extend coffee maker that i ve bought in num_num yrs . 
it has some weird  planetary mixing action ,   but whatever that means ,  it mixes mostly everything evenly . 
so far i have sauted onions ,  made omelets ,  browned meat and fish and simmered one pot meals in this . 
we wanted to get some spare batteries just in case we needed them . 
they secret is to let the pan get warm then add the cooking fat . 
i guess i ll have to check with samsung . 
it would have been a great improvement if they had created them with welded handles . 
i also tried a more buttery shortbread type recipe and that worked great too . 
but next time i d buy two so a friend or kid can help me make them . 
nice handle ,  nice feel ,  great for my everyday cooking . 
i bought this without reading the reviews and yes this battery is the num_num mah battery . 
i chose this filter to replace an old one ,  and it works perfect . 
when i removed the fan from the box ,  there was obviously something loose in it . 
i was happy that they warrantied an unlocked international device . 
but i m not going to do any more searching because this one looked and functioned so well . 
i can t say enough about how much i love cooking on lodge cast iron . 
i now make homemade pizza at least once a week because the results are so good . and it s versatile . 
however ,  it s not particularly better than the other ones . 
i haven t opened or used this yet as it is a gift for my daughter . 
i use a voyager pro+ and a wireless telephone headset for long teleconferences . 
its teeth are somewhat too brutal for tomatoes and hard cheese . 
extremely easy to activate redial and other functions on the device while you are repositioning it . 
the second batch i got covers it all up better but still not like the premium protectors . 
the three interchangeable accessory blades easily drop in place and fasten with a screw on each end . 
i have really enjoyed using this funnel ,  a take on a very old design concept . 
i charged the battery without a problem ,  works great with my num_extend the charge also . 
we have been using them for a year now and r still wowed . 
i have a cat ,  and pretty bad allergies in general  not to cats ,  thankfully  . 
i got this machine for our wedding num_num years ago . 
gives a neater look when you don t have a usb cord plugged to it when not in use . 
dining set . it was shipped ups ,  which probably not a good thing since they are known for banging up things . 
these are hard to find now days since everything comes in plastic bottles now . 
i eat two at bedtime and no longer eat other junk food . 
easy to use ,  very responsive on an ipad num_extend
will definitely buy more from this seller when needed . 
making eggs over easy or sauteing onions ,  the pan is perfect . 
the tote is a added plus ,  since i do share meals with friends . 
it rarely gets to a point where it is a real nuisance ,  but it does happen . 
it makes a good amount of noise when running and definitely would not be safe for children . 
the manual is a little daunting at first . 
they look almost as new as the day i bought them . 
this is the neatest ,  easiest cooking tool i have ever used . 
my grandaugher took the one that looks like a panda bear face . 
if you start cleaning fast enough ,  the cleanup is a breeze . 
one of the very few  kitchen gadgets  that does exactly what it s supposed to do simply and easily . 
after just having purchased my new iphone num_extend i wanted a case that would help protect my investment . 
the key to this is making sure the dough is not too thick to go through the rollers . 
oh my !  it is so easy to use . 
they are adequate but seem to come loose with little effort . 
now i just use it for my license and phone when i go thru the airport every week . 
completely disassembles and is therefore easy to num_extend
i also suggest pairing it with the mouse by the same company for the same purpose . 
heavy duty ,  and it s nice that it has the little pocket in front to hold items if need be . 
the phone charged quickly and fully with no problems at all . 
this is very likely that best accessory that i have purchased for my iphone . 
works nicely for filling the coffee maker and the pet water bowels . 
there really isn t much more to say about this . 
drinking wine is like a truth serum ,  but be careful ,  too much truth can get you into trouble .

i m just starting to cycle it now ,  i just got it . 
and all you have to do is periodically vacuum the dust filter and it is good to go again . 
we have bose home theatre and was thrilled to see the execute is just as fantastic . 
i would not recommend this vac for large carpeted areas . 
charges iphone and can also manage my music . 
this stylus is a good size and works well . 
because of the design on back no one recognize the skin at all . 
it takes a bit of practice and in the beginning sometimes it turns out better than other times .

this item is high quality and i recommend it . 
i unplugged it at num_num am april num_extend
i just wish it were another foot long .

most of the things that are measured aren t that heavy . 
cookies are all of equal size and helps bake to the same doneness . 
and it has enough juice to charge the one x fully . 
we just received this in as a gift for a relative and we re very happy with it . 
the case is durable and is made of a great material . 
or make an ice ring in it for punch bowl . 
as are all protectors ,  it takes a bit of patience to apply . 
still use it for baking gifts and contributions to bake sales and various dinners . 
i have been using this case for about a month . 
it has a nice feel and i expect it to last probably my entire lifetime . 
my biggest complaint was that the coffee wasn t hot enough when it came out . 
using the big heart to make my daughters sandwich . 
i ordered this for a variety of reasons :  num_extend

looks terrific ,  protects against damage if you drop your phone . 
best to have something that fits the bill correctly than destroy your hardware . 
fit s nicely in my num_extend cigarett closet ,  the lid closes too . 
our cats have learned to pay close attention when they see these come out !  . 
it s also currently geared for the consumer market  and not the enterprise segment  . 
i tend to brew at slightly cooler temperature anyway  tried num_extend to num_extend
just like the other reviews ,  i am very happy with how strong the magnet is on this holder . 
this one has the original shapes ,  but is so much faster . 
i use the apple ipad and had the opportunity to try this stylus . 
stays on the ear nicely ,  lasts all day ,  good sound ,  works flawlessly with my galaxy num_extend
i love the color ,  happy that it came in something other than plain old black !  . 
the cups are a little heavier  but not much  than the plates but i like that . 
we have used this wok in an office to make lunches for the employees for the last num_num months . 
we have had this unit for over a year .

the easily hold four or five costumes with puffy tutus . 
today i am enjoying thanks to this perculator coffee that smells and taste like my father s cup of coffee . 
i was seriously doubtful because of how simple it was . 
despite the glitch ,  it s still worthwhile to be able to store my food in glass . 
phone calls sound good and i ve been told i sound ok on the other end . 
back num_num years ago ,  my mom had a panasonic bread maker . 
very happy that i got this and returned the bose speaker . 
i can see this lasting for a long time . 
i used this all the time when i had my blackberry bold num_num as well as my blackberry playbook . 
i just scrape everything into a trashcan and it makes wiping the counters down a breeze . 
good protection and other than increasing the size of the phone dramatically there are few drawbacks . 
together ,  these frequencies cover europe ,  much of the u . s . 
i ordered this vacuum because all it needed was a bag . 
the blades are still as sharp as ever . 
any suggestion of it being too expensive would be considered pound foolish . 
in it and it grills very well  leaves great grill marks  . 
just brush the thing out with a stiff pastry num_extend
i must also compliment the company on its service . 
it s just a test platform for android apps now that i have an iphone as my primary . 
i love the calphalon pans that i have purchased from amazon . com . 
she s asked me to keep an eye out for a sale for her . 
cuts through rock hard ice cream no problems . 
also provide space for two pans ,  pots ,  skillets ,  lids ,  etc . 
we have dropped these on occasion and they never broke ,  cracked ,  or chipped . 
we use this for our french press coffee . 
some have said qi wireless chargers charge slower than standard chargers . 
i just dump my corn in a different bowl and enjoy . 
after all it has an num_extend amp motor . 
looks really cute with different colored stirrers too . 
much better than those plastic dog food storage units . 
their are earpieces and over the head options . 
slides in and out of pocket with ease . 
i want different sizes to make different style cakes ,  i will be ordering those soon !  . 
so i really do like the feature of having the place to store the credit cards . 
i searched java junkie message boards and decided to give the aerolatte a try . 
and yes ,  as someone else mentioned ,  an occasional seed falls through . 
at num_num watts ,  the pad does a fine job with little effect on my electric bill . 
the shipping packaging was way over the top . 
these stylus work with all my samsung products . 
its defiantly brighter than a point and click flash . 
would highly recommend to anyone with or without arthritis who has problems opening jars .  . works on different sizes !  . 
the extra cables and tips do come in handy ,  but i found the tips are prone to falling off . 
so after first considering an extractor  bad idea for citrus  ,  i starting looking at simple juicers . 
i also connected to a iphone and it also works . 
i bought this nearly two years ago through amazon as a refurbished unit . 
age have an effect ?  my toaster oven has the same problem though and it s newer than the stove . 
if you re a technophobe ,  make sure you have some help when your order arrives . 
what the heck was i holding back on ?  it doesn t add much bulk .

i can wear the headset for about an hour without needing to remove them . 
i do not use them ,  but he loved them . 
it can be used for soups ,  porridge ,  rice ,  cereal ,  etc . 
this is very easy to use; it s just like another small appliance you can use on your counter top . 
i like the folio because i don t want the screen exposed . 
this little machine is great !  cleans up messes thoroughly by sucking it out of your carpet . 
friends whom i invite over want to take this back with them . 
even with the display dimmed ,  it is too bright to use as a bedside clock . 
one did not work and the seller quickly replaced it . 
nice size for one or two pieces of pizza . 
this bodum cleans up in a jiffy ,  no filter papers needed ,  and makes great coffee . 
wish the tip was a bit thinner so it s easier to get it inside the oyster . 
also have the num_num inch one for cutting smaller vegetables . 
it heats up quick and evenly which is nice . 
i wish i had purchased this years ago rather than using regular spoons to dish out cookies . 
it cancels noise out just fine ,  and i hear very well . 
booyah !  i normally put my forks ,  plates ,  and other items in the drainer so things dry well . 
jog it a little ,  and it shakes easily . 
we used this pot all summer long for canning tomatoes and jelly . 
this is the third presto coffee maker i ve bought .

can t go wrong for less than a buck including postage . 
i own several lodge cast iron pots and pans .  .  . love them . 
i don t use my iphone any more except for some video and music . 
used on a plane and it was quieter than my bose . 
not totally the case s fault as my boys liked to pick apart the silicon from the hard case . 
they help get most of the gunk off and are well worth their modest price . 
one of the kitchen chores i really hate to do is to open cans with a manual can opener . 
we got submitted a claim and mophie sent us a new one no cost . 
have yet to find an oxo kitchen tool i didn t like . 
i just received the product and it slipped right onto my bionic with no hassle at all . 
i will follow up if i have trouble . 
it s well made ,  can be calibrated ,  and works nicely . 
the last ingredient to go into the machine is the yeast . 
what else is ther to say ,  it works as advertised . 
they arrived before i expected them and were well packed . 
i recommend never allow the battery to downloadgood price ,  works with num_extend and num_extend for venezuela . 
it used to be mounted on my windshield ,  but i ve now put it on my dashboard . 
i am a total clutz ,  and this case has saved my phone on more than one occasion . 
we bought one in scarlet and one in purple and they were perfectly sized . 
it protects and looks just like an otter box . 
if you are looking for a good slicer this is the one you need . 
i sent my knives in and waited for an email requesting payment . 
but i was able to fit it into one side vertically and it works great . 
this air purifier seems to help reduce the dust collecting on my furniture and improve the air quality . 
this was the cheapest i have found it . 
i have used it to make a cup of tea also . 
i just use the steel every once in a while . 
they have an iphone num_num and liked the way it looked . 
as with the silly blue light ,  i have no use for the gaily colored ends . 
really though ,  you cannot go wrong with the price of this set . 
it is a nice heavyweight pan ,  and the price can t be beat . 
it feels good in the hand and maintains its  good looks after a lot of use . 
this pan seemed mid price reasonable ,  and the cuisinart name grabbed my attention immediately . 
these are the best liners i have ever used . 
this case was perfect for that ,  and it is a beautiful color and unique design . 
overall ,  i am very pleased with this product . 
i m sure this is a  just in case  policy . 
i m so glad i did !  this is beautiful . 
these are by far the best value for the money . 
i also bought from amazon num_num stylus for $
if this style of case is what your looking for ,  then this is the case to buy . 
i have tested this device pretty extensively for work and home . 
i hope my headsetcontinues to be very good as it is now . thank you . 
the final screen is great for ricing potatoes . 
it fits perfectly and has a handy pocket . 
and the white color is pretty enough to leave out so it is handy when i need it . 
i have dropped my phone numerous times and not a scratch . 
i haven t actually used this machine ,  or tasted any bread from it . 
as a diabetic i am taking every effective measure to remain in control with diet and exercise . 
also  ,  great to get rid of any smells as well . 
we received this coffee maker as a christmas gift for a camper trailer . 
i wanted to buy the same phone but they sell very expensive and there are few options . 
if you re willing to live with a butt ugly color  i am  you can save loads of money . 
the profiserie sitram line is easier and  softer  to handle . 
it was late because of the chinese new year . 
when i tried to pour out the juice ,  it failed miserably ,  with the oil dripping all over . 
sometimes i get air pockets if i don t arrange the food so . 
this item arrived on time and is an excellent purchase . 
it has a large capacity bin that holds several cloves of garlic . 
i used it to cut steak for a stir fry and for a loaf of bread . 
in recient years i have worked on aquiring quite a selection of henckle knives . 
honestly ,  though ,  i d have to remove the protector to verify that . 
i ve only had this mug a short time  a week or so  ,  but i ve grown to love it . 
the rotating arms stir the kernels as they heat . 
i sure have and hope the rest of my life is a long way away . 
i love the fact that the bowl and cover are dishwasher safe . 
i poor my coffee in and enjoy my delicious fancy coffee . 
that shark is going right back to the store and i ll be saving $ to boot . 
great portable champagne chiller to keep the bubbly cold while outdoors at picnics . 
this one is heavy enough  but not too heavy  and is of very good quality . 
so ,  i lifted it with scotch tape and replaced it . so ,  it takes time and definitively patience . 
it seemed like a good idea and it was !  my husband and i both love it . 
i may even go out and get one of my own for the other car . 
it arrived unblemished and has remained so after much use . 
they work just as well as another much more expensive stylus i bought a while back . 
highly recommended for anyone wanting to steam single servings of fresh vegetables . 
grip feels good in hand and works smoothly as i expected from a cooks country rating . 
give the machine the chance to reverse motion ,  and let it rest after num_num minutes of work . 
the feature i like best on this phone is the volume control . 
the grinder is a bit loud ,  but the results are fantastic !  . 
stacking the bowls with out their lids on is not advised . 
the iphone is awsome yes ,  but its kinda big to use as a cellphone . 
what a mistake !  it is beautiful ,  sharp ,  extremely well balanced and obviously well made . 
immediately replaced it with this one from amazon . 
for example ,  a workout app that wants to access phone s contact list and reads phone account info . 
after num_num weeks and about num_num loaves ,  i am very happy with the machine . 
we collect fiesta and the tumblers are one of our favourite pieces . 
so ,  if you sit on them ,  as one user mentioned ,  you will break them . 
as soon as you hear the first small pop  about num_num minute  ,  quickly !  place the measuring cup on top . 
 the mallet hitting surface is smaller .   some reviewers say the silver starts coming off the oxo over time . 
prominently printed on the package is an american flag and the logo ,   an american company  . 
these are some of the best screen covers ever . 
didn t get suckered into a third party seller . 
the mesh is good enough to sift cake flower . 
took it on vacation with me and it worked great !  . 
this table holds my small ,  num_extend refrigerator and my num_extend keurig coffee maker . 
i realized all at once that i d never even held a real knife before . 
corer works well for cupcakes ,  the main reason i bought it . 
such an amazing pan good size and very nice to sear and cook meat . 
sometimes there is a problem getting it to seal ,  but you just need to tweek it a little . 
this probe thermometer worked great and has done its job so far . 
this otter box is perfect for my motorola atrix hd mobile phone . 
i even add a bit of soap  yea ,  i know what the  rules  are for cast iron . 
i love this product although i could have done without the drama of it getting lost in shipping . 
over the last few years we have taken to drinking a bottle of wine with dinner nearly every day . 
unactivated upon arrival and ready to be used with any mobile phone or tablet . 
i would be hard pressed t find any features that i would like to change or add . 
it was like a new apple brand charger . 
a real boon for things like alphabet tracing games . 
there is no way to turn the light off . 
i received this product last year as a christmas gift . 
this is good price and authentic nokia brand . 
i m sure if they were exactly the size of the glass ,  it would be much more difficult to install . 
as a result ,  the enamel doesn t chip as easily as cheaper enamel ware . 
any leftovers stay in the basket and are stored in the fridge . 
with each use ,  my knives get better and better . 
i use it with my blackberry num_num and fits perfect ,  and the price is perfect . 
quick shipment was provided by the vendor and item was exactly as described . 
it s my favorite gift for my cooking friends . 
the little hooks will hold disposable razors but not the ones with larger heads . 
after a few minutes ,  i depress the plunger . 
arrived on time but not as depicted in picture slightly different but the fit is awesome . 
however ,  the indicator light was a bit too bright although i like the blue color better than red . 
i love it even more than my programmable ,  large crock pot versaware pro . i love the smaller size . 
it works better with the roller bar engaged . 
i ve had it on for over a month and its holding up great . 
i can t see the metal jar bottom breaking . 
buy it . i have noticed the big price differences from one store to the other . 
it s actually nice that it isn t thick because then it would be more difficult to operate a touch screen . 
both were very durable ,  comfortable and had just the right length handles for me . 
i run bluetooth ,  play music for hours ,  gps is always on and it doesn t drain battery as num_extend does . 
can t argue with the price but had a lot of trouble with air build up . 
this is a great cost effective way to add a bluetooth speakerphone to any vehicle . 
nice look ,  easy directions on how to rinse out filter . 
it s nice to have a phone that the battery does not die on you . 
sharpen only the smooth side of serrated knife blade . 
these went up easy ,  look nice and were a good price . 
if you want to make a fashion statement ,  buy ring or a rolex . 
all in all i would definately recomend this purchase . 
went back and forth on whether i should purchase the quilted cover . 
ordered this grill so we could grill indoors during harsh montana winters when outdoor grilling is impossible . 
if you don t ,  you will most likely have negative results . 
i like that i can use this pitcher for a multitude of tasks ,  yogurt being just one . 
it s especially a good price when you get it in your gold box like i have been seeing lately !  . 
they handle bass pretty well ,  and i haven t had any issues with them so far . 
suspect that will be the end of the line for blackberry and me . 
my camp stove is hot ,  i think it s hotter than my home stove . 
the other was to use the relatively benign sea salt sold by trader joe s . 
very clear again more so than others and a great price . 
many reviews cited a problem with the wire not dropping into the marble groove for it . 
there are two reasons to have a pot rack . 
helps not holding phone , or searching on dash or pocket . 
i added the extra powdered milk ,  which did thicken the yogurt so it came out just as i wanted . 
it looks very nice ,  makes great coffee and i think it will last for a long time . 
shipping would be at my cost and i no longer had the original box . 
 they use it for hot tea  of course .  . can t push the button . 
it s scary ,  sharp blades really do a number on my coffee beans . 
follow the directions for heating the milk religiously . 
please refer to the number one review here by kathleen . 
i love the travel mug that comes with it . 
it also interfers with the touch screen a little bit . 
it does not leak while pouring and definitly keeps the coffee hot for num_extend drinkable for num_extend
this coffee maker produces a great tasting cup of coffee . 
it gave my phone really good protection and it hasn t failed me . 
now i have perfect bread every time i bake !  . 
and you cannot blindly trust any of amazon s add l purchase recommendations . 
 push all three buttons for num_num seconds  they then asked me to return it for replacement . 
for most meats very little effort is needed to get the job done . 
it was the same price so buying it from amazon will be no different . 
installing the case and included screen protector is fairly simple . 
its simple to take off and put back on . 
it fit like a glove !  very easy to replace the battery in my verizon iphone num_extend
i thought i would  upgrade  him a little and purchased this bb flip for him . 
a great car charger that works with various android devices . 
nice tight seal and the wine is keeping it s fresh bottle flavor . 
the data is more datery and the phone is more phoney in general . 
for this size this is a great deal . 
just a light cleaning after use and they are ready to go again . 
seems well built and i am looking forward to using it . 
for anyone who loves animal prints this phone case is ideal . 
there is no need to wash it if you handle it properly . 
not all salad spinners are created alike ,  but this is up there with the best . 
the unit is capable of very thin slices with meat ,  cheeses ,  and bread . 
the side walls are shallow so don t overload it . 
all the necessary ports and buttons are exposed . 
knowing my oil is at the proper temperature has moved my wings up to the level of perfection . 
i thouhgt about buying the one touch can opener till i read the reviews . 
i like it much better than geting dog step as they take up too much room . 
i received these sooner than the shipping date which was a plus . 
i put the stem in the pot ,  then put the covered basket on top of the stem . 
occasionally spritz on some cooking spray  every num_num uses or so  . 
when it says motorola you can t go wrong . 
luckily my phone did not get damaged during the fall . 
i use num_num heaping tablespoons ,  and sometimes one for the pot if i want it richer . 
it feels strong and durable and thick and for my num_extend mixer it covers it plenty . 
i was leery at first ,  thinking this would keep my coffee hotter than a couple of hours . 
i m glad to have the option of buying it without great expense online ,  this is cool ,  i hope . 
this one went on easily ,  with no bubbles at all . 
the bags keeps the moths away from my wool suits . 
it has a nice irridescent glow and as far as i can tell ,  fits nicely in two parts . 
the egg slides right out without any problem at all ,  and they re very easy to clean . 
after doing extensive research i decided to purchase the kitchenaid pro num_extend
when i was going through our school s security system ,  i heard a slight buzzing . 
my search for the best  everyday  num_extend case may finally be over . 
what an ingenious way to reappropriate an unused part of your car stereo system . 
this is just what i needed !  works great !  . 
the hash pattern is a little different on this one but the quality i feel is identical . 
i use this daily ,  and it is one of the most useful things in my kitchen . 
got this for my wife for a christmas present . 
i worked with amazon and it doesn t show up in internet explorer . 
i hand wash it and oil it whenever i oil my cutting board . 
sometimes i forgot it was on there it looked so great . 
i ve been fighting with a num_num year old bundt pan .  .  . so many ruined cakes no matter what i did . 
each blade gained such a sharp edge gently slicing through paper with incredible ease . 
it also works great to place leftovers in the freezer . 
i use the stereo part for bowling and working out . 
i love the heft to this can opener . 
i do love the organic feel of using the clay . 
it is reasonably priced and sturdy ,  and doesn t take up much space . 
if you are the designated ironer for your family ,  it might not be a chore you relish . 
i would definitely recommend these along with a matching shower curtain rod . 
i installed this in an existing opening in my dash and hard wired it . 
i have no antetragus  the thingy above the lobe that holds flat ear buds in  . 
heavier jeans wouldn t work ,  but skinny jeans do . 
they give you a cleaning cloth with it . 
i find over the years this was good advice and have not had any problems . 
seems like some other people have the same issue . 
they work well and keep a good flavor to whatever coffee you run through them . 
i purchased this skillet after reading many reviews . 
this is best to use when you are sitting down say at a desk or on your bed . 
at the end of the day they didn t do a much better job than these . 
but it s a problem . i will buy this brand again . 
this thing gets pretty hot being aluminum ,  but cools down quickly due to same reason after it s emptied . 
i d have given it num_num stars if it had been dead on accurate . 
it was exactly what i was looking for . 
i use this egg timer at least once a week and nearly everytime have perfect eggs . 
but i decided to try the jabra ear gels that are available for the jawbone . 
or give her mine and buy second for myself . 
the rubber handles allow for a very easy grip . 
and there certainly are plenty of different colors available !  . 
so far ,  it seems very sturdy and solid . 
all the function button work !  !  !  !  !   at least with my iphone num_extend which is a problem with most bluetooth headsets . 
just clean with little or no soup to retain the non stick effect . 
from the looks of them ,  i will be surprised if there are any problems putting them in the dishwasher . 
this is also the identical size of the hopper in the rosle garlc press . 
the phone is otherwise identical to its silver twin . 
plus whatever charging of iphones and itouches that my family members do . 
now ,  more than num_num months later ,  they start to be somewhat loose . 
you really can use garlic that has not been peeled . 
but the glass ones are fragile ,  and this one isn t . 
like the led and the fact that it s a name brand . 
it offers excellent protection at a great price . 
this is good for about num_num full charge to the iphone num_extend
just wait until it cools down and wipe with a clean damp cloth . 
seem to be braising meats so not needing to tenderize too many ,  anymore . 
the only concern i have is the case looked somewhat used . 
when i saw this single cup coffee maker i thought i would give it a try first . 
these kitchen shears are fantastic and save me tons of money . 
i ordered these cases because i figured i d get them for a great price . 
after stuggling with a cheap plastic press ,  this is nirvana . 
if your cell phone is bluetooth ,  you can speak more comfortably with this handset than holding the cell . 
i saw in the manual where it says that is normal . 
the extra wide slot is great for large ,  specialty shop bagels . 
it holds a bigger quantity than my previous mini chopper and does a better job . 
but anker did a really good job in product and customer service here . 
even though it s more rounded ,  it s actually a bit too well rounded for the bowl i use . 
this was exactly the same battery as the one in my samsung droid charge . 
have purchased as many of these fiesta bowls as i can . 
as i m waiting to buy a new phone ,  i still need to keep my phone alive . 
i read the recent reviews and it seems one either love it or hate it . 
i d say each fan lasts through a couple years of use in the spring and fall . 
the calendar on the num_extend is the worst calendar i ve ever seen on a smart phone . 
i believe it is the internal water filter that makes the difference . 
not a bad case !  it protected my hubby s phone and had a cool design . 
i turn on the twin fans and it takes out all the smell of indian food out the window . 
this will stay on my counter and i know it will be used often . 
i got it for my husband and he is a plumber and therefore is extremely rough on his phones . 
this product was delivered promptly and i am very satisfied with it . 
my wife whom is the primary user of this unit reports that she is very happy with it . 
i got the first one on perfect the first try with absolutely no air bubbles . 
i couldn t be happier with how they have worked . 
then i found this one in num_num on amazon and ordered it . 
i joined prime mail and got it the next day after ordering !  . 
num_extend oz isn t small ,  but the pitcher is surprisingly little . 
i received the item within the week and wasn t expecting it until weeks later . 
but again ,  really nice little gadget for the price . 
i don t know about you guys ,  but i personally preferred this; no glare . 
oh well ,  i guess i can live with that !   :  buy it . 
i like that it is bagless and filter can be simply rinsed out and reused . 
yes i do have other measuring cups for dry products ,  but i always use this for liquids . 
i recommend getting a second rack for it to keep jars straight and upright when stacking in layers . 
this is my second calphalon one nonstick griddle . 
one port is num_extend while the other is num_extend
it fits my ear well and it comes with clear pieces to wrap around your outer ear . 
this was a wedding gift so i cannot actually rate the product . 
love the size of this num_num quart serving bowl . 
make sure to adjust the volume when you put your earphone after driving . 
even if you leave it on the heat too long it doesn t over cook your coffee . 
not one of those gadgets that makes your life harder but much easier . 
product is just what it s supposed to be . 
this eventually made me dread cooking on it because it was such a tedious task to degrease and rinse . 
of course as stout as these things are ,  it s probably more about protecting the shipping truck than the mugs . 
it says a pack of three and mine came with five !  guess some were stuck together during packaging . 
the spring whisk is one of my favorite kitchen tools . 
therefore ,  it gets heavy regular use and has stood up to that use surprisingly well . 
this is the first usb cigarette port adapter i ve used that sits flush in the socket . 
they stack awkwardly due to the handles but they do stack . 
when this case calls itself the defender ,  they are not kidding . 
i m not a blender snob ,  and simply wanted a piece that fit and did its job . 
even so ,  no acceptable crema and the espresso tasted not as good as this machine . 
it has the right size just fit into my wok . 
this cable is an economical choice for a backup to the cable that came with your device . 
the repair was pretty straight forward while watching you tube . 
i was shocked to feel how heavy this small piece was . 
every chef says the best mashed potatoes are made with a ricer so i treated myself to this one . 
i have gone though num_num blades and seals num_num locking rings and one shock coupling . 
i m using this cable to plug my ipod touch into my stereo at work . 
the stock phone is difficult for me to hold on to without it slipping out of my hand . 
and both items came in the same box . 
this strainer has a very fine mesh ,  as was noted by another reviewer ,  so i decided to try it . 
however ,  if it does work ,  i will faithfully report how much better it does than the cuisinart . 
i have this is both rough and smooth stone . 
exactly as described ,  sturdy ,  and the double usb ports are so useful . 
these headphones have great sound and are extremely comfortable . 
have reheated many things on this ,  and have made toast as well ,  it really works great . 
i didn t even have a year yet and it s now trash . 
this occurred first time out of the box ,  so i sent it back to amazon . 
after doing this i have never had any trouble . 
i like the extra voices you can download through the app . 
my first measuring cups were little multicolored plastic . 
to me ,  that convenience alone is worth the price tag . 
i moved the star rating to num_num stars since it s very nice and easy to use . 
the handle does get a little hot though ,  but not bad . 
since i ordered num_num boxes ,  that savings was even greater . 
we ve gone through a couple of pans and sets of paddles . 
sturdy construction means you can really stuff and compress the bags into this holder . 
simple !  ! cleaning is no problem at all ,  even for my husband . 
stamped size on oversized lip helps to quickly identify size and they are easy to grab with oven mitts . 
of the other four tries ,  they ranged from a very simple white bread to a raisin rye . 
i m happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone . 
some reviews negatively comment on how thin the blade is . 
i did not buy them to make iced tea ,  so this is not a problem for me . 
i always liked the shape of the samsung cord . 
i even tried a new num_extend to num_extend adapter with no luck . 
this is by far my most used kitchen gadget . 
they are doing this great little appliance an injustice !  highly recommend . 
i was a little worried when it came in and i looked at the instructions . 
finally ,  i figured out what was going on . 
ordering and getting the item on time was a breeze . 
i like these the best after trying some others . 
it is wonderful to have all my cookware right in arm s reach ,  yet out of the way . 
does a great job for all deep frying . 
filling my old iron with water was a pain . 
if you need belts this is the place to shop . 
i read that some people had trouble with the drip and that it spilled . 
there was too much of a gap between the beater and the bowl . 
saw a recipe on pinterest for crumpets with strawberry balsamic jam ,  and had to make it . 
over all i like this product for the size and extended power it provides . 
coffee type drip brewers many tests showed that coffee drinkers lived shorter lifespan than non users . 
the clean cut it makes with little to no use of pressure is great . 
have used it twice now ,  eggs come out tall and smaller than the english muffin but cooked perfectly . 
but as far as this product goes it does the job and arrived fast . 
for years i had a professional steamer that i liked fine but it was annoying to have around . 
i am one of those guys who drops his phone a lot . 
once i added the other ingredients i was amazed at how nothing seemed to stick to the pot . 
this is my second one as i kept the other at my office . 
for the next part of my experiment ,  i poured it out and refilled it ,  again halfway . 
thanks to cooks illustrated for another wonderful recommendation !  . 
didn t even have to adjust the leveling screws . 
i finally decided to take a chance on the jambox . 
i was happy with the service and the product was exactly what the description stated !  would by here again !  . 
the gel has a very nice feel to it . 
i am a big fan of this one . 
it s simple to use ,  and has a magnet and a stand on the back . 
it was a bit of a pain to mount this thing . 
this product was just what i needed in my new kitchen . 
xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xdx . 
if you re thinking of them for wine service ,  though ,  they don t seem quite as elegant as stemware . 
otterbox ,  best protection a phone can have !  this case is much better fitting than the defender case . 
i use this as a plant stand and it looks beautiful . 
i keep it a work as a back up for when i need to charge my phone . 
when i cooked num_extend it took num_extend minutes . 
the child in me finds these noises amusing and pleasant . 
however ,  those cases can t be used with a holster ,  and they don t have a kickstand . 
it s easy to put on and take off but protects really well . 
i recently built a solar oven ,  and thought that cast iron cookware would work well in it . 
it is an absolute disaster seeing as we have no garage ,  outside storage ,  or extra closets . 
don t accept any imitations . update : a few days after submitting this review i purchased another shoe tree for my husband . 
the biochemical reactions that kill your wine are temperature sensitive . 
though i m not a huge fan of pulling the plug to turn it off ,  but it doesn t seem dangerous . 
definitely one piece of granite and very solid . 
it seemed there was good an bad wit all of the corkscrews . 
it is a quick and easy way to make a cuppa to run out the door with . 
i ve recycled the capahlon and other cooking products made from aluminum . 
the rubber  plugs  do a great job of covering both the charging port as well as the num_extend jack . 
well worth a premium over almost any other device on the market . 
i am happy with my purchase and would recommend this product . 
i did that for the hdmi adapter also . 
when i receive a cell call i go into my den and the reception is perfect . 
it was always too hot and i seemed to lack control . 
i liked using this product and the results of getting perfectly cored apple and slices . 
i do own other knives by this maker and plan to order more over time . 
i have shopped for a knife block and balked at the averaging pricing at the retail stores . 
although ,  i miss the slimness this case offered . 
i also use it to make matchstick carrots and many other uses . 
that says it all about our allegiance to chemex . 
this came as a premium with purchase ,  so i m not sure i d have selected it otherwise . 
i am a guy and num_num for what it s worth . 
the indentation in the center of the lid accepts the  stem  from the machine just perfectly . 
i needed a replacement battery for my wife s phone after the first one crapped out . 
this coat rack lasted around num_num years until one of the base legs splintered off the column . 
i have never seen a thermal coffeemaker designed for residential use with a glass liner . 
only used this once in my half size sheet pan ,  for which this is designed to fit . 
wheel is large enough to go through really thick toppings !  . 
racks have stayed in placemy kids have too many shoes . 
wish the cord was a little longer but it s much longer than the one you get with the phone . 
and ,  of course ,  these are removable so i haven t permanently damaged my cabinet wall . 
this pan is amazing !  in fact ,  everything i have owned from nordicware has been a fantastic product . 
there isn t many accessories out for the htc aria . 
i have cookware ,  utensils ,  canisters ,  you name it . 
it holds a large quantity without taking up tons of valuable fridge real estate . 
i use this for icing cakes ,  transferring cookies to a cooling rack ,  serving cake ,  brownies ,  etc . 
the installation is a little tricky but if you take your time it will come out perfect . 
when shredding lettuce ,  it shoots it out the side into a bowl . 
i am not sure if it charges any quicker ,  but charge times are considerable ,  nonetheless . 
these warmers are just like the ones used at our local restaurant for those lobster or crab entrees . 
and i love my bluetooth no problems so far . 
it make holding the iphone feel secure and comfortable . 
easy cleaningi m lazy and i never clean my microwave . 
i did and lost one after num_num years of use . 
i ve been known to leave it on for days on end and i ve had it for several months . 
my husband was pleased that it only took about twenty minutes to get it together . 
the filter basket swings open with the touch of a button ,  and can be easily removed . 
it s probably safe in the freezer ,  i think . it also is dishwasher safe . 
i put my eggs on whole wheat bread with a slice of cheese . 
it is perfect for my needs and i expect it to last a good long while . 
i have a small oven and it s hard to find a good solid roasting pan that will fit . 
for the price is really is a good deal . 
very comfortable compared to in ear devices and has very clear sound . 
make sure you use an screen protector as this only protects the back and sides of the iphone num_extend
super useful for all kinds of kitchen measuring . 
cons : volume slider will respond to hand or bare skin . 
my husband loved them so much ,  we ended up buying a second set . 
from what i ve read ,  none of the newer machines have that problem anymore . 
it s the perfect size on the countertop ,  too . now i can sleep at night . 
once i figured out this only worked with the bumper case . 
i thought it might be about time to write a review . 
use it for anything that you need to flip to the other side ,  eggs ,  pancakes ,  or whatever . 
after reading all the positive reviews i purchased this knife . 
this case will work for either num_num or num_extend model . 
can never have too many of these ,  especially when you have little ones wanting to help all the time . 
i bought this item more than num_num years ago . 
i could cover it if i needed to ,  but turning it works . 
i really did like how it looked ,  though . 
i ll see how it fares from now on . 
i love my phone ,  i would recommend to anyone . 
wish for $ it would come with a holder . 
instead of using supplied milk  bucket  i use a cleaned mott s num_extend
i purchased this parchement paper after running out of the large sheets i have been using for years . 
it has a num_num level battery indicator so you know how much its charged . 
the value depends on how much sugar you want in a container . 
my main use for these is to stream audio from my devices using the num_extend stereo bluetooth profile . 
with that said ,  there is a place for this knife in your kitchen . 
it works great in protecting the counter top from spills ,  scratches ,  and the like . 
i use it for a strainer over a large bowl . 
we bought this because our bedroom gets inexplicably hotter than the rest of the house at night . 
if you don t follow this ,  things will stick and they re hard to scrape off . 
also ,  these take a lot of room on the cupboard shelf . 
it is well made and easy to clean ,  though as the manufacturer points out it should be hand washed . 
as with all fiestaware items ,  the quality proves that the dishes should last a long time . 
good surface for reducing sauces and space enough for two servings . 
i bought this last winter and it works great . 
coffee under the counter maker is sitting idle . 
for the price ,  this is a great chopper . 
you can buy an inexpensive converter to plug in headphones ,  but it s weird they didn t include that . 
it s so easy to use and kind of fun . 
negative reviews are just using it in unusual or extreme circumstances . 
the phone is big enough as it is . 
a very simple in design that s easy to use . 
really cheap so why not pick up a couple of them !  . 
i needed a filler item and purchased these . 
i like it ,  and am not disappointed ,  but boy is it slippery in the hands . 
it s obvious you ll need this along with the grinder attachment if you want to make homemade sausages . 
i use it more as a ladle than a spoon . 
if the hook went the other way it would make it much easier to hook on to the rod . 
i bought this knife to slice my homemade bread and it works just as i intended it to . 
get the concentrators and enjoy every piece of corn . 
if my phone  sony ericsson num_extend is more than an arm s length away ,  i hear a crackling noise . 
i bought this presto electric percolator after a num_num month search for the perfect cup of coffee . 
they doubled my phone life and extended my wife s at least four hours . 
it is kind of dark red in color . 
bialetti s strong points are price ,  practicality and durability . 
this french press shows the same high quality of all bodum products . 
my water tastes cleaner and there is no odor . 
we recently ditched our old vintage white chipped china for new fiestaware in sunflower . 
they arrived in great condition ,  and in a timely manner . 
if i had to choose ,  i d definitely go with the steinheil . 
i am amazed that there are not more choices for a product so many people choose to own . 
i can hear every call just fine ,  they can all hear me . 
it can take the heat and washes clean . 
my husband said they were easy to put together . 
finally i gave in this year and bought one . 
use to use a juice reamer before but this really does the job . 
then you can also use it by itself to present fruits or vegetables ,  at dinner parties and such . 
i use this big bowl at least once a week . 
this beater fits the stand and works just like the original did when it was new . 
place in a pot just large enough to hold the eggs without crowding ,  and just cover with water . 
no more wondering if i can make it through the run without charging my headset !   :   . 
i just wipe the crumbs and spills off of it and place it back for the next use . 
i m really surprised to see all of the negative reviews regarding the durability of these glasses . 
although there were  grill  marks on the burgers ,  it took a while before that appeared . 
  tasteless  is a good term .   there is no chlorine or any other taste with this filter . 
herramienta necesaria para cambiar los tamanios de las sims y poder usarlos en los distintos modelos de iphone . 
this car charger is a nice addition for my car . 
i remember growing up hearing my mother talk about how badly she wanted a kitchenaid . 
but anyways that was my fault for following that review . 
i am glad i didn t go with a more expensive model . 
there was a little bubble in the paint but nothing anyone could point out !  we are very happy . 
this is perfect and it s small enough to hide in laundry room . 
the lids work great for what they were designed for ,  so i can t fault them for that . 
i really like my salad washed well and spun dry and that s exactly what this does . 
unlike most people on here ,  my sinus problems arise in the spring and summer . 
one for fresh water with shampoo and the other with dirty water . 
cheapest i ve seen actual brita filters anywhere rather it be online or in a store . 
the machine is easy to operate ,  and not as confusing as you first think when you open the box . 
if you travel and use both lightning and micro usb devices ,  this is the coolest thing ever . 
due to its small size ,  special care will be required not to lose it !  . 
that being said ,  the bread comes out nice ,  but the settings are a little tricky . 
i often felt the need to clean out the tower of the mr . 
the thin plastic hinge ,  hopefully will have a long life . 
means serious business when it comes to cleaning . 
consider that in my opinion if you like . the bacon rack ,  though perhaps a bit small ,  work great . 
i found this nissan unit just a few oz . 
this looks really good in person ,  much better than in the picture . 
we have used this on both homemade pizza ,  bread sticks and it cuts like butter . 
this is cool since many of my coworkers are also facebook friends . 
all components are packaged nicely in a box and come with instructions how to froth milk . 
little longer than normal shipping but it is coming from overseas . 
they do the job exactly as you would hope them to . 
we received this juicer about two weeks ago and have used it several times now . 
having ordered ,  received ,  and used this set myself ,  i strongly agree with them . 
the cord is a normal length and can be placed out the back or the side . 
the bits always seem to escape the tea ball ,  and the mesh squeezey thing which works better is num_extend
it s kind of a bummer that you have to buy special filters ,  but they really do make the difference . 
at any rate ,  i do recommend this fan as a good value for the price . 
it is not bad for the money and compare to the dr . 
it fits my mason jars ,  i am using to store loose tea . 
that s why i am only giving them four stars . 
no more overcooked coffee if not drunk right away . 
it s also simple to use .  .  . lift the top with the handle ,  put your jar in and push the top down . 
these aren t fancy ,  but they re not ugly either . 
i got this set on a gold box special for under $
so ,  this a great choice for someone who wants to perfect all the details . 
this is the perfect size for frothing milk . 
but i guess the weight is proportion to the charging capacity . 
good quality for outdoor use ,  would look great indoors too . 
i use it mostly to cut onions and for a while began to consider it a necessity . 
there was also two places with some dust specks under the film . 
would recommend it for those needing a car charger for their iphone . 
people on the other end can hear me clearly ,  and i can hear them perfectly . 
the wand telescopes long enough to avoid back strain . 
it does struggle  slow down  sometimes with larger or heavy dough . 
so i swallowed my masculine pride and ordered it . 
the clip is large and plastic ,  it accommodates a very large belt and is relatively flexible . 
i used a flat head screw driver and things tightened up great . 
especially good for breakfast as well as for snacking and tv meals . 
i use my phone a lot ,  and when i am out at events it seems to die rather fast . 
i couldn t find a personal coffeemaker anywhere in my local area . 
i expect liquid will pool a bit around the edges . 
i use the small num_extend pans to bake cakes ,  pies and pot pies . 
i am going to buy one for each room . 
this one is so much easier to manage . it is also beautiful . 
it is easy to turn the handle to cut the can . 
i bought two of these ,  one for each of the two body pillows in my home . 
eventually ,  he will have a great all clad colection of cookware . 
it s easy to clean and the presentation is really nice . 
i read many comments and decided to buy this item with a dimmer switch ,  as many of you suggested . 
so it was crucial for me to protect my new num_extend this time around . 
salad spinners are one of the most used kitchen utensils that we have . 
it comes with num_num hooks and you can easy hang it over the door . 
i may try others but really satisfied with these . 
we do low carb so i can make a cheese cake without a crust and it is perfect . 
it s the perfect size for my husband and me . 
it works fine ,  has a long handle ,  and is easy to clean . 
they re also more sturdy and don t rip when i m removing the used filters and grounds . 
i have had my kitchenaid pro num_num mixer for about a month . 
a good sized four slice toaster ,  wide enough for bagels or texas toast . 
this one makes a difference in my apartment s air quality while generating noise that helps me sleep at night . 
buy yourself one of those $ electric ones . 
my first one ,  which was over num_num years old ,  finally rusted around the bottom . 
static no longer a problem after learning what to do . 
another great feature is the two available levels of pressure . 
the black granite ware is very attractive and i look forward to many years of canning with this canner . 
i only wish there where more colors available at the time i purchased . 
she loves it . i have to admit we never use the stopwatch and rarely use the clock . 
overall i am happy with the pillow; it was actually a solution for a good night sleep . 
the drip guard and exterior plastic are % easy to clean . 
the ones i ve tried to purchase in the stores are either too long ,  wide or both . 
we like the little handle on the side of the egg basket ,  sturdiest one we ever had . 
this was the last chance i gave to myself for my bread making  career  . 
there are num_num actual usable slots available on the block . 
this one is capable of pairing with multiple devices . 
overall though ,  i found this to be a perfect protector of my phone . 
they may have gone up even more since i ve been typing this review . 
no more plastic basters for me !  this does not rust and is dishwasher safe . 
it sure lives up to the hype .  . it keeps my phone constantly charged up when needed . 
plus my favorite color is red and they made it in red but hey have other colors as well . 
i can t begin to tell you how much time this has saved me . 
then there were slight scratches on the rubber like it was scraped . 
it supplies num_extend that the icarrier num_extend needs to charge . 
it s the bomb !  get it ,  use it ,  wonder how you lived without it . 
it s also lightweight ,  portable ,  and reliable for my charging needs . 
it covered my iphone very well and it doesn t hold smudges . 
not much to say here ,  except that it performs as promised . 
and i have this one for juicing my leafy greens . 
for a little vac ,  this works good cause of the brushes . 
i haven t seen any  ski gloves for iphone  yet . 
the suction device that keeps it pinned to my  slick ,  granite  counter top works perfectly . 
whites do ooze out from bottem a little whether cooking in nonstick skillet or frying pan with oil . 
i been buying skinomi screen potectors since my first smart phone . 
at this price ,  this is a must have !  !  !  !  . 
it has done everything that i have tried to do so far . 
wanted to try this belkin unit at $ cheaper than the griffin . 
down side is that it is really small canister so you dump it after every room . 
this cutter is moderately sized  think of where you are going to store it  and precise as can be . 
a lot of canisters only give you three ,  and at a much higher price . 
it will give you a couple of hours of additional time . 
i put a sticker on my dashboard to use it and it holds the phone very nicely . 
received it very quickly and they feel very comfortable in the ear . 
lodge does not seem to make a glass lid for their num_extend cast iron pan . 
it was quite affordable ,  and i am very happy with the purchase . 
the machine is much heavier than their older models .  .  . probably to to a larger motor . 
before i would spray the trays ,  the meat stuck horribly . 
so far ,  i ve made it to the six month point . 
these are all purpose kitchen shears and i can t think of any improvements . 
i had purchased these mats hoping they d save me turning on the heat so often . 
it s not a device you can use right before work . 
it s the best cutting board on the market and will last generations if properly taken care of . 
we have used this in the oven ,  microwave safe ,  freezer ,  and dishwasher . 
i havent found a better bluetooth headset for the price . 
seem to be a strong case and doesn t scratch too easy . 
however after recieving these today ,  i am blown away . 
i ve used it a few times and i love it . 
she expressed she was really happy with it . 
it certainly lasts ,  and chops food really well . 
this set is oven ,  microwave ,  refrigerator ,  dishwasher ,  and freezer safe . 
i have had very good luck with all the victorinox products . 
almost magic ,  being able to carry extra power around . 
i ve had my set for over a year and they seem as new as the day they arrived . 
of course i am clumsy though so i do it over a stable surface . 
in the mean time i have connected it to my droid to see if it works and it does . 
these oil rubbed bronze rollers are exactly what you need to hold your shower curtains on the shower rod . 
a tsp and a half ,  and the large one tablespoonfull .  . for cookies those are the size i want . 
i have had the phone for two weeks now and i have been very pleased . 
this is lightweight which i like and boils water faster than any pot i own . 
the blueant num_extend is everything it claims to be . 
simply plug the plastic top into your num_extend headset jack until you need it . 
do not press to hard as you can break the egg but its easy to clean . 
the slots are large enough to handle large bagels . 
this product will get hand down through generations for sure . 
it came in within a couple of days ,  item is as described ,  good quality at such an affordable price . 
i remembered the article in the magazine ,  and found the same product on amazon . com . 
it is slim and light and easily fits in your pockets . 
only have had it for about a week ,  but so far so good . 
it works well and i would recommend it . 
i season it with a light coat of olive oil and let it sit for a bit . 
it s slightly worse than my bluetooth headset ,  which doesn t suck . 
this hand mixer is the third of its kind i ve owned . 
the magnets are pretty strong ,  and the earbuds have yet to bounce themselves loose . 
i watched a store owner at a cell accessory shop put one on . 
using blade cut and slash resistant cloves really helps . 
this accomplishes the job of floor cleaning in quick order . 
i m no pro on coffee ,  but i know what i like . 
just wish i could get a lid for it to keep grease in . 
but what surprised and delighted me most was the weight which is neither heavy nor featherweight . 
even without the lid ,  which i prompt lost ,  it works great . 
this shower basket looks good ,  and it stays adhered to the shower wall . 
it should be coated ,  but not overly shiny and definitely not dripping . 
bought these for the wife to replace the standard headphones that come with iphone . 
as a pasta maker ,  i would have to give it only num_num star . 
they go from fridge to freezer to over ,  to microwave . 
strange how much better this conical burr grinder works than my old regular one . 
it is heavy duty and tricky to store in our small kitchen . glad i have it though . 
he s able to fit his phone ,  id and credit card all in the armband comfortably . 
i bought all three sizes of the oxo good grips tongs . 
theses steak knives are heavy ,  cut well ,  and are beautiful . 
if you aren t used to sharp knives ,  don t start with this one . 
you definitely need this with the brabantia covers and boards . 
cookies come off it really nicely ,  no fighting between the stuck cookie and the spatula . 
another piece that i purchased as a christmas gift for my daughter in law s collection . 
in addition ,  some of the items will come in handy for your other electronics . 
she was so excited to get this years additions and will be anxious to try everything . 
the only thing i don t like about these cups is they don t nest very well . 
not only has this piece performed flawlessly ,  but the entire set i received has too . 
a bit heavy but it beats teflon pans ,  health wise . 
i looked at several types at local stores ,  but didn t find anything i liked . 
we made ice cream cones for our house party and everyone was delighted . 
if it had been as good and cordless ,  i would have given it five stars . 
this usually stinks out our apartment for a week ,  and it still did . 
granted ,  it is not an apple product ,  but is does work . 
i regularly wear mine all day without a problem . 
see my frieling french press review on the good stuff ,  thegoodstuffreviews . blogspot . comi hope this was helpful to you . 
really liked the design and quality of the sleeve . 
really easy to apply and its been a couple months and it still looks good . 
i used this for apples and found that it works well on totally round apples with a flat bottom . 
i always wondered what the big fuss was about .  .  .  . well ,  now i get it . 
but the meat and hamburger taste very good . 
works well and i have num_num devices paired to it . 
you will wish all of those things came in a can . 
you simply drag your knife several times through the shaping slots ,  rotating back and forth between the two . 
i only got rid of it because i upgraded to the iphone num_num recently . 
the skin fits nicely and has a good feel to it . 
it does do the job fine but not as easily as i thought which is my fault . 
i plan on using this often to make healthy sulfite free snacks and ingredients for my baking . 
this speaker does get pretty loud but it is not fill the whole room up with sound loud . 
overall ,  the quality is great and the price as well . 
safety feature :  grinder will not operate unless hopper and lid are in place . 
i have an old cotton dinner napkin that i keep specifically for this purpose . 
we love this coffee !  my dad is an espresso aficionado and this is the only one he drinks now . 
i have had no such issues ,  although it does take a few times to get used to the case . 
again ,  just being honest but the name  acase  screams cheap asian junk . 
we re still using the original ones from when we first got it . 
no need to bother data plan . i am currently owning garmin num_extend tomtom num_extend and megellan num_extend
i have yet to use these and therefore cannot fully rate . 
strainer option is very nice for small particles . 
nothing super special but definitely better than the disposable shakers i was using from walmart  :   . 
well there s not much you can say about a melon baller . 
i needed both hands to lift the pan . 
all of that aside ,  it does do what it claims so i will rate the product itself num_num stars . 
so now i have to be mindful of where they go so i don t cause more rust . 
for the money i think this skillet gives a lot in return . 
it has steady heat properties that make it a staple in the kitchens of those that love to cook . 
i can answer a call from both phones at once ,  it is great . 
terrific board and just my size for my rv home . 
the other four are the newer models that will charge from any usb port . 
this new battery i bought has lasted years !  it s great !  . 
had it not been under warranty the cost to me would be $
the camera ,  as others have noted ,  is not great . 
to my surprise it worked even though by the rulebook ,  it should not have . 
edit :  i also have used this with a num_extend num_extend antenna  requires a male fme to male sma adapter  . 
historically ,  dustbusters have been anemic when it comes to suction . 
soft and still able to access your phone !  . 
i love it !  it makes the nicest little bundt cakes . 
not so with a heavy cast iron pan . 
and this way is every bit as quick as packaged food but so much healthier . 
i found it invaluable during air travel ,  working in remote offices ,  etc . 
especially if you have a round bottom wok . 
the only downside i see at the present time is that i eat twice as much popcorn now !  . 
it feels solid when contacting the surface of the ipad . 
my phone has survived several drops with these cases . 
with the right kind of care it should last for years . 
oh ,  they re also heavy enough where they don t spin around on the stove top . 
this is the second pack of twelve we got . 
we had a less expensive zester that worked poorly and took forever ,  even for lemons . 
it is a little thick to use with a cover such as an otter box . 
this little personal hot water maker is just what i tea drinker like me needed . 
scalloped potatoes bake up wrapped in crusty goodness . 
i bought this after my husband and i decided to start making our own pasta . 
i haven t had them long enough to comment on their durability but overall they appear to be high quality . 
there s just some slight differences on the sides and the front . 
i was torn between buying an air popper and this item , i just love this item . 
press the button the back of the device ,  search usb devices on your phone ,  and it will pair . 
but these pressure cookers are really good ,  you can cook some really healthy food quickly in them . 
that s an amazing help !  just good old fashioned american product that i ve used now for num_num years . 
the towel doesn t slide as naturally on skin ,  compared to cotton . 
this is by far one of my favorite products ever . 
first ,  there is a basic recipe on the board for plain pastry . 
it s easy to pair and the sound quality is fantastic . 
this stylus works great on my iphone num_extend and my num_extend
everyone i talked to said the sound quality was great . overall ,  i love my jabra . 
it covers the screen perfectly from edge to edge and top to bottom with no overhang . 
i only found two or three models with that ,  and this was one . 
most of the time i am just using it to hook up to a computer to charge . 
the cord retractor doesn t work well ,  but i just wind the cord around the body . 
it is very light ,  portable and has excellent battery life . 
so far i m very pleased with this purchase . 
the gaba setting takes num_extend hours but it s easy to plan ahead . 
that pitcher was terrible ,  and i finally bought a replacement . 
and since it is plastic ,  there s no worry of scratching the pan . 
s s s s ss s s s s s s . 
i bought this with a new chassis bezel for my ipod touch after i broke the glass . 
i am so glad that i messed up and ordered these . 
i made sure to normalize the temperature and apply it in room temperature conditions . 
nothing seems to be clear on that ,  i do and no complains . 
i cut kirkland signature bacon in half and this tray accommodates four strips . 
in response to an email ,  presto was fast to suggest its return ,  but i never got around to it . 
i like that it covers more of the front of the phone . 
i use this now to monitor any single device on demand when i need to . 
i worked at a pizza place for a few years and i wish they had cutters this nice . 
still ,  it s easier than sorting through a bunch of cold packages to find what i m looking for . 
my husband bought and installed a replacement switch and the slicer works . 
if you drink it black with a little sugar ,  the flavor is wonderfully robust . 
i like that this pillow is very long ,  considering that i am num_extend myself . 
i returned it the first day and was not worth even $
i actually wound up buying these for myself after using them at a friends house . 
but the pump does take about num_num minutes to inflate ,  and since this mattress is huge ,  that s pretty impressive . 
the iphone can t have a case on it though . 
first is sound quality ,  the sound is clear and decent highs just not enough bass for me . 
it never sticks ,  no rust and used daily . 
as the coats are very heavy ,  i am very pleased to have them hanging on the wooden pole . 
it s iridescent and changes color when viewed from different angles . 
i was really intrigued by the myheadset software for my android cell phone . 
using the headset is very easy as well . 
the finished seasoning is a lot better than i ever obtained in a oven . 
this is a classy addition to your table at tea . 
for its sole purpose of existence ,  i give it num_num stars . 
will go plenty loud if you need it to . 
i have not used yet but this is the second type like this i had . 
this sharpening steel works very well and is a great deal for the price . 
don t think that it s only for pastry though !  i use it all the time when cutting up veggies ,  etc . 
to that i just have to say :  i could also make a fire with two sticks ,  but why ?  ?  ?  . 
if you re new to plantronics ,  i would suggest giving them a try . 
the voice commands work reasonably well on our android phones which are num_num htc thunderbolts and a moto droid . 
the case arrived pretty fast and was easy to get onto the iphone . 
it is just the right size that i needed for my bathroom . 
yet ,  the motor kneaded this for num_num minutes without a complaint . 
snaps easily to the back of the phone . 
it s well constructed; i m expecting it to last for many ,  many years . 
i bought num_num of these for all the new phones in the family upgrade . 
i m impressed with this exceptional support and service and have upgraded my rating . 
easy to program .  .  . holds num_num cups .  .  .  . pot easy to pour but if our happiness changes ,  we will update this review . 
so ,  it s really not that  much  juice inside it . 
the cleaner works like a charm ,  so it is easy to clean and it stores in the press . 
they were all in one simple clear package   not packaged individually   . 
this item works very well for my cell phone and blue tooth . 
i purchased this bissel quicksteamer about six weeks ago . 
she says it s easy to use and brews the coffee perfectly each time . 
i m one of those ppl that must have the newest phones ,  electronics ,  kitchen gadgets ,  etc . 
the hole in the center for the drain is a bit smaller too but still ok . 
it arrived today ,  num_num august !  !  it was supposed to be a birthday gift on num_num july . 
in use now for over num_num months ,  this productdoes a great job . 
but ,  with that ,  it is great ,  i care about over use of paper products . 
and this one was exactly like the one i had to part ways with . 
when i saw this product i first did a little dance ,  then measured to see if it would fit . 
these are the only photo albums that i use . 
this is a good price for a nice set of everyday glasses . 
the description says stainless steel but i guess that doesn t include the inside . 
phone case felt a little slippery at first ,  but got used t it . 
these are very well made heavy duty stainless steel spoons and should last a life time . 
the chord could be longer ,  but if you don t need that much length ,  it works great . 
i wish these trays didn t have a hole so it was easier to spread the fruit around . 
i could recommended it for ease of use and comfort ,  but the call quality is the true selling point . 
desperate for a longer battery life i searched amazon for a better battery . 
i do wish i could figure out how to get the upper chamber to drain a bit faster . 
this case is adorable !  it attracts a lot of attention . 
overall build quality is very high and it seems extremely durable . 
to my surprise it was stuck ,  and when it finally opened there was a lot of pressure release . 
the people at catskill customer service are great and work with you to fix any problem . 
i think it should be sold somewhere around num_num bucks . 
needed it for a set of speakers that had a bigger num_extend mm headphone jack . 
good for a commute to work on public transportation ,  except for the ghastly blinking light . 
glass is easy to clean ,  lids go on easily and are also easy to clean . 
the soft grip is very helpful in avoiding discomfort ,  fatigue ,  and pain . 
it is easy to use whether with frozen bread or with regular fresh bread to make toast . 
it bakes up wonderfully and the ricotta sets up well . 
it has a cord ,  so it has plenty of power . 
i want one myself now ,  for chopping sauteed veggie additives ,  such as onion ,  celery ,  etc . 
most every chef will tell you that the most important tool in the kitchen is a good knife . 
oxo always has quality products at a decent price ,  and this is no exception . 
i ruined the pair that came with my knife set . 
this will not crack and will survive a fall well . 
the handles do get hot !  !  it works well and serves it purpose . 
when you need a charge .  .  . drop the bold into the dock and forget about it . 
the time will be shorter in hot conditions and much shorter in direct sun . 
i would recommend this seller again ,  it came in an original plastic sleeve and in a timely manor . 
this was ordered for my son ,  so not being used personally . 
now i can plan all sorts of dinners !  . 
eureka !  !  i had a waffle !  what is the secret other than time ?  well i called on pam . 
i have several recipes that only taste good if i cook them in this dish . 
now i cant lay down with it on my head cause that hurts . 
the glass is thick and the handle is strong . 
the bottom line is that it works well . 
a must have if you ever crack your iphone screen . 
the icarrier did a great job charging my ipad . 
our last cooker had to be replaced because one of the handles broke . 
ola !  do not allow el queso  cheese  or meat or salsa to touch the edges . 
plug and play !  i just got this ,  and so far it;s great !  easy to install ,  easy to use . 
i used it to clean up some roasts and it worked just fine . 
they have a soft bottom and have not scratched any of our wood or glass . 
headset also paired with those easily the first time . 
to mute ,  simply hold one of the volume buttons until the unit beeps . 
if you have ever broken a juice press and crushed your fingers in the process ,  you need this . 
the thermometer gives a read in num_num seconds or less ,  and is easy to clean . 
like having a back up as my son loses things like this . 
it is accurate and lets you know when the temp . 
no more messing around with the headset whilst driving . 
it has a tight fit and keeps the slim lines of the phone . 
verizon offers very helpful blackberry workshops ,  which are more useful than the documentation that comes with their phones . 
while they aren t sharp ,  i still wouldn t stick my fingers inside . 
thats even betterlets put it this way it is the first product from korea ,  i am impressd . 
love the size and the way these bake small tea loaves and mini breads . 
i bought these to use in making nut and rice milks and so far so good . 
i have baked several caseroles and deserts in these with perfect results . 
suffice to say i am very disappointed ,  feel as if i bought a very expensive bowl with no cover . 
my wife uses this constantly  daily  as a working mother . 
we ve used it in a pinch to hold baby bibs on  the velcro goes fast  . 
this case is a very fits my evo with the extended battery very nicely . 
if you like rice you ll love it more when you use a rice cooker to make it . 
now in nyc ,  everything is expensive ,  and servants are for millionaires ,  as there is a minimum wage law . 
my family loves rice ,  but i have disappointed them many a time . 
so i bought all my girls one .  .  . love it . 
the base says  sterilite  though . it is serviceable if the dessert isn t super heavy . 
for smaller ears it does not feel very secure  but does not fall off easily  . 
easy to see red light means charging and blue light means fully charged . 
althought this is advertised as a  leakproof  springform pan ,  i put water in it and it did leak . 
turn it off when you use your normal cell ,  and on when you want to use the bluetooth . 
i like these since they are a bit thinner than my former silicone sheets . 
they are a good purchase and a useful tool . 
my mother in law died num_num years ago . 
i don t know if it actually does anything ,  but when i use it ,  i feel safer . 
this is a nice plain case that does the trick . 
its the best brand around !  i am loving my measuring cup !  hope this helps . 
the old tools i had were stripping the tiny screw heads . 
i love to cook so why that is ,  i do not know . 
it is also very heavy ,  so it pretty much stays put in one spot on the counter . 
fit my rezound which was what i was hoping for . 
these dishes are easy ,  sturdy and light weight . 
bought these because i needed my own set for school . 
i love this oxo grip whisk  . the handle is perfect for my older hands . 
i would recommend it if size isn t an issue . 
i think for the price it was a great investment . 
it does a good job of steaming potatoes and raw vegies well and it s so easy to clean . 
only thing is it is a dirt and lint magnet ,  but that is ok better than a broken evo . 
i m not sure why but the coffee really is better tasting . 
the product arrived within num_num days and it is in perfect condition ,  just how it looks on the website . 
nothing out of the ordinary and it does the job . 
the attachments are very well made ,  fit perfectly and are easy to use . 
i have one next to my bed ,  one on my desk at work and one in my car . 
it s easy to use ,  easy to clean and the results are good . 
this wilson ibooster will also charged your iphone . 
also ,  i have only handwashed these as instructed ,  but the finish doesn t last so long . 
i m incredibly impressed with the product and i hope their other products have just as good quality . 
the grip is just right and all the buttons are covered and protected from dust . 
when it arrived i washed it with mild soap and water . 
this power pack came in handy many times my phone about to run out of power . 
i will recommend these to other people and i will be buying more for my next iphone num_num repair . 
it s heavy ,  noisy and all the things people say ,  almost too heavy for an old woman . 
it is a learning process but i am looking forward to canning other meals to have in the cupboard . 
it was too firm for her ,  so i used it myself . 
they are very close but just won t shave . 
it s dishwasher safe ,  it doesn t melt or smell bad when heated and it s really easy to clean . 
this s ii brings a lot of joy to its user too . 
i use these pyrex rectangular storage containers mainly for meat dishes . 
i usually forget that i m wearing them even after having them on for a few hours ,  they re that soft . 
it cleaned up really easy and it worked great . 
can t beat the price ,  and it works great with the xoom . 
i can not get enough heat under it with my largest kitchen stove burner . 
this is to protect your iphone from scratches only . 
it advertises num_num hours talk ,  and num_num months standby . 
i feel like i could break it if it was bent to hard . 
i recommend using coconut oil with this for best flavor that s also healthier than butter . 
i haven t had a problem with it and works great with my phone . 
i received them a few days earlier than expected and hurried and applied . 
it just takes a bit of getting used to . 
they come from england and each toaster is hand built by the same person from start to finish . 
i attached the num_extend with an adaptor i bought at the same time . 
additionally they have level tops and handles so that you can easily level off the top of your scoop . 
he has enjoyed his complete set but this skillet he uses the most . 
i would suggest finding someone with steady hands to get this thing on . 
had i not encountered difficulty ,  i would have been able to place the second order and saved $
the sound is good and not so loud that it will bust your eardrums . 
we got my dad a kitchenaid mixer num_num series in nickel for his birthday . 
i have this utensil for num_num years and it still looks like new . 
a blender is really better suited for liquid itemsclean up is a cinch . 
this is perfect for single batches or small batches only . 
the bowl has to be frozen for about several hours before using . 
everything about this coffee making is great and user friendly . 
i am on an eternal quest for a bluetooth earpiece that will work in a convertible . 
it cleans the carpets very nicely and cleans up easily afterwards . 
since it senses steam to determine that the food is reheated ,  that function will always boil liquids . 
to use the slots from both sides ,  check the rotation arc before installing . 
makes the use of the jar for storage safer and more effective . 
it could easily be the only chef s knife that you need . 
this took maybe num_num minutes to put together . 
the ac adapter works in num_extend ac and num_extend ac outlets . 
price ,  num_num pounds of premium sushi grade rice cost num_num bux in asian supermarket . 
i ve got weak hands and hate slicing a roast or carving a turkey . 
it is the second one we have purchased made by wisconsin aluminum foundry in manitowoc ,  wi . 
these scoops are some of my favorite little kitchen tools . 
some pictures make it look black ,  but it is actually a deep metallic pewter color . 
these will come in handy for dehydrating around this prepper s house . 
the calphalon pans remind me of cast iron ,  which i like to cook in . 
it charges fast and it actually works pretty well for my kindle fire hd . 
this is my first pressure cooker and i really like it . 
needed a fry pan for an egg or two and this fits the bill nicely . 
it is a little large but for what i needed it for it works great . 
my husband looked at it and reassembled it for me . 
however ,  know that this is not water proof . 
this thermos does exactly what i want a thermos to do . 
i ve made cream of carrot soup with it ,  frostings ,  pudding ,  mashed potatoes ,  salsa and salad dressings . 
unfortunately ,  it got left behind when i left an ugly relationship . 
dre ,  there s no comparison when matched up to the embrace . 
i ve had this press for about a year now ,  and i am still in love with it . 
we went through two cheaper juice presses from a chain home furnishings store . 
used it to charge a friend s phone and they decided to get one for themselves . 
it has been an easy to operate phone . 
with material this cheap you won t take it apart anyway just like with ikea furniture lol . 
there is no way i m picking this up to pour off bacon grease . 
but i would not buy any other kind . 
do not store it full of air as it may cause clogging . 
i was ok but not the best in the world . 
this is a great replacement for my body glove case . 
again ,  purely cosmetic . now ,  about the mixer : it is absolutely amazing . 
it has a sleek black design ,  and i love it way more than the crappy thermal braun machines . 
keeps everything in order in my car and it doesn t get all tangled . 
convenient holder keeps the frother off the counter surface so the stem doesn t get bent . 
we set the stop watch on my phone while watching tv . 
helped us with our organization quite a bit . 
it makes a good basic phone for making and receiving calls . 
i bought this over a year ago and i still love it . 
it will burn if you accidentally lay it too close to the fire . 
it took just minutes to line the drawer ,  set the holders in put all the in place . 
i ve long preferred the taste of french press coffee to that produced by drip machines . 
i can speak only well of this wonderful device . 
it s not supposed to be opened wider than num_extend which is a very narrow opening . 
they make a couple of different styles these days that they didn t have the last time around . 
britta water replacement filter it works great no complaints i would recommend this to family or friends . 
i doubt most people would even notice it . 
i have several of these and use them to make cookies all the time . 
the sound quality is good to very good . 
henckels num_extend fine edge paring knife for num_num months . 
yeah they are expensive but will last forever . 
super easy to hold ,  good grip ,  comfy and sharp blade . 
the device still would not charge even on this cable . 
i no longer even take a laptop away from home . 
i have tried different types of stands but nothing is as convenient as this one . 
you can expect liquid to leak out the bottom if liquid exceeds this line . 
the new one is definitely thinner and lighter than the older made pan . 
hardly any kernels end up in your bowl because they stay behind in the popper  like most air poppers  . 
who would have thought a mixer could be ,  so sexy . 
i purchased this for my dad for fathers day . 
i also purchased their  office adapter kit  which came with a suction cup antenna mount and num_extend charger . 
i received this skillet on time and the cost was very reasonable . 
i ve made lots of noodles ,  and bunches of ravioli . 
i ignored her request and shopped around and found this percolator highly recommended ,  so i bought one . 
unlike another reviewer ,  i wouldn t say that it fits a num_extend pan  perfectly  . 
again ,  though ,  i had no luck slicing anything thinly with this knife . 
so i told him a little white lie about how much it cost ,  they re living on a fixed income  . 
pops great and doesn t seem to get as messy from the oil as the previous one . 
however ,  i don t think it s as strong as cast iron . 
it indeed is as sharp as everyone says it is . 
it has added more verstility to my processor and it gets used a lot . 
replaced for the exact same coffee maker that was probably ten years old . 
this is the num_extend case that i have bought for my iphone . 
i love this case !  my phone bounced whenever it hit the floor ,  no dings or scratches or cracks . 
this soft silicon gel protector is the best . 
sturdy and well made ,  it fits snugly and provides real protection from drops and scratches . 
i don t write too many reviews but felt compelled to write this one because this case is so good . 
the mid size  sandwich  knife is very good for trimming soft meats . 
this is my first calphalon purchase and i have come back for more . 
to add to that were two tiny screw drivers . 
well ,  i will admit there weren t any fireworks bursting out of the box when i opened it . 
tenderized meat that had been frozen too long quite well . 
yes ,  it s pricey ,  but you ll truly get something that you ll use all the time . 
long probe to penetrate deep in the meat . 
this time around ,  i wanted a metal spoon that would live through every kind of accident . 
wait a second !  i only just purchased this thing . 
if you make your own rolls ,  num_num fit the pan perfectly . 
it has a sturdy ,  strong magnet ,  and it is a nice size . 
plus ,  my wife is nervous about  chemicals  leaching into our food . 
any kind of thick sauce or base requiring whisking is what this pan was designed for . 
i find it less expensive and easier to use cheesecloth . 
now she has a spare ! i can tell from her instagram selfies that she carries this case frequently . 
this case is much less bulky than the two piece versions that click together and are mostly gaudy . 
with the jawbone num_extend you could just press the primary button to access voice dialing . 
it is also easy to clean and attractive if you think stainless steel is attractive . 
i couldn t be more pleased with this wall rack . 
adds a bright ,  reflective spot to your kitchen . 
i m also glad to see that the inside antenna can be upgraded without having to buy a new amplifier . 
i haven t used it yet ,  but i ve ordered one before ,  and it worked great . 
i use on my phone and my tablet . 
i really like having this little power pack as a back up ,  it has certainly come in handy . 
it is a type of fat italian pasta . 
previously i didn t have much use for siri ,  now i m using it all the time . 
i have dropped my phone on the street a few times and my phone still works perfectly . 
it has a variable darkness knob ,  which is a fine feature . 
we as a family have gotten alot of us out of this set and i would definitely recommend it . 
after seasoning ,  do not use soap again . seasoning the wok was very simple . 
it does the job right ,  hollers when it s done . 
i have fibromyalgia and it was almost impossible to juice fruit manually . 
the  white  noise actually does help me sleep . 
it does not take up too much room and it is very nice looking . 
it is smaller than i had imagined but is the size it said it would be . 
you can t get this quality for this price anywhere else . 
its great for business use ,  meetings and more . 
if it were a couple of inches longer it would be perfect . 
not now !  just slide the mitt on the handle and it never gets hot . 
so i had to put it on the left passenger vent . 
these are supposed to be the best and work very well for me . 
the lack of buttons is also a plus come cleanup time . 
there is a difference in the cheap copies and these . 
once i bought my first flexible stainless spatula i literally threw all my other spatulas out . 
very nice having the correct tools for the job at hand . 
these are exactly what i wanted !  they are very sturdy and work well . 
but keeping your knives sharp can be a challenge . 
this does not require much effort other than common sense . 
so i got granpappy . i have to say i love it . 
just pump it up when needed and the spray is nice and fine . 
i will recommend these as being a very worthwhile purchase and i d happily buy them again !  . 
my wife and i are starting our num_extend set of dishes in num_num years of marriage . 
this num_num qt mixing pitcher with lid is a very handy item indeed . 
great condition ,  reflective surface for night running and not too tight !  worth the money !  !  . 
this product was easy to use out of the box . 
it is pretty sturdy too .  .  . but don t use in the dishwasher . 
the stainless steel is nice and i think will wear well over time . 
i like the fresh taste of this popper . 
lightweight and the inside is roomy for ear buds or a bt headset . 
also like that there s a basic recipe on the wrapper . 
 :  the measuring cups are durable ,  accurate ,  and attractive . 
so far ,  i m liking my norpro stainless citrus juice press . 
i bought this to charge my transformer in the vehicle . 
the cruiser finally ran out of juice after num_num full charges on three different electronic devices . 
needed more batteries for phone ,  due to heavy usage for phone and data . 
so far these products have worked flawlessly for me . 
nuke the bacon  turkey  and your are good for the morning . 
i received these pans yesterday and used them today . 
well ,  this is something you really don t need and it is a pure fun item to have . 
pairing was a snap ,  super easy ,  turn them both on set search and done . 
they are fabulous !  !  !  i do a lot of homemade cooking . 
made of rubber so it bends just in the right spots . 
now this is with very light use ,  but even so i can already tell there s a huge difference . 
the sound on the mac was rougher to the point of sounding like fm radio in quality vs . 
the grip is rubberized and fits my smaller hands well . 
was concerned that handle might not be strongenough ,  but it is very sturdy . 
it changes your life if you ve never used one before . 
this one is sturdy and gets the job done well . 
plan on using this a lot within warranty time to make sure there are no problems after first use . 
the tiny size and many different ear options are especially nice . 
it also feels good when i hold the phone . 
however ,  a larger one is good to have on hand for when you have company over . 
if you re still thinking about buying this item ,  trust me ,  do it already . 
it appears i don t need it now on the replacement pot i bought ,  oh well . 
consequently a lot of hair can t be cleaned out after use . 
i get so many compliments on this case . 
my sedio is great but ladder work will unholster it so i got this case . 
i know it sounds crazy to wax poetic over a popcorn maker ,  but this one deserves it . 
it does a good job on a nice firm apple but if it is slightly soft things go bad . 
i use it in conjunction with my microwave bacon cooker and splatter screen . 
this order was a terrific bargain !  the product is excellent . 
it also recommends to clean them the same way a couple times a year to keep them supple . 
their web service costs extra ,  and it has problems viewing many page formats  says  network gremlins  when you try . 
again ,  i know this is not an expensive headset and is not perfect . 
these cases look great and feel good in the hand . 
superb suction ,  compact and light weight ,  but does not feel flimsy . 
i cook sticky ,  oozy ,  yummy sweet potatoes that caramelize and leave sticky baked on drippings all over the place . 
we are using them everyday ,  no tarnishing ,  cleans well in sink or dishwasher . 
i can t rate the windshield mount since i haven t used it . 
the air quality indicator is a very nice feature . 
i thought this was going to cost me hours in clean up num_extend
when taking the case off the black hard part separates from the rubber part . 
i know this is a rather generic review ,  but i use this thing all the time for ,  well ,  everything . 
you will have to use a pot holder or something to keep your fingers from burning . 
handle has a nice texture and even when wet the knife is still easy to use not much slippage  . 
thank god for going with my first mind !  !  this machine is incredible . 
i have a rainbow vacuum cleaner ,  and i can see how much carpet fuzz ,  etc . 
like all of the butterfly meadow ,  the photos don t do them justice . 
the lids work fine if applied as instructed . 
as stated before by me ,  these are a nice weight ,  and are microwaveable and dishwasher safe . 
now it is easier ,  though i have to pull hard . 
it s small size also allows it to fit nicely in the dishwasher . 
i carry my phone wherever i go and use it in the case on a windshield mount . 
you can then remove it from the app screens . 
of course back then it was made in the us .  .  . those were the days . 
sound quality is very good with this bluetooth ,  even in windy conditions . 
my phone s battery lasts longer and the cable feels very stable . 
the waffle cone maker browns evenly and is easy to keep clean . 
it automatically conforms to the current position of your body as it moves around . 
there s no uncertainty whether or not a can will fall out of an electric can opener s feeble grasp . 
i purchased this item for processing small amounts of veggies ,  etc . 
used some of the nonstick in the past ,  and don t like it ,  or trust it . 
this was my num_extend i have purchase in num_num years . 
i use it to cut a lot of vegetables to blend and make a vegetable smoothie every day . 
i went to a homegoods store and took out and looked at all the mandolines there . 
i tried out several pans before making a decision . 
our old percolator wasn t getting the coffee very hot . 
the lodge is flat handle to handle so a spatter screen completely covers it . 
this addition to my tablet gave me a lot more flexibility to share photos with clients or friends . 
stuck on the inner side of my security cabinet like it was made for the purpose . 
nothing i use does it right the very first time . 
both buttons were easy to use and responsive . 
i highly recommend purchasing one ,  especially at the current price of $
we have enjoyed a delicious pot roast ,  chicken with veggies ,  and a hard to cook oxtail stew . 
we are only num_num people and i like to make different kinds of bread every week . 
i m a legal consultant and the iphone must work all the time .  .  . no excuses !  .  .  . here s hoping . 
also these will be great for when i have guests over . 
a fork several times on all sides or use the prongs on the bottom of the cooker . 
anyone who uses cast iron should also have these handle covers . 
as far as small flash drives that require external power i have no idea . 
this was occasionally a problem when i was texting or typing . 
when i first received this item ,  i didn t realize the two containers were attached at the bottom . 
plus ,  they are not too heavy at all ,  but yet obviously sturdy . 
onions and other vegetables still stick to the knife a bit . 
this is not major but just an occasional happening . 
fits in all of the charger ports in the car . 
love the compact shape and dishwasher friendly cleaning !  great for arthritic hands if you have them . 
i owned my first one for about num_num years . 
my only complaint is it has too many openings for dirt to get into which slightly scratched the screen . 
easy to grip ,  easy to clean ,  and makes my omelettes fluffy . 
beyond a shadow of a doubt ,  these soft sheets are a gift from heaven . 
have you ever misplaced your phone ?  of course ,  we all have . 
if my cap reaches that state ,  i will try soaking it in vinegar before spending money on a replacement . 
i suppose you shouldn t seal the lid when microwaving stuff !  . 
now im with verizon and i had to downgrade from a smartphone because of financial issues . 
looks kind of like a vinyl record pattern . 
this is a must have product for any serious cookie maker . 
cons :  they are considerably heavier than corded headphones and become a bit uncomfortable after an hour . 
i purchased these creen protectors for my niece . 
it opens the can smoothly ,  no missed edges and the lid never falls into the product . 
i was a little disappointed at the beginning ,  thinking i was getting a num_extend
i have never purchase anything like this and would highly recommend it to anyone . 
however ,  the cost is much num_extend yes ,  as others have noted ,  this headset is made of hard plastic . 
look all pans sooner or latter need to be replaced . 
most people have to go outside to get a decent phone call . 
the bread knife makes short work of slicing bread without compressing the bread . 
they were crisp ,  but not browned at lower settings . 
even when food sticks to the surface ,  soaking in water removes it quite easily . 
scorpion is a good name for this little vac . 
between myself ,  and my clients ,  i use these several times a week . 
i keep it on the charger attached to the wall whenever i m not using it . 
you can listen to music on your phone and also receive calls . 
another one lost a wheel ,  but it is so light it is easy to carry . 
i filled out their claim form online and took photos of the case as required . 
i may seek a refund from the online vendor and look into alternative sync software . 
but that means keeping a supply of vacuum bags handy . 
it was my fault; i didn t expect the meat to dry nearly so quickly as it did . 
saves money now i no longer buy bottled water . 
it worked great !  but the lip over the front glass was non existent . 
i ve used this in profesional kitchens with no problem ,  and at home with no problem . 
these work great for the ball regular mouth jars i purchased . 
now i think atrix is simply the best . 
i never used it to charge my phone from % yet . 
if it does not work ,  well heck free return courier to amazon . 
it is extremely well made and feels great on hand . 
this was fine for corralling the mess ,  but they would get so dusty . 
i have one of those big kitchenaid mixers  mainly for making bread . 
it s not good ,  it s not bad ,  it s just different . 
can change ringtones and background without using the internet or phone company  unlike my old samsung  . 
this was a requested gift for our daughter . 
i believe this one is a bit better ,  but it may be because the other one was dying . 
i m thrilled by the growing trend of usb chargers . 
i never fully realized how much i could enjoy different juices until i got this . 
i do not use nonstick pans for anything . i hope this is helpful . cheers , neil etter  .  .  .   . 
this is my first immersion blender and use it several times a week to cream my soups . 
i ve compared this case now to numerous cases that friends have on their phones ,  and i m incredibly satisfied . 
i especially recommend this pot to anyone who may suffer the same problem as me . 
it s well built ,  compact ,  and does a great job for my purposes; be it nuts ,  breath mints or cannabis . 
it is so cheaply made and inefficient ,  i kicked myself for a year after wasting my money on it . 
resistant to stains and stays in place well while in use . 
i received this ice cream maker attachment as a free bonus . 
thankfully ,  you can find those in other reviews . 
i have had mine for almost num_num years and it is still going strong . 
it is inexpensive ,  easy to clean and i like having the handle and pour spout . 
the back however is rather challenging to get off . 
it s great for making tzatziki and other different spreads and dips . 
the applications are good enough for a business person  at least to me ,  being a graduate student  . 
my old carafe  despite its many faults  could keep the coffee hot all day long no matter the amount . 
 i measured  . it was a bit of a learning curve when i first used it . 
i don t use it often ,  i ve used it only twice since i purchased it and like it very much . 
i have no reason to lie to you about it . 
sturdy and the red goes with my accents in my kitchen . 
this new trent icruiser num_extend is very portable as it fits in a jacket pocket . 
i got this as a christmas gift and it does the job . 
we do stuff them downward so that the spray arm will clear the edge when the unit is closed . 
this machine is the perfect size and strength for the tasks i have in the kitchen . 
it just flat out works !  its easy to install in the case ,  buttons all work with ease . 
she likes to cook  and bake  on weekends . 
also ,  you can choose to make them smaller  less batter  or full size . 
it is impossible clean the oven once it is a mess with dripping . 
it was ugly and took up a ton of space . 
i would use this one at my desk for the stylus but not necessarily bring to meetings . 
the mixing spoon is useful for any kitchen task that requires a spoon . 
we served delicious turkey for both thanksgiving and christmas . 
this is a great web site to shop from . 
sometimes they would not shut off when the water boiled . 
i have seen some bad reviews on this battery ,  but luckily both of mine have been great . 
finally ,  the headphones themselves feel a little heavy in my ears . 
this is just a basic screen protector ,  i think . 
the machine sounds like a coffee machine which is pretty neat . 
love eating pancakes in the morning now ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  yum  !  !  !  !  !  . 
i use them with my big green egg . 
 :  i ordered my case on the afternoon of the num_extend and received it on the num_extend
it is quick and makes hot coffee or tea  replace filter with tea bags  . 
dust puffs up everywhere . the suction really is not bad . 
the design is sturdy and it comes apart for washing in the dishwasher . 
so far i have used it many times and it functions perfectly . 
been in use for three years now and works great . 
the outer black case even has a strap to carry it easily . 
my ongoing problem has always been getting them to stay put . 
it holds up well ,  enduring num_num hour long stints of flipping crepes . 
this makes for a very convenient combination when mobile . 
this num_num  cm  steamer fits the num_num qt .  ,  num_num qt .  ,  and num_num qt . 
as with all nordic ware products ,  this one feels sturdy and i know will last for years . 
i only drink skim milk but it gives me great results every time . 
this is a great cell phone or ipod stand for traveling . 
rcvd today num_extend and used it for waffles . 
the alarm is loud enough to hear in another room and it looks very stylish and modern . 
it s nothing unusual however it doesn t come with oem samsung retail package . 
i gave it as a gift and the person really likes it . 
very pleased . update :  after ten months it lost its suction . 
it can take awhile to get the hang of it to avoid too many grounds in the cup . 
but once it seals ,  the cooker is eerily quiet . 
the last one worked for about num_num years . 
the smallest bud and the medium loop make the fit perfect for me . 
this case protected the phone from anything and everything . 
i would recommend using a credit card or one of those keychain cards ,  it will not scratch it . 
some would say it is a butter knife cutting through heated butter . 
one caution though ,  if you have a dvd player that can access bluetooth be careful . 
practice your coordination dont blame the screen protector . 
with these ,  i no longer have to worry about keeping track of plates or trays . 
it broke within a week ,  the spin was so weak it didn t remove any moisture whatsoever . 
it has stayed up for num_num + weeks so i am hopeful it will stay up now . 
these reviewers must have a defective charger or are doing something wrong . 
make sure your bird is fully thawed ,  with no ice or water in it . 
i puchased this pan in two different sizes . 
easy clean up and works great even for a recipe that calls for the smallest amount of lemon juice . 
that your re processing on a regular basis for a healthier lifestyle . 
you just need to be really patient though and not rush through the process ,  to avoid damaging your phone . 
this young lady just  , over into her first apartment . 
the krups also has a slightly bigger grill surface . there s my num_num cents . 
these stands make the room look a lot better . 
i think i ended up with about num_num but don t use them much anymore . 
you can adjust it in very small increments if needed . 
i ve used a lot of bluetooth headsets over the years ,  some good ,  some bad . 
handy for the grill ,  cause you can take it outside too . 
it s a gift of love and lasts a lifetime . 
there isn t anything i would change about this machine except maybe the travel cup and the price is unbeatable . 
if you decide not to get this peel ,  you should take a close look at those . 
after a few weeks i m seeing rust spots in the sponge caddy . 
this crock pot looks good and works well . 
this is one of the best items to have for the kitchen . 
no ,  it is not a belgian waffle maker ,  but a classic one . 
i double this to use to make grape juice . 
i purchased this one for use at office .  .  . performed as expected and really inexpensive . 
no matter who i talk to i can hear great every time . 
the rubber protrudes away from the screen so not only does it not impact the screen but no sliding . 
i bought as a gift for chef in the family . 
the rubber material gives you a great grip with will prevent it being dropped . 
i can never have enough extra juice for all of my electronic gadgets . 
however ,  this newer version doesn t seem to have as loud a speaker as it s predecessor . 
the do feel a little plasticy compared to some other chargers ,  but can t beat the price . 
tried a cheap set and those scratched in days . 
i like my stainless bowls ,  too ,  but because they are so light weight ,  they require a pretty firm grip . 
i had one already and needed a second one so i could make several layers at once . 
i initially used it in my kitchen to hold chalk and things when my backsplash was magnetic . 
i do use the table spoon to measure out drops of cookie dough and there was no bending involved . 
however ,  it seems to be self healing and the blemishes work themselves out . 
the light weight of it is just what my arthritic hands need . 
i turn it on when he goes to sleep at night and for naps and he loves it too . 
my original machine is num_num yrs old and still working just great . 
spooning the chopped food out of the container was very easy ,  and the clean up was likewise . 
they are cheap and work for what i need . 
my girls just love being able to chose a new case or cover and this give them options daily . 
he thought it was the best thing ever . 
i had been watching this and also the varitilt num_extend
durable ,  consistent and a fun part of the morning ritual . 
holds the charge just as long as original battery when new . 
well there really isn t any extra room in that on the counter tops . 
opening programs and web pages are very fast . 
we like the unit so much that we have started giving it as christmas gifts and birthdays . 
my phone hangs up when the other party disconnects and conveniently ,  so does the headset . 
these work well for small bags and notes stuck to the fridge . 
here is why this is not for num_extend
warm the pan on low to almost medium heat . 
it works well for sewing crochet squares together and hiding threads . 
this popped our corn kernels quickly and nearly completely . 
also ,  i hope in a near future to have an opportunity to test one of their premium num_extend models . 
i use this to powder sugar ,  make mustard powder and any herbs i may want to chop up . 
narrow enough bowl to get in and fill up . 
just what i was looking for but i really wanted a purple one . 
nonetheless ,  the cups can easily come off with the teflon coating on the ring . 
i ve even played music through it with my phone and it sounds pretty darn good . 
i was so amazed at the functionality of this bluetooth . 
num_num pounds is not unrealistic here although i have not weighed it . 
its a minor inconvenience considering this device still works perfectly . 
i tried both ports and the ipad shows the charging indicator in both . 
i chose this one because of the top reviews . 
so you actually have five areas on which to store items . 
they should add a plastic lid over the buttons to avoid this . 
after years of fighting the ironing cord i finally wised up and ordered the cord minder . 
if you ve used calphalon products in the past you ll like this . 
i wish the price was lower ,  but otherwise great . 
we bought the jug to store fresh green juice that we make every week . 
one without a blade for slicing ,  and the num_num blades for julienne . 
it rubs together at the edge facing you ,  the side away from the hinge . 
i had this set ,  along with num_num leftovers of the jahi knives out for christmas . 
and you might ,  and this is the one to get . 
the quality is great and the price is fantastic . 
the dyson has very strong suction and does not lose suction power ,  even when the bin is num_extend
not too light and not too heavy . its made of good quility wood and i do recommend this board . 
loves how the tray has a drip pan and can easily be put in dishwasher . 
don t understand why others say it is loud ,  because it is not . 
in short ,  it makes salads worth the trouble again . 
all arrived in perfect order ,  the quality and glaze is wonderful . 
my husband loves to cook and was very happy to get this . 
i can t see that this one could damage a cookbook in any way . 
infuse is large so did not want too much bulk . 
this allows a very non cumbersome fell yet keeps my phone charged all day . 
i now can grill veggies ,  burgers ,  steak ,  etc . 
steel chopsticks always gave me the willies . i have to say i was wrong . 
i use it right on the table !  inexpensive . 
this was probably the best phone case i ve ever owned . 
so i suppose that for me the fancy steamer us a plus . 
 : dthese headphones are also light weight and feel pretty comfortable . 
i ve had the product for years and they probably don t offer this particular product anymore . 
after all ,  i d gotten along all this time without one . 
the temperature is very consistant across the griddle and the pancakes cook evenly . 
unfortunately i couldn t get it to fit with any of the cases that i have . 
i didn t realize that this item does not have two usb ports when i ordered it . 
it s just tight enough to stay on in your pocket ,  thin enough to fit on the holster . 
i tried to sync some music files onto my iphone from my laptop and it did not work . 
i bought this comb because i had an idea about decorating cake . 
i love how this thing cleans the carpet . 
if you have never used one ,  charging pods are a great accessory . 
you get what you pay for . good deal considering the price ,  . 
it was becoming increasingly more difficult for me to use my old peeler due to arthritis . 
i chose the set with the glasses because i also was going to buy more glasses . 
so ,  i smoked it out for num_num hours ,  then num_num hour again the next day . 
no more !  i love this gadget !  i don t really get that it will  hold  num_num lbs . 
i have had several other products and this works really nice . 
we hand wash it like many other things ,  so the dishwasher is irrelevant . 
no ,  i haven t used it this way but i have scooped some very hard ice cream . 
the most important thing you should know is that this is a super clear screen protector . 
this bin is perfect for a home or office . 
num_num cent !  !  !  and it is a quality case . 
another benefit of using the stylus is it eliminates messy fingerprints on the screen . 
definitely a recommended purchase if you re looking for a quality pizza pan at a great price !  . 
unlike the num_extend i can put whatever features i want on my home page by adding apps or widgets . 
i tried it out and quickly found that it is fun and satisfying to use . 
they are the good sturdy quality fiestaware pieces that we expect from homer laughlin . 
but the num_num battery would not stay on . 
i have an old set of fire king with the gold rims . 
when i saw this one i jumped right on it and i m glad i did . 
great price for a genuine leather lambskin leather case . 
i mounted mine just above eye level so it s conventient for me . 
this was probably the most comfortable bluetooth headset i have ever tried . 
in my opinion the differences are only in appearance but not in functionality . 
huge capacity ,  charges ipad phone at same time . 
they are the perfect size for hanging  the push in half circle racks  . 
it s easy to clean and dry no complaints . 
this is the exact carafe that comes with the cuisinart unit . 
the lcd digits are large for easy reading . 
what can you say it is a water purifying pitcher and it purifies water . 
it really does clean the square footage it claims to . 
blood on the white potatoes or onions really doesn t look good ,  plus that darn cut has to heal too !  . 
i wish i had done that and saved the $ i spent on the expensive piece of junk . 
but i will not give the recipe out !  sorry . 
i use this product on my motorola bionic and it works great . 
i use that on smaller items and it has lasted and works just as fantastically . 
its right in line price wise with many other similar knives too . 
noise suppression was that good . the headset is larger than most ,  but i actually like that . 
will love to use them and find out how good they really are . 
wow !  this is the best smartphone i ve had so far . 
you cannot beat the price and for hard surfaces it works better than any upright i have owned . 
just don t do any dramatic temp changes ,  like with any glass ,  and you will be alright . 
i use this when i make coffee for myself . 
it does seem to charge the devices i have plugged into it fast ,  and it has been pretty reliable . 
but ,  i don t want to eat fiberglass so i am replacing the damaged one . 
i believed it would be something for people more professional than myself . 
no need to unplug the gps either . power enough for two charges + . small and powerful . 
this is not the cheap plastic piece that came with the ear piece . 
product i have purchased from amazon this year . 
the muffins burned a little on the bottom ,  so next time i ll have to watch them . 
it feels  budget  ,  but then this is priced accordingly . the thermometer simply sticks through the base under the main body . 
i am satisfied with this less expensive earbuds . 
not only is in wonderfully functional ,  it also looks quite cool in the kitchen . 
having a lifetime warranty on something you ll be using everyday is also a great plus on this set . 
invest in a plastic cleaning brush for cleaning . 
my one recommendation is to get the plate cleaning kit ,  too . 
perfect size and just what i needed and wanted . 
the value derived from this trip alone was enough to pay for this battery pack . 
product works very well pleased with its use . 
would ve rather seen an actual switch similar to what my treo had . 
i m fine with these pieces developing those symptoms over time from use ,  but not when it first arrives . 
when i first opened the package ,  it does not look like it will gets the job done . 
overall even with all the little quarks i m pleased with this product . 
grinds my coffee real fast and will also grind my spices . 
looks good ,  priced good but sound can be better . 
it is thin ,  but it s supposed to be and it s not unstable thin . 
i use this pot at practically ever dinner i prepare . 
i charged my motorola speaker without any problems . 
one small note ,  be sure the cap is extremely tight or it will leak . 
revere ware !  the existing lid fits well also . 
verizon wanted almost $ dollars for this battery i got it for under $ and it is new . 
gonna have to buy a second methinks . chris olsen . 
or you can put one egg in ,  break the yolk ,  and you get a  fried  egg in the microwave . 
it has num_num bento boxes with lids ,  they all are leak proof . 
it consistently produces a great cup of coffee and looks sleek and elegant while doing it . 
i started working for a company a few years ago and a girl had these . 
the smaller end fits perfectly into the holder . 
bought this for a friend who runs a performing arts facilty . 
after several weeks of use ,  we started getting tiny corrosion spots in the scoop bowl . 
and holding the phone on shoulder was too painful . 
just receive this honey server and it is the right size and very beautiful . 
but ,  it s not made of soft glass either . 
my mom had a goose wing feather duster to get excess flour out of the grooves . 
this is probably a good thing with regard to kneading thoroughly . 
these are very handy i use for everything ,  very durable , bought in num_extend
i know i wouldn t want to be without it . 
i was using duct tape for years to connect my delta band saw to my dust collecting system . 
perfect !  i then use the same bow to store my pineapple rings . 
i love  riced  potatoes and anticipate using this  food press  to make tomato purees and finish other fruit . 
we use this double griddle all the time . 
i love the removable handle that lets it conver to a dust buster style . 
no . i would recommend this product and purchase again . 
the install is much more involved than the iphone num_extend
after using this pan on numerous occasions recently it has produced excellent mini muffins . 
i have had no problems with food getting stuck in places ,  or cleaning it thoroughly . 
but the set also feels very good and ergonomic in your hand . 
no matter how carefully i placed the pitcher ,  the tea would spill out underneath the spout . 
i have a number of the commercial nonstick pans . 
i am not sure why they chose to use such a thin glass . 
highly recommended if you like a sanitary sink . 
this is not my own recommendation ,  this is the  proven  range for the best coffee extraction . 
can refrigerate the marble to keep cheeses hard for easier slicing . 
this makes them more comfortable for me but may actually contribute to the degraded sound num_extend
it is a quality piece of accessory for your iphone . 
but you can place the lid slightly askew and drain the contents of the can that way . 
most likely they did not have the space for a micro sd . 
my wife was cutting potatoes and sweet potatoes by hand to make fries but i found this on amazon . 
i think i ll pick up a couple more just in case . 
all the pieces fly apart and the batteries come out . 
chargers my iphones and ipad several full chargers before having to be recharged itself . 
i can view picttures ,  watch videos and copy files easily . 
i do not believe that you can go wrong by purchasing this grill . 
however ,  there are ways you can minimize this . 
i found the cooking times listed to be vastly under . 
the micro plane coarse and extra coarse graters still grate way more finely than a normal grater  . 
this own is by far the most clear ,  unencumbersome ,  comfortable set . 
i ve tried others ,  but the oxo is simply the best . 
after just a little trial and error ,  i am really enjoying my donvier yogurt maker . 
i found a pin on pinterest showing some scrapbook paper in the back of a clear case . 
she loves it ,  and has told me it works great . 
it has a simple design and is easily used and refilled . 
the hooks are movable which may or may not work for you . 
left one in to try and burn it ,  but after num_num minutes ,  no luck . 
we were also dreamers of the same kind . 
and i did . first they answered a question about why i couldn t charge a new usb chargeable item i bought . 
the machine is very easy to fill and one filling gives over a hour of steaming . 
it s a good size for small cutting tasks . 
with the num_extend design there are plenty of otterbox s in a variety of rainbow colors to choose from . 
it not only mixed everything throughly it did it quickly . 
i purchased this thermos because of past experience with nissan products . 
we love our panasonic vacuum ,  but for some reason ,  it chews up belts every few months . 
i watched the videos on you tube diligently about how to baby the omega vrt . 
heck ,  it took me a while to find out what the cooker s heat setting was . 
i had one once before ,  and when it wore out after about num_num years ,  we got a new model . 
i purchased two of these and love them . 
i don t think much can be said to complain about this mixer . 
fits phone great .  . just make sure you line it up properly to avoid bubbles . 
it seals as tight as the  brick  coffee in the store . 
the city constantly monitors water and  adjusts  additives to combat bacteria and other pollutants . 
this product is just amazing ,  and i would buy again . 
the pizza lifts easily from the pan to check the bottom of the crust . 
just be careful you don t flood your bathroom !  . 
this could be larger but still works very well for a griddle of bacon . 
nice long wands for ceiling cleaning  lots of spiders around here  . 
i like this one especially for its size and the fact that i can use either side . 
but in the grands scheme that s minor . alas ,  all this was too good to be true . 
and the directions are in grams and litres which makes it difficult to convert . 
this turner is a great asset to the nonstick pans i had purchased . 
makes a great gift or addition to any kitchen . 
also ,  it s lightweight and the lid locks easily so you can carry it . 
boiling water is a winner . leaks :  can t get this thing to leak . 
dell originally listed the venue pro has having num_extend of ram on its website ,  but it removed that spec . 
i have friends who hold their phones in their hands while they drive . 
the differences are mainly in comfort ,  style ,  and ease of use . 
i didn t expect it to be oem per se ,  but maybe a little closer would be nice . 
your phone can be easily be charged the powerskin case on . 
also ,  they have more spoon sizes than most . 
filter works great and fits the dustbuster perfectly . 
i think this things is about as well built as any other spatula of this nature . 
however ,  after a lot of research ,  i realized that they cost so much for a reason . 
the coffee comes out so much hotter than the drip maker that when i add creamer it s perfect . 
other ones i have seen are extremely large and look awkward to wear . 
i use this whenever i make apple pies or want to dry some apples in my dehydrator . 
the battery looked like a real samsung battery ,  just the wrong model number . 
this is exactly what i was looking for . 
so while searching the num_extend batteries available i found the anker . 
use mainly to charge my logitech performance mx mouse and the occasional iphone charge . 
the outside is as shown in the pictures ,  faux croc . 
i like the design of this egg slicer . 
the serrated edge works fine but the straight edge does let you slice a little thinner . 
we use this only on our ceramic tile kitchen floors . 
the cable was also able to charge my iphone via the usb on my macbook . 
the plastic casing and holster has a black rubberized material covering that gives it a bit more grip . 
that s easily fixed by running a long rod  like a skewer  through the hose to loosen up the debris . 
the hardest part was deciding how to cut it !  . 
it s sturdy and has little hooks that go over my dish rack . 
video chat with this phone works great with the front facing camera . 
give me another month and i probably will give it num_num stars . 
it does exactly what it s supposed to do and i m very ,  very happy with it . 
i had been looking locally for a clay pot and just couldn t find any . 
so ,  since quality and craftsmanship ,  along with price point all need considered ,  this was a great value !  . 
so i ruled out iphone and went on a search for the perfect phone . 
shipping and handling was high but i got the product i wanted so i am satisfied . 
this was a gift but i d used one before and found it very good . 
i raise great pyrenees ,  which have long ,  dense fur . 
you cannot cancel your previous service prior to calling virgin mobile to set up num_extend
i m very pleased with the quality and the price of this pan . 
i just prefer to heat ours in the microwave . i would purchase this machine again . 
but you sacrifice size for that much capacity . 
i m huge on using parchment as it saves a lot of washing when baking or cooking . 
love the extra mm of lay on the table  bumpers  on the four corners . 
the rings are split and it looks exactly like the picture . 
as we have a professional stove num_extend btu burners  we have to have an exceptionally strong exhaust fan . 
annoying . the phone comes loaded with only one ringer ,  nokia s ,  unless you add others . 
i liked the first so well that i bought another ,  because this is an essential tool in any kitchen . 
why  ?  !  why does this happen !  the dough hook is still in prefect condition . 
the smoke color blends in nicely with the captivate . 
well worth the investment in my opinion and my dad loves it . 
i liked this screen protector and it is great on the anti glare and fingerprints . 
i am enjoying the panasonic bread maker immensely . 
i have aluminum siding on the house and this can affect cell signal . 
cleaning them is a bit of a pain . 
it s made of plastic ,  and has a handle that works great . 
excellent cookware :  even heating ,  easy cleaning ,  and still looking good after one year of daily use . 
it has remained very sharp and easy to maintain . 
i ve tried a few of those wet applications and they never seem to work . 
i ve had one of these poppers for years and always loved it . 
i ve used it to make smoothies ,  soups ,  drinks ,  slushies ,  and baby food consistency meats for sick pets . 
once you get the hang of attaching it to the can ,  it works great . 
i waited a couple of weeks to try my ultimate chef s knife test :  chicken bones . 
num_extend it really does not let any of the num_extend design shine forth . 
with this unit it is very easy to set up . 
in all these many uses it has never disappointed . 
i use these containers to put my lunch in to take to work . 
keep in mind this will affect air movement . 
i was not sure that this could be worth the price reduction . 
it is the easiest way to boil eggs . 
but actually ,  that does not bother me at all . 
in our condo we had these timers in two of our bathrooms and i love them . 
this might not ever make it the the kitchen . 
the keys are raised and separated just enough to make typing quickly possible ,  and this from a serious klutz . 
i have never had issue with any of them ever warping like some reviews have mentioned . 
if your hands are bigger the brush should still be perfect . 
i must say that it sliced the cake very well . 
it s a great size  not too large ,  not too small  . 
i would still give all clad five stars because it is awesome to use . 
i bought these little fellows to open my phone and tablet . 
since it s a wired unit ,  there are no batteries to charge and it s always ready to go . 
it is lightweight and easy to push around without getting a hernia . 
fthe shelf ft perfectly under my bathroom sink . 
cooks num_num pounds of patty sausage in num_num minutes . 
at first glance you might think  what do i do with this ?  ?  ?   . 
so if thats what you want it for here you go . 
i use mine daily ,  and they are very much worth the great prices listed here . 
lifetime warranty but i don t think i ll be needing it for a long time . 
there is a complimentary screen protector that came with the case . 
i have had the new mixer for a year and haven t had a single problem . 
don t be an idiot like me and start preheating your pan while going thru your emails . 
don t be afraid !  today s pressure cookers are easy and safe to use . 
the protector was easy to apply ,  fit well ,  and is holding up well under heavy usage . 
i have a samsung captivate and didn t had any problem pairing it and using num_extend stars !  . 
i actually like the extra heft and ridge to hold it . 
keeps the coffee hot longer than glass beakers ,  but not as long as a real thermos bottle . 
we are big fans of cast iron in our house ,  and these are a must have for us . 
i have about num_num or num_num tools that fill this crock . 
does it s job well just like the other steel utensils . 
they are perfect; glide easily ,  and look nice . 
you don t get as much juice from it as they show you in the video . 
one has been broken by being dropped on the tile floor !  other than that . 
we have all sizes of the anchor hocking glass refrigerator storage containers and we are very pleased with them . 
that was not clear to me when i bought it . 
this oven does a good job with all of these items . 
just follow the instructions and you will have sharp knives again . 
custom roms is one of the biggest reasons why the num_extend was so popular . 
+ tax  and i find it is smaller than this one ,  even though they both have num_num slice capacity . 
recommend !  !  and it s a great price to boost your phone s antenna . 
it s a little inconvenient but i m fine with it . 
for the price you pay ,  you can t go wrong . 
the beautiful scarlet color made a simple gravy boat really shine on our thanksgiving table . 
these tongs are great for grilling !  i had looked all over for these . 
i borrowed this from a friend during a convention last year to charge my phone . 
now i ve written too long a review about too simple a product . 
i think this skillet performs satisfactorily; however ,  it makes a quite loud hum while in operation . 
i like how easily the rubber gasket comes out and goes back in for cleaning . 
it really is high quality compared with the short cord that comes with the ipad . 
hard to find just this size in the stores as everything is packaged with multiple sizes and wastes product . 
it s very affordable when compare to the original one from the wireless store . 
just remember to charge it every two or three months . 
this is a very good product and would recommend it ,  especially if price is an issue . 
great im just getting fater thanks to this lol .  .  .  .  .  . fun to make and smells sooooo good . 
i ve had one for years and i love it . 
this cover protected my phone for several months . 
you can t go wrong for $ check it out !  . 
the others make it hard to scroll on the phone ,  these make it smooth . 
only problem with it was you can only put your dl and num_num credit card in . 
she sent photos ,  and i must say they were beautiful . 
making popcorn is a snap using the presto hot air popper . 
it heats up fast and cools down fast as well . 
the pan is also large enough that i don t have to worry about making larger cakes . 
but no worries with this handy dandy grinder !  works great for both . 
i read one review where a user was complaining that the lid doesn t fit very tightly into the carafe . 
i should have paid more attention to the reviews and contrasted the descriptions . 
regular kill works at a specified interval ,  whether the phone is being used or not . 
the plastic is thicker and seems much sturdier . 
after a year of use ,  i still am grateful for this little guy . 
all other attachments and accessories are good quality . 
i can now honestly say ,   i toss my last bundt pan  .  .  . buy the pan ,  you won t be disappointed . 
they fold up into fairly flat packages to fit in the freezer . 
anything that can get power from a usb jack has worked in my tests . 
the handle stays surprisingly cool  as long as it s not directly over the flame ,  of course  . 
but ,  be warned ,  this baby is a monster . 
i think this oster would grind up a bowling ball if you could get it into the jar . 
it keeps coffee drinkably hot for num_extend hours . 
they do exactly what they are supposed to . 
i had to get one for just case i needed to take my micro back into my old phone . 
they should be able to count up ,  count down ,  beep when the timer is done . 
i will update in june after some real use but initial impression is very good . 
i needed num_num more screens to have num_num for my dehydrator . 
a red light on the headset turns blue when it is fully charged . 
the grill is fashioned to generate a  butterfly pattern  of air . 
i believe it was for an older model tab but it fits fine ,  not perfect but fine . 
other humidifiers have not seemed to prove as effective . 
they seems expensive  few bucks a pop  but are worth it . 
this bluetooth just like new !  i got it before day it sayed . 
poaches eggs perfectly ,  super nice ,  last a lifetime . 
we love to grill but didn t want to have to buy additional grill for our condo . 
i purchased this case num_num months ago and it s been housing my iphone num_extend for much of that time . 
it makes a light dust whenever you grind for a little while . 
these little bags are excellent !  they are perfect for quick and easy meals . 
it was delivered earlier than promised and i love the quality for the price . 
it seems to hold a charge much longer than the original samsung battery . 
it is matte and not shiny at all . 
all henckel knives are made to perfection and well balanced . 
fortunately ,  i was able to get my grandmother s waring blendor cookbook from the forties . 
i put this in the microwave with no problem . 
i have been using these bags for several years now . 
not large enough to knead bread on ,  thinking of getting the larger size for that . 
but if i did have to i would . 
would highly recommend !  !  !  ! i am adding onto my review after having the item for about num_num months . 
i ve had this grinder for a couple years ,  and i use it at least weekly . 
i got the num_extend too ,  and that s just as great . 
the num_num mp camera takes sharp pictures ,  and i was surprised at the quality of video capture . 
for $ i don t view this as any problem . 
and i make num_extend instead of their puny sized ones !  . 
after taking a wire brush and high temp spray paint to the cooker it looked as good as new . 
no more uneven and messy cookie dough dropping with spoons . 
it just plain fits perfect and holds all day long . 
the touch screen keyboard is actually better than i expected . 
we use a baking mat on top of it ,  and it s perfect for cookies and other baked items . 
the control button on the headphone is very easy to use and supports voice dialing or last number redial . 
love the stacking option which is unique to this item !  great price also for num_num ramekins . 
it s cover is very strong and will not crack ,  or at least hasn t yet . 
i bought a few of these and a couple of them had bad wire connections on the left speaker . 
then i saw this pop up on the screen . 
i will only talk about why i currently prefer the torch vs . 
it was wonderful for shaving hard cheese on pasta and you could use less ,  which is great for dieting . 
she said it was the best present we ever got her . 
the device will cancel out some wind noise ,  but not entirely . 
it took num_num hours and num_num minutes to charge back up to num_num percent . 
having the mophie juice pack around is ideal for those situations . there s a lot to like about this item . 
i would be happier if they lasted longer ,  but they last about as i would expect for $ headphones . 
i ve had a few of these ,  and so far i m impressed . 
was very cheap and works as it should . 
i already own an iqair healthpro plus ,  but it isn t sufficient to cover my entire house . 
with the other models ,  either i ,  the caller ,  or both of us couldn t understand a word being said . 
people on the other end can t tell i m on a wireless headset . 
and i was floored by the overwhelming negative reviews . my only guess . 
still means something to the fine folks who build these . 
i purchased this before thanksgiving and cooked a stuffed num_num lb turkey in it . 
i lvoe unusual cake pans and amazon always has what i am looking for . 
i suspect however that people who aren t used to electronics might stumble a bit with this one . 
so for $ per megb it will cost you . so for less than $ it a perfect smart phone . 
you can t go wrong with this case unless you need something that will be water or shock proof . 
previously i had to cook one size of a layer at a time ,  so this was a welcome splurge . 
but here s the thing ,  after a bit it ll start to wear and tear . 
but other than that a very nice coffee maker . 
i keep it covered when not in use soi can keep it out on the counter . 
i don t understand how it works ,  but it does . 
be sure you want to use if for small volume drinks . 
all fittings including blades and stem are sized different . 
it is unfortunate you do not have num_num real options with att and verizon due to att s weaker signal . 
perfect to have in florida !  !  !  my only disappointment is that the buttons are a little awkward to use . 
i think the metal frame is the weak link . 
in case it matters ,  i purchased from sf planet . 
this thing is perfect :  strong ,  flexible layout ,  easy to assemble with a mallet ,  looks great ,  good price . 
nice if you want to conserve battery power and want to turn your phone  off  at night . 
i recall being impressed with the build quality right away when taking it out of the box . 
i still have these prestos and they are like new . 
the braun has so many nice features ,  it s hard to know where to start . 
this is so much better than my little glass one . 
make sure you take good care of this thing and it ll last forever . 
num_num mah means several phone charges ,  or one full phone and tablet recharge throughout the day . 
 no ,  couldn t find anything on the internet either .   . 
it is an absolute joy to use .  .  . no  hot spots  al all ,  just an even temp . 
in that case ,  just plug in the phone . 
the one she had was a two piece ,  click together that didn t provide much protection for her phone . 
works perfectly with multiple android devices and my windows phone devices too . 
i have had so much fun with this machine !  and the results have been wonderful . 
good fan for drawing in the cool night air . 
this is a very nice case and what makes it even better is the super low price . 
basically ,  the griffin power duo is almost useless for this phone . then i found this oem motorola auto charger . 
it does seem to discharge slightly faster than the stock battery . 
they do add a very faint tint to the screen . 
i have bought the best and they work good with the all the phone that i have bought . 
i ve charged it once the day i reviewed it and it s still going ,  battery level  high  . 
ok ,  i still use the starbucks espresso beans ,  i love the flavor . 
i started out with the jack lalanne power juicer which was great until a critical plastic part broke . 
mine just arrived num_num sept num_extend and it now has rounded over edges . 
really good quality ,  looks like it will last forever . 
for the price ,  these are so worth it !  they all work well on my galaxy and my ipad . 
im extremely pleased with the product and service . the item was shipped quickly and reached as confirmed . 
i placed a batch in the utensil basket and one somehow slipped out  they are thin  . 
there are a few instructions before you get started such as soaking the filter . 
it took me about five minutes to put it together using the enclosed allen wrench . 
i m happy to report that this headset delivers nicely in this area . 
although they are not razor sharp right from the package ,  their edges are sharp enough for the average cook . 
 ours is many years old ,  cost under num_num num_extend
so ordered num_num sets of the num_num livingware . 
i ve used a blade grinder for enternity and finally after doing research made this purchase . 
i buy a lot of cutters for my polymer clay jewelry pendants . 
all have worked great and so very much cheaper than purchasing from local stores . 
i have used thirstystone for a while now and love them . 
the people on other side can hear everything clearly ,  even some sounds which i don t notice . 
when i got it i didn t think it was much . 
after trying different methods ,  i find that its best to keep the amount of popcorn to a minimum . 
no spilling in the saddle bag and it keeps whatever you put in it ,  hot . 
my sink has a water filter so the brew center water filter is not a selling point for me . 
wash and dry it as soon as you are done with it  it should last a life time . 
came home and checked amazon and there they were !  !  !  !  he is very happy with them . 
after num_num more attempts ,   not the same night  ,  trying different oil amounts . 
my dad travels a lot for work and is a pretty practical guy . 
measuring cups can be loosened from the connecting ring individually . 
what is ther not to like about this mixer . 
i ve dropped a couple accidentally and nothing happened . 
this pan is reasonably priced and surprisingly is from germany which perhaps helps the quality . 
simply put ,  the quality of the product matches the service of the seller . 
this item is a great buy for anyone who needs a first or replacement charger . 
the replacement back cover fits nicely ,  despite what some people reported . 
not a big fan of beats audio ,  not a big fan . 
this is a delightfully easy way to make ice cream that tastes the way you want it to . 
i ve even mixed and kneaded bread dough in this thing and it has come out perfect every time . 
i d recommend it for anyone who likes a healthy ,  filling snack that takes very little time to make . 
my husband and i both purchased these on amazon for our new blackberry phones . 
i received it num_num days after ordering and used it that night to sharpen all the knifes . 
it s rather large but makes a great small background noise . 
i would strongly recommend this product ,  i don t regret my purchase at all . 
unlike a lot of other reviewers ,  i ve had no problems with broken hinges or overcooking . 
it is not made of thick metal ,  and therefore feels just a little cheap . 
this lasted me a long time num_extend months  . 
my bother change the blackberry for this phone . 
the glass door also worries me ,  since it does not latch when you close it . 
oh ,  and as a bonus it s made in the usa . 
that was it ,  no effort at all ,  no pressure applied . 
it is clean ,  it never touches the food . 
very easy to use and keeps your hands on the wheel while in the car . 
into the silverware drawer ,  between the stove and cupboard ,  and onto the floor . 
takes up most of a shelf in the cabinet . 
the product is good ,  the price is also ok but . 
i also keep some of these in the house so i always have some kleenux . 
what a difference it makes . most cookware is way too thin ,  which leaves you with hotspots . 
the feel of this product is really solid . 
this product annoys me how it has  iphone  in the title because it s for literally thousands of phones . 
it s sure something !  and at less than $ it s a bargain . 
these are made very well but not that well . 
this adapter works very well for my samsung cell phone . 
i can t imagine cooking anything that would require a bigger pan . 
unfortunately the unit i was sent had a defective talk button on it . 
the plum is a gorgeous purple and looks especially nice with a jumbo mug in sunflower or lemongrass . 
don t fix more than what you will drink within an hour . 
cord detaches so you can bring hot water out to the table for tea without trailing a wire . 
it is the only one i have ever seen that doesn t make the little whiskers . 
the device itself remains an easily cleaned  and lovingly polished  centerpiece in my tiny and busy kitchen . 
i bought this after my regular electric knife went kaput over easter ,  and the  backup  failed me as well . 
while you don t need this to make great yogurt it certainly helps to keep things neat and clean . 
i typicall use my  slotch  clock app ,  or my  animated weather  app when using the cradle . 
so now i have to buy a new set . 
coffee  and work as well as any filter i ve used . 
the blender jar could have a more defined spout ,  but i have had no issues with spilling . 
i will use realook in the future for sure if they keep the quality at this level . 
finally ,  i received this one and it was great !  !  . 
i bought this clay roaster after reading many reviews . 
we used it a couple or more times a month without any function problems . 
the ones with an even brim will have problems with liquid pouring out of the cup from the top . 
i have bought three of them for friends after i bought mine . 
these are not adjustable ,  so if they re too tight or slipping off your ears you should consider returning them . 
excellent quality and price would buy it again !  . 
it stayed charged for over twenty hours while running several devices . 
kind of a strange way of assembling it . 
you can t do that with foil wrapped over the pan . 
i ll let you know in a few months . 
let s see ,  i bought the bluetooth headset way back in august and the price on amazon is still $
i wanted a very good pepper mill ,  and this one is great . 
i ve fit an entire shaws brand frozen pizza in this ,  to my boyfriend s shock . 
i got this coffee press for my office ,  everyday i make num_num full pot in the morning . 
smooth it out if needed ,  then peel off the top protector sheet ,  and there you have it !  . 
i don t like that there s no lid for it ,  but i have a spatter guard that works fine . 
it comes up automatically when you place the phone in the dock . 
i ve had this for num_num years now and it looks and feels like it s new . 
this steamvac was a gift for our daughter because she was always borrowing our steamvac . 
this stone is the best i ve had ,  the size is perfect and it is very well made . 
speed num_num should do the trick and not damage your grinder or mixer . 
these are very ,  very nice and worthy of their reputation . 
i love the way this looks ,  i plan on ordering more . 
i m now sold on the idea of a metal grid . 
they are so helpful to keep both places organized and providing more counter space . 
now she raves about how much she loves the top style openers . 
this is a very nice product at an exceptional price . 
i first encountered one of these while camping and it was phenomenal . 
i can place the machine anywhere on the cart ,  and still clamp it . 
has plenty of room for milk to expand . 
but the best thing about these mills is the way they grind . 
then we tested the intercom and the phone features .  .  . there are two ways to use the intercom . 
i have not been disappointed in buying them this great little unit . 
i have banged them against the faucet a few times and they are still perfect . 
okay ,  my old rusty can opener died after many years of use . 
the film was minutely too long for my phone . 
i m a retired chef who still loves to cook . 
it is good looking ,  very functional ,  holds quite a bit . 
if i were to order another ,  i d definitely go with the longer num_extend orange model . 
i get a lot of positive comments on both color and appearance . i really like the appearance of the unit . 
looks just like the one in the photo as well . 
i have an apartment with wooden floors and i am so happy i went with this vacuum !  . 
in this regard ,  the rabbit s design is far superior . 
you want the bad boys of measuring cups then look no further . 
i store many food items in glass and these caps are great and dishwasher safe . 
this was expected since my burner has a much smaller radius than the bottom of this pan . 
i cut the large pomegranate i use in num_extend and squeeze them that way . 
but it really helps free up space in the pantry and keep things organized . 
it holds my galaxy num_extend skyrocket real well . 
the problem is most likely with how feverishly you spin that lever and how you feed the wheatgrass . 
i had initially ordered a set of these a few weeks back . 
this press is a much sturdier design ,  and i look forward to using it often . 
i cut num_extend of dough a day and it has been perfect and stayed sharp . 
otherwise this thing is awesome ,  lasts me well into a second day with light to moderate use . 
it is rugged enough and snap fits well . 
i love the little straw for sipping while i m driving . 
everytime i look at it ,  mysterious new dimples appear . 
i m wondering the egg would cook better if the diameter of the ring was larger . 
they are available at good prices here on amazon . sound quality from the earpiece is decent . 
products work well use it when walking secure and stays safely attached . 
they are just fabulous and don t dilute the icing at all . 
this is the perfect size for frosting cupcakes . 
since i keep my stylus in my ipad bag ,  it s not a problem for me . 
people were saying that they couldn t hear me or that there was too much static . 
this is the best car charger that i ve ever used . 
these feel more fragile than all of my other fiesta ,  but seem to hold up just as well . 
if this ever dies ,  i will immediately order a replacement . 
it has just the right weight . it may not have the mystique of expensive japanese or german knives . 
i was extremely happy and i can t wait to get a new one !  !  !  !  . 
it s just better in every way than any vacuum i ve ever used . 
if there is a stain in the future i plan on using some barkeepers friend . 
this case has the cuttes color ever i just love it and the price is so low . 
this battery actually backwards compared to the battery that originally came in my phone . 
after using this item for months i am % happy with it . 
this dish drainer is very similar to my old one . 
i even purchased one for my husband and he loves it too . 
this pitcher was the perfect size to make my large white chocolate mocha . 
the unit lets you adjust the width to meet your needs as well . 
the quality is the same as the blackberry i got from sprint . 
i boiled the timer twice before using it with eggs and the smell went away just fine . 
even though its small ,  it still feels solid and well built . 
it is especially good for turning pieces of frying chicken . 
this is a replacement for one i have used for num_num years . 
if you want an ipod get an ipod . 
i prefer the squat proportions for ease of use under the cabinets . 
it also provides two full size usb ports . 
i have been using them for at least num_num years now and have no broken a single one . 
i love ,  love ,  love this kettle !  it heats up water super fast and holds a lot of water . 
larger than my hand , or any one i know ,  but it still works the same . 
it won t put pleats in your pants or give you a crisp  ironed  look . 
the first num_num rice cookers i bought were in the $ price range and made mediocre rice . 
i never used amazon much ,  one day started browsing and found the pieces in one place . 
these guys got it right and there is no need to buy any other cutting board . 
this gets lots of wear and tear from my num_num yr . 
of course build quality is way below the jambox though it is quite decent . 
it s good white noise that drowns out all the noises coming in from outside . 
there is no better electric kettle out there for the money . 
this does okay if you re not piling it up high . 
it fits great in your hand and works great . 
these are much better that the other ones i had purchased . 
 i suspect give ,  but what the heck ,  i am not their customer . 
since this color is completely sheer ,  i use it on top of my french manicures . 
i did a trial run with the standard spritz cookie recipe . 
if you do the things on this way everything will work for you . 
this is a good product that was as described in the amazon description . 
there s clear reason why this is the highest rated skin for the iphone num_extend on amazon . 
whereas ,  front end of the holder rotate @ num_num degree . 
i accidentally knocked one of these glasses onto a kitchen floor covered in glazed ceramic tile . 
great backup battery with a compact size and good power capacity . 
if you take a lot of pictures ,  get the defender series . 
i m sure i could fit a few more utensils in there without issue if i needed to do so . 
i do sometimes hear the  click  from the unit switching off when the water is ready . 
this measuring cup is easy to hold and has easy to read markings . 
i ve also used it to grind fresh spices ,  and it works really well to make fresh nutmeg . 
wow !  this thing ain t playing games !  keeps my tea hot all day . 
it heats up fast and shuts off by itself . 
i have not had the opportunity to remove one yet . 
i use my oven a lot less for cooking small things . 
i couldn t be happier . it was well packed ,  in a larger carton with plenty of the big bubble pads . 
she thinks it very high quality and she will use it a lot . 
tucked into the waistband at the small of my back it was better . 
i can stream mlb tv and post on baseball threads . 
only improvement i can think of is even less bulky and possibly more colors to choice from . 
we ve learned a lot about cooking techniques ,  and have purchased items based on their test result recommendations . 
this table cloth really brightens up the room without being overwhelming . 
the different sizes fit all my knives and stay on knives . 
other than that small complaint ,  i m quite happy with it ,  and i highly recommend . 
lastly ,  the word  professional  in the product s title is misleading since the manual disclaims its commercial use . 
this phone has a microsd slot so you can add tons of your own music to it . 
since i only got the unit ,  i cannot say anything about the brewer stopping halfway through the process . 
i have several less expensive units that have diagonal blades and they are close to useless . 
some of the fuctions such as gps and watching videos causes my droid x to get too hot . 
fills the bowl with half the scoops needed with my one cup . 
however ,  thebelkin micro usb charger with chargesync cablein my car fits loosely and can sometimes disengage . 
it is the best hand held mixer i have ever used . 
so it does not cause me trouble as i don t put cd s in and out . 
takes up very little space and looks great on the stove . 
this product is great for breads ,  quick breads and loaf cakes . 
i think we got lucky with studs that were close together . 
i would highly recommend this product to family or friends . 
they seem to be holding up well and we will buy more . 
amazing what a truly sharp knife can do . 
i am a first time burr grinder user . 
i bought a couple more to ahve as bask up when this one wear out . 
i got my brother this product for his phone and he really loves the fit and stretch . 
great portable charging or powering solution on the go . 
it isn t as bright as the pink ,  but looks very nice on the phone . 
also ,  the bottom draw tends to stick and be a little annoying to pull out . 
in fact ,  it was covered in machine oil and wrapped in plastic . 
i mostly use them now for turning boneless ,  skinless chicken thighs over in the skillet . 
it also leaves a smaller hole in the finished bread . 
that ll save you a lot of money over verizon s cases they have to offer for this phone . 
saves me time slaving away over crushing limes ,  mint ,  etc . 
i mean ,  just sitting in their own heat will take them from soft boiled to medium boiled . 
after using a wisk to beat eggs you will notice a froth on top and throughout the liquid . 
i got this for my old vac . fits fine ,  works ,  i have a spare ,  life is good . 
not really chicago metallic s fault ,  just something to watch out for . 
so far ,  it truly is crystal clear and created somewhat of a naked feel to the phone screen . 
the material is a durable plastic which also cleans very easily . 
the quesadilla will not seal and the juice or flowing lava cheese will run out of the front . 
this case is a competitor to otterbox commuter case . 
then i can microwave what i need later . 
i still use it and i m still happy with my purchase . 
i am not an advocate for serrated knives ,  but these knives are great . 
my cover arrived in just a few days and was exactly as described and expected . 
bought a few hard case covers with different designs as birthday presents to myself . 
they said they could definitely hear a little wind noise ,  but it didn t hinder the call in any way . 
i m not going to keep them in the original case . 
their bluetooth headsets in particular ,  are among the best that money can buy . 
i ve removed and reapplied the case numerous times  with care of course  and had no pieces break off . 
the sides are fine i had lot of lee way and did not need much . 
i will probably be buying more of these soon . 
does not have to have the screen cover on you can use screen protectors instead if you like . 
seems the more you pay for your rice the less time you ll spend rinsing it . 
i bought this set from amazon two years ago when i bought my first house . 
i added num_num non skid adhesive feet to each corner to prevent sliding . 
just learn a technique and you are good . the steamer mop is great . 
the design works well with the evo num_extend
i almost wish it had a bag that you could throw out ,  instead of a cup . 
this is not the best made item ,  but certainly worth the low cost . 
i keep it boxed so the grandkids can t try to see what it does . 
made life much easier with having extra cords to use with computer while traveling . 
however ,  i have not since been able to get the device to activate the voice control feature . 
i just hope it is able to maintain a reliable connection over time . 
do not use rapid rise yeast as the bread came out flat . 
the remaining components of the case protect my bb to an extreme degree . 
works fine but the cool factor of that blue light wears off quickly . 
the recipe calls for cans to be used but many people objected to this idea . 
item operates just as its counterparts  jaybirds  do at half the price . 
it was a little difficult to figure out where everything goes . 
this is a real professional piece of equipment . 
doesn t have to depend on grinders at store that are often broken . 
i do use it constantly to steam vegetables . 
i installed this touch screen and it worked great . 
the tools we use to live our everyday lives are the basis of those traditions . 
i tossed the phone on the seat of my truck . 
this thing works as long as you get some type of usable signal . 
i will omit their name to avoid possible problems with them . 
i haven t had the mount for long so am unable to comment on wear . 
and this is the kind of the stuff moving easy . 
most spoon sets have small openings so that it s hard to hang them on a rack . 
this one is effective ,  my hands stay clean and it s easy to wash . 
without the extended battery ,  the lg revolution did not last half a day with normal  i . e . 
picked it up and not scratches to the phone the case was still good . 
this means the liquid will move to the perimeter where there are no holes . 
just lift the pan off and the rotator stops since it is triggered by the pan to rotate . 
top rack dishwasher safe ,  and i use it a lot . 
my daughter saved up and purchased this for herself . 
rice ,  frying onions ,  and scrambled eggs were never easier or turned out better . 
i absolutely adore these !  they are so cute . 
i tried alot of purifiers and this is great . 
the only other thing that does get frustrating is the flap over the camera lens . 
it s not designed for light weights to use !  ! caution :  this item qualifies for super saver shipping . 
as you likely know ,  the glass used in the pyrex line does not generally stain or retain food odors . 
turn it on ,  and it heats up in no time . 
the very best things about oxo products are the clever and stylish designs . 
it does make a nice cup of coffee ,  with some elegance along the way . 
and i will do business with them again . 
so these work nice for what i wanted . 
unlike the cheap cooker ,  which needed mitts and lots of effort . 
cosmetic damage doesn t detract from my opinion of them ,  or from the sharpness of the blades . 
i bought this for my wife ,  she wears her bluetooth headset while driving and sometimes at the office . 
i am not thrilled about syncing all my stuff through gmail ,  but so far so good . 
i was so pleased to find something to protect my new beautiful stainless steel moen sink . 
i bought this grill press to use to make hot sandwiches . 
i have been using bluetooth stereo headphones for awhile  few ear bud sony ones  . this one is pretty decent . 
i did the legwork on this one ,  and found this to be the best value for the money . 
i got this for my wife to replace a broken olive oil dispenser . 
it can accomodate a num_num inch pizza !  and it bakes the pizza like the big oven would . 
this is a great knife for the money . 
follow a good pasta recipe ,  and you ll have great success . enjoy !  . 
it looks great it feels great in my hand and it is wonderful for texting or playing games . 
i do love shopping on amazon !  thank you . 
had to have it as my num_extend was a real battery hog . 
the slim size is great and it doesn t hide the iphone . 
other than bbqing ,  cast iron is one of the best ways to get that same seared ,  bbq quality . 
suggested for the serious users that s on the go . 
this product is well weighted and feels nice in the hand . 
he is able to use it easily the bottom flips out and that is the way you talk . 
for only a couple bucks i can t complain . 
what i like most about these bowls is how easy they are to clean . 
love my first set so much that when i saw a huge sale i quickly bought this second set . 
the bluetooth connection is super easy to pair . 
this is a very well constructed and sturdy cable . 
it s a basic device that s why i bought it . 
next you really have to baby sit it on its  initial kneeding . 
my son is very happy with his case . 
it seems to be optimized for oranges though . 
i bought this one year ago to replace a broken can opener . 
maybe it s just a learning curve for the operator !  !  !  . 
i have some pain in my hands and this is the easiest to use of those i ve tried . 
buy this if you want to add a little beauty to your table . 
nice quality and washes us really nice too . 
while i don t recommend getting it for an ipod ,  it s not a total loss for the ipod owner ,  either . 
i bought a pack of three and got it as described . 
it works great for juicing fruit ,  breaks down well for dishwashing ,  as well as storage . 
it turned out a wonderful professional looking applesauce cake . 
i used the knives to cut everything from vegetables to cardboard and overtime they dulled . 
i have many as i love t o change them around  . thanks . 
the only detractor is that you have to do get under the hood to switch from metric to imperial . 
num_extend remove most of the ice cream with a spoon ,  and let the machine bowl warm up a little . 
everything but toast and everything has come out perfectly with the temperature num_num below recipe directions . 
when plugged in ,  my palm pixi prompts me ,  just as the factory cable does ,  to transfer or charge . 
i didn t stop quite soon enough and had just a bit of the grease slide back into the pot . 
what else can i say about this case ,  but my daughter loved it . 
haven t tried other shapes but i didn t intend on doing so . 
i haven t try the steam option yet but i think it should work without a problem . 
i feel secure that they can be in the oven as well as in the freezer . 
i have to admit i m not one to use canisters the traditional way . 
i have a white iphone num_extend and i like the white case with the touch of color . 
the cup is portioned right with a thinning at the top which is what i was looking to get . 
i don t think you can go wrong with this item . 
i only use fat daddios in my kitchen . 
what fascinated me even more was the simplicity of design of this product . 
only one little problem is the hole in the cap is little small . 
thanks !  !  this screen replaced my cracked up broken one and this worked perfect . 
it s insurance ,  right ?  do you ever get your insurance money back ? in this case ,  lord ,  i hope not . 
this little thing i have had for a year now . 
i ve used this three times and haven t messed up any sims . 
with the right tool it makes it easier . 
it s easy to maintain and i like that it s bagless . 
after watching it and taking it off and on now i m very used to it and is very simple . 
it s a nice size ,  but the num_num or num_num cup would have been a better choice . 
i have owned this bread machine for a little over a month now . 
i ve had this popper for years and much prefer it to the fake butter taste of microwave popcorn . 
i think i ll have these a very long time but i would certainly buy this brand again . 
connecting it to a samsung galaxy was easy . 
to my mind ,  the silt that makes it through seems to settle fast enough . 
scanpan cookware is undoubtably the absolute best in every way . 
all things are accessible .  .  . i boiught one in every color . 
the smaller bowls are just the right size to replace my old ones . 
but ,  it works fine for holding smaller spray bottles of cleaner . 
it s tempering in the freezer now ,  but just licking the stuff left on thd dasher transported me . 
it was slightly too large for my old wok . 
i was honestly surprised by the quality of this screen protector . 
i did jumping jacks and jogged in place . 
the lack of a wire bouncing around is a major plus . 
i use it at least once a day ,  everyday ,  for about num_num months now . 
it will fit on the floor of our oven  hidden bottom electric element  or on a rack just fine . 
but it does blend into sauces very quickly and is worth the extra effort for some at least . 
no complaints and i would buy this again . 
it s not excessively heavy ,  just enough that you can use just a wrist motion to beat thinner items  e . g . 
however ,  my product arrived as all stainless steel . 
there was also only so much i could tighten before the screw and bolt side would turn together . 
when we wanted new ones ,  we gave the originals to family ,  and they were thrilled . 
also ,  i ve got a couple of cats who shed everywhere . 
sometimes the stress of choosing the perfect gift is just too much . 
it was a clean  break  ,  i would imagine the glue used to hold it together had simply worn off . 
bento four times a week since i purchased it about five months ago and it s been a great investment . 
material isn t that soft ,  and seems kind of thin but should protect the phone in a fall . 
i was so pleased when i opened the package and saw this item . 
this wheel is so easy to use ,  and you can crimp any shape or size crackers you want . 
i have the phone setup to  enter bedside mode  when charging . 
i let it go to % and charged it full ,  taking it off the charger when it hit %
the new hoffritz waffle maker seem to make much larger waffles with deeper wells for the same price . 
get to tha store and get some assorted goodies . 
this one is a finer mesh and seems stronger . 
thank you so much ,  please get these back in best buy !  . 
bonus !  these clips are easy to find ,  they have attached magnents allowing them to store right on my fridge !  . 
alot of dust get in those spots . the attached screen protector is neat . 
after baking multiple batches of cookies ,  bread and pizza the improvement that the oven stone has brought seems minimal . 
we haven t found that we needed it to get the iron to the right temperature . 
that s over num_num waffles  usually one each morning ,  sometimes two  . 
on a more positive note ,  there are some features i m only beginning to play with that look awesome . 
it is plastic ,  and while my old model lasted for many years of good use ,  things do break . 
not sure how long this guy last quite yet . 
it s small and fits nicely on the counter . 
this battery replaced the oem battery that came with the phone . 
i like them a lot and the case they come in makes it very easy to store them . 
a light mist of lens cleaner on the screen and . 
the white rice it cooked was very good . 
i m not sure why it says they are not for the num_extend
i just let it charge when i go to sleep and it is done in the morning . 
i also have the kenstington  plug in the bottom  type battery . 
two of the women in our sunday school class got them for christmas that year . 
i use them several times a week for storing leftovers in the fridge . 
i used to regularly buy a loaf at my local supermarket  albertsons  ,  that bakes the bread daily . 
i have since given this device to my daughter . 
the only thing to get used to is to push the screen a little harder . 
i happened upon these reston lloyd rectangular covers and length and width wise ,  they fit well . 
i gave up butter many years ago because it was impossible to spread straight out of the refrigerator . 
in general the pitcher is handy for so many everyday beverages because it s just the right size . 
i read the many num_num star reviews on this device and decided i must have it . 
i purchased two of these and a split usb port adapter for my car . 
i cook in it twice a day ,  sometimes three times . 
the first lasted for num_num years of daily use before it stopped working . 
i m normally the sweetened creamer guy but this stuff ,  though strong ,  is so good you can drink without sweetener . 
this works great is still in my truck and it charges up all our devices quickly i may add . 
i am using ios num_extend on my ipad . 
the scoops really come in handy . i ll be purchasing this set in red as well soon . 
i was reluctant to buy it because i thought it wouldn t fit into my medium size grill dome  grilldome . com  . 
my phone still works . for the shift ,  the only real issue is one mentioned by others . 
we even got an electric one as a gift . 
hand wash any nonstick items you have ,  dishwashers do a wonderful job of ruining the finish . 
i lost my old cuisinart blade in a move and this replacement works perfectly ,  as expected . 
its a nice price for a new cord . 
this timer is easy to use ,  easy to see and easy to hear . 
my husband has big hands  he s num_extend big dude  and has no issues . 
solid and strong ,  we have every hook filled with a pot or pan . 
in addition the silicone sleeve extends slightly around the screen ,  just enough to offer good protection . 
the sound is nice and loud that even while on my bicycle i can hear everything . 
it heats evenly and cleans up very nicely . 
does not include audio jack in the num_extend
it won t fit in a small case and it won t fit in a pants pocket . 
or if you just intend on dropping your phone ,  period . 
i wish that it was made by apple ,  just to have the apple logo on back . 
i just love the oxo products and so does my family . 
yep ,  just hook it up and start the file transfers . 
the ratings for this item were excellent and they were spot on . 
you take the mixer cover off your mixer . 
 thankfully ,  i already knew this from previous furniture assembly experiences  . 
i got a lot of compliments from guys and girl regarding the functionalities and looks . 
this is my third rice cooker and by far the best albeit the most expensive . 
however ,  since i have been syncing my palm with outlook for years ,  the data transfer was pretty seamless . 
the four pieces are well made and will be long lasting . 
i travel ,  and when i do travel i have to basically unload my office with cords ,  chargers and calbes . 
also was very easy to clean ,  even around the latch . 
if you ve never tried a stick vac ,  i highly recommend them . 
the key negative is the long delivery time . 
the color  orange  is really cheerful and fun . 
i generally wear out a good quality  kitchenaid  manual can opener about every num_num years . 
this is the best pan i have ever had . 
i bought a charger before from this dealer for my samsung behold . 
i ve been using this wine preserver for about a month and so far the results have been excellent . 
i do like the other models i got at that time . 
this does the job without the heavy weight of a bigger skillet . 
charging while driving also makes it a full day phone . 
i ordered this as a back up should we lose power . 
the clip is strong and made of metal . 
when food sticks ,  a little water on the bottom creates a nice broth for your food . 
the noise cancellation is quite good as well . 
in seconds you have a pot of lovely pureed soup . 
i ordered the case sunday night and received it tuesday morning . 
they set up inflate  easy and fast and deflate just as fast . 
i can easily travel with it in my purse when ever i need a charger . 
it s good quality and doesn t look like prongs will come off soon like other such products . 
i like this product very much for it s quality ,  performance and comfort for the price . 
my last fan died after num_num seasons of use . 
the slot in the back really does a great job of holding your drivers license and a credit card . 
i set mine out on the back of the counter . 
without the unit i could t use my ipad most days and call quality was poor on my phone . 
the snapware square grip are ideal :  lightweight ,  sturdy ,  easy to access and grasp . 
they are also handy for hanging up notes or papers on metal bookcases at work . 
excellent device !  support jelly bean and has an awesome screen resolution . 
bad mistake !  !  other than that my husband and i love this machine . 
they are hard to scratch and don t peel off easy . 
this jabra is about as good as it gets . 
it charges my kindle really fast ,  i use it on my droid phone also . 
liked this mount so much ,  i bought another one for the other car . 
since it is lithium ion ,  it actually is light for its size . 
i really love these and prefer the front open to the back open style . 
i m a down home country girl ,  and i like to prepare my meat properly prior to devouring . 
choclate is another item and anything else that you need to warm up or melt . 
you re instructed to  season  it first time out with some spray . 
no lacquer so they it is food safe . 
they make great tortilla shells that can be filled with almost anything but soup . 
i actually never knew about this item until then . 
pouring of liquids from its wide mouth might prove challenging if you re not careful . 
this is also the knife of choice for cutting the tape and opening boxes from amazon . 
i keep thinking of things i want to bake just so i can play with it . 
i m just not confident about carrying my phone in one of these plastic contraptions . 
and the cord for recharging is extremely short . 
i barely felt any pressure on my wrists . 
there is no way that you will not see a signal decrease while using this phone . 
i broke two bones in right hand which is recovering very good due to my orthopedist , myself and homeopathy . 
this product does exactly what i expected it to do . 
if i can replicate this success ,  i will be using it constantly !  . 
finally ,  i broke down  as did their machine  and got a dyson . 
this gives me num_num drip clips to hang socks ,  undies ,  delicates ,  tea towels etc . 
my first item i get online in my life in usa ,  it came very fast and works great . 
everyone s ears are different ,  so not every headset is for everyone . 
comfortable to hold ,  makes short work of the chore of grating . 
this is by far the best ,  most comfortable bluetooth device i ve ever owned . 
i could probably read the lengthy instructions if i really wanted to . 
the new shark has just a couple of brushes and a short hose . 
it is also very highly rated by a number of cooking sites and chefs . 
which is plus for me !  i needed chairs that my boys could use for several years . 
perfect fit ,  no functionality is compromised ,  high quality soft rubber case ,  adds some bulk but not bad at all . 
this fan helps the whole house and keeps the air fresh and moving . 
it does have a learning curve to put it on but if you follow the directions ,  it s easy . 
the plates say  do not cook oils ,  butter ,  or high fat foods  on the back . 
got this for my little brother as a gift . 
same price as a crappy small electric drop coffeemaker ,  but makes much nicer coffee . 
truth is both bt stereo sets are excellent . 
iphone feels huge and cludgy next to it . 
even stainless steel will rust in the right conditions . 
the oxo good grips cake tester is a great buy . 
its pretty good and is the last official one we ll get from moto as they are discontinuing support . 
however ,  when mine arrived it was clear that it was pre owned . 
don t expect any miracles ,  though ,  like creating a robust signal in a dead zone or clearing out network congestion . 
the bumps over the volume control are very small and hard to locate by touch . 
maybe a separate button should be added in the future for each function . 
it seems that the bluetooth on the num_extend drops out more often than the num_extend
got this for my wife .  .  . she almost instantly dropped it . 
there are plastic extensions on each side that slide out to fit your window ,  so there are no gaps . 
great purchase it looks good in my home and i could have not made a more better purchase . 
the problem was that i didn t own one . 
whenever i find a great deal on a piece of le creuset or emile henry ,  i snap it up . 
i haven t used this item yet because i haven t been cooling much lately . 
the lid seems way to flat to be of much good . 
i can not roast a turkey without it . 
i can t comment on the accuracy of the humidity gauge because i don t have another to check it with . 
the girl loved it !  looks just as sharp as in the pictures . 
i am a pretty strong person ,  but this is heavy even for me . 
you have to unplug it ,  or else it stays on standby . 
these older ones with the round medallion are perfect . 
if i have any issues i will update it right away !  . 
it s pretty cute and serves it s purpose well . 
however ,  this rarely happens and have had this problem with other bluetooth headsets . 
you had to do it outside or you d get it all over the house again . 
this could be the best invention ever ! it works and it works well . 
i got this knife as a gift and had my doubts that this could be so great . 
these cases fit and have stayed on very snugly . 
ran it on high for num_num hours and then turned it down to medium . 
no problems with it ever falling out on its own . 
this pan is a great size for a double cake mix . 
i love the stickers and get a lot of compliments but the stickers are extremely hard to remove . 
the mount resembles an old waffle press :  there s a base and upper plate attached by a hinged arm . 
i don t know what i would do witout it . 
it s rectangular shape makes it easy to fit on a shelf either in the fridge or on the counter . 
depending on what s in the waffle ,  it might take a different amount of time to cook . 
no excess plugs or annoying wires to worry about . 
once it s throughly blended ,  like a shrimp bisque ,  it s a world class soup . 
i gave up on the big hard box to store my sterling flatware a long time ago . 
i helped two colleagues recharge their dying iphones . they both vowed to buy one . it isn t hard to see why . 
i was looking for a vent mount and this combo is a great price and quality . 
this cover is just what i was looking for . 
super cute and as described and pictured by seller . 
i have gotten tons of compliments and everyone asks me where i got it . 
the unit is made of heavy plastic so feels solid and while not crack proof certainly seems crack resistant . 
price is right ,  time is right ,  and it was right for me .  !  . 
most of the water bubbles do eventually disappear and the screen is easily viewed . 
i made the best pot roast i ve ever made with this dutch oven . 
the only issue i have with them is that they are a bit bulky . 
sure boils water quick and easy to pour . 
it requires more effort and maintenance than your average mr . 
excellent quality crystal ,  made in the czech republic . 
so i ordered one a few weeks ago and have already used it num_num times . 
the handles on some of my other pans hang over the heating element . 
my other wire whisk was bigger ,  but it rusted . 
this gets a lot of use and i ve only had to change out fresh batteries once or twice . 
very nice well build i like stainless still . 
i pull it out to use often and it has performed very well . 
i will surely recommend this item to anyone . 
i like to serve sorbet in martini glasses . 
the iphone is tightly held in the holster . 
also ,  does not bake potatoes and other items as well . 
yes ,  the glass lid is handy ,  but i want to use both pressure cookers at a time sometimes . 
for the money this is a great little mincer ,  though !  !  . 
highly recommended for anyone with the desire for a great smart phone the ability to buy it . 
i haven t had an opportunity to use these yet but they are heavy and seem sturdy . 
it got a hairline crack in it somehow and went quickly downhill from there . 
the quick white bread actually is quick ,  rises properly ,  and tastes fantastic . 
i feel the powersupport set is of higher quality and a slightly more precise fit . 
i did just that and this one works perfectly . 
so this is my fourth ?  plantronics voyager pro . 
i got the silpat silicone sheets for baking and heard that an uninsulated pan was recommended . 
very good deal for what you pay for . 
i bought multiple just in case i lost one . 
i can adjust the amount i make from small to over flowing . 
use the bottle then start with your pump . 
i have lost one or two and broken the tip off another . 
it works quickly and seems to be accurate . 
eventually ,  the cracks worsened to the point where it would no longer hold the vacuum . 
they are unbelievably sharp and the blades are ultra thin . 
it is also very attractive with or without towels on it . 
the sound is crisp ,  even on direct connect . 
makes for quick and easy sharpening and touch up of my axe . 
can t remember what chemicals it was that gets filtered out of even straight caffeinated  vs . 
i ordered it up and we are back in business !  . 
not a big deal but sometimes mildly irritating . 
my husband ,  num_num waist ,  and holds his heavy jeans fine . 
allows use of the att network on cheaper smart phones . 
i ve tried so many syrup dispensers all of which dripped ,  and often the flow mechanism would get stuck . 
my zoijirushi has been handed down to me . 
great if you want to protect the phone while in your pocket ,  briefcase ,  or purse . 
the one thing i don t like about them is that the red designs come off so quickly . 
mine was printed inside with some random imei . 
in regards to cleaning ,  always hand wash with a stiff nylon brush . 
i was pretty excited to get this item . 
this is a great little vacuum for the price . 
it is slow at brewing coffee although the coffee comes out pretty tasty . 
i bought this because it was cheap and small ,  thinking it wouldn t work that great . 
they give my cakes a light golden outer edge . 
that could have been avoided with a better bin design . 
i recommend investing in some velcro so that you can attach the dongle behind and out of the way . 
i actually bought num_num to have different places around the house and at work . 
that original unit still works fine ,  but the bottom of the brewer is very rusty . 
one of the reasons i purchased it was that the handle is supposed to remove for storage . 
i ordered num_num of these bowls in fun mix and match colors . 
i really recommend it for any one who has a blackberry bold . 
i waited how many years to buy another can opener and now wished i had done it sooner !  effortless !  . 
got him an espresso maker for his birthday . 
i even bought two more as a gift for my daughter and husband . 
zoom lens has a cover of its own with a threaded area over the camera . 
i ve had mine for quite some time . how to num_extend
it also fits our older blender with no problems at all . 
it is very solid and will most likely be the last one i buy . 
i will also attempt to use this company . 
considered the blueant num_extend because of easy voice control ,  but no fm transmitter on that one . 
the cracks are big enough that liquids slowly seep through ,  so we ve relegated them to measuring dry ingredients . 
each crepe trully took less than a minute to cook . 
those with small ears ,  you might want to find a different style headset . 
the top stays on even when i tested it by turning a nearly full pitcher almost upside down . 
otherwise ,  cooking with high heat may cause food to stick ,  discolor the enamel coating ,  or cook the food unevenly . 
i like the flexibility with the ear loop or or not . 
put it on the phone once ,  but i m too scared to use it under water . 
i checked out amazon and looked to see what they had . 
it provides easy cleanup ,  even cooking and looks very nice . 
i heat it in two minute increments and the corn always comes out perfect . 
there are a few other frothers i have seen with this type of construction . 
these are nice steak knifes and have a good grip and full tang . 
not wearing shoes indoors also keeps allergens from being tracked in so it s a win win . 
the quality of this unit is lacking ,  and a little hard to operate and use this battery pack . 
i have used several brands and they are all pretty similar ,  none of them last a long time . 
i can make it through the day again with my pre . 
this is the last squeezer i ll have to buy . 
i also like that it protects my screen in the closed position . 
the towel is just the right size to cover and retain the heat . 
have used this for over num_num years and it is just like new after many uses and washings . 
this grater is like no other you ve ever used !  zesting citrus fruits was always a chore i dreaded . 
at num_num i have very arthritic hands ,  the more i to hold onto ,  the less pain i have later . 
the pressing part is harder since the mesh is fit rather tightly . 
from my experimenting ,  a proper set gives me an extra bar or two ,  maximum . 
nothing has burned !  i doubt the ir bulbs will last as long as my old ge . 
they were much thinner than i could get them with a knife . 
can also add ground flax as part of flour . 
it goes into the dishwasher and comes out looking shinny and new . 
this garlic press is the best !  you can press several cloves at a time without peeling . 
it was still useable but i was afraid i would drop it again . 
didn t want you to buy it for the higher price . 
the usb port connector allows you to charge the headset on your laptop ,  or othewise . 
the only bluetooth product i own is a mouse i occasionally use . 
tells you battery level when you turn it on . 
i haven t tried the cast iron but from the reviews the grease issue turns me off . 
in fact ,  it s not even in the directions . 
even banging the filter on the trash and then rinsing still puts some grounds down the drain . 
a protective holder is included to keep you from giving yourself an inadvertent manicure . 
though it didn t meet my expectations ,  it did for my husband . 
it s still as quiet as the day i bought it . 
but i have used mine since num_num and it is still going strong . 
pros :  filter does an excellent job ,  allergy symptoms greatly improved within days of regular use . 
i have two of these rascals and purchased a number of them for my children . 
holes in the bottom don t let the juice through and i am not sure why they are there . 
recommend to all looking for a new set . 
it is the perfect size for leftovers and being quite small it heats up quick for cast iron . 
but anyone that enjoys tenderizing their own meat should very much consider this fine tool . 
these are a good size . what i didn t num_extend
during workday i have no control how long the milk stay in maker and it would be to sour . 
things like balloons ,  paper lanterns ,  ornaments ,  banners ,  etc . 
i love the clock feature that automatically loads . 
it is perfect for fried chicken and you dont have to fry the chicken in num_num batches . 
i do not regret the purchase ,  again you cannot beat the price . 
cook with it ,  cool on it ,  it does it all . 
by removing the insert ,  i am able to dock my phone even with the protective case still on it . 
very happy with my order and the savings . 
these have a great warranty and need very little contunual sharpening . 
the glass is nice and thick ,  the knob is textured ,  and the fit is perfect . 
the popcorn comes out just right ,  crisp ,  airy ,  with just the right amount of crunch . 
i bake a lot ,  and have used this mixer several times . 
it was more then what it looked like online . 
we have never lost a seal in an oem bag . 
i cried when my old pizza stone broke . 
with all my kitchen gadgets i don t know why i didn t get one before now . 
you should be able to use these many times over . 
the only reason for four stars instead of five is what i mentioned about the rubber ear insert . 
remember just add it slightly warm to your cakes . 
i love how this one can be used with a round pan or a square pan . 
over all  ,  pleased and the price is reasonable . 
do not overfill ,  otherwise when you put the lid on liquid will get pushed up into the threads . 
these bluetooth headsets are very comfortable and come with many ways to customize it . 
i gave these as a gift with the measuring spoons . 
and it s far and away the best i ve bought . 
there are smaller versions both from this manufacturer and others . 
shipping took approximately num_num days ,  but was stated up front and was worth the wait . 
i have used my food saver marinator several times so far and love it . 
got it over a year ago with a different phone but used it until i switched phones . 
any suggestions on how to keep this rack stable ?  ?  . 
bought this as a replacement toaster for my wife s kitchen and also as a christmas gift . 
i did not need the features of a smart phone ,  nor do i like paying $
not bulky ,  easy cleaning and storage ,  what more can you ask for ?  . 
i wish the frother tip was longer but all in all a good buy . 
i use poweramp as my player  motorola stock anything is useless  . 
i suppose i could have gotten away with a shorter one ,  but this one works fine . 
they are very clean cut and will make great cookie and fruit cutters . 
i really liked an old black and decker that i had used for years and am still using . 
they cut cleanly and evenly and have a smooth as well as a crimped side . 
wow ,  the coffee stayed hot for over num_num hours . 
ok ,  this is making me hungry so i best get back to popping !  enjoy !  . 
i ordered from sf planet  great customer service  and received a cord with sleeker ,  rounded edges . 
my wife makes tea everyday and i ve used it for making starbucks instant coffee . 
the cuisinart round classic waffle maker is the best i ve owned . the heat up time is fast . 
i don t know what comes with the other android phones ,  but it matches the size of the droid s charger . 
i think my daughters are going to have a hard time deciding who gets this one . 
might have trouble cleaning it because the blade is not removable like the more expensive models . 
so many of them were a terrible price . 
works as described and he has already used it to make us some great pasta . 
roomba only cleans about % to % of the home and corners . 
i can t say this for any other flatware that we have ever owned . 
this is a nice pie plate and i got it on sale . 
priced right and comes with a nice diverse collection of knives for different cutting situations . 
great as a space saving option for pants . 
if i tried to remove it i m sure it would break . 
i try not to talk on my cell phone when i m in the car . 
you can find that herelodge num_num inch skillet with glass lidi received mine with no problems related to shipping . 
this mount stays in very tightly and is less prone to vibrations as you are driving . 
it comes with a durable plastic slide cover to protect its teeth  and your fingers  during storage . 
after our electric coffee maker died ,  i really didn t want to spend the money to buy an expensive replacement . 
i recieved both in less than a week ,  brand new factory sealed . 
i thought this would be a good time saver and i am not disappointed . 
after years of getting mediocre coffee from my timed coffee maker ,  this thing has been a godsend . 
this tiny skillet fits in the palm of your hand . 
i have tried many different stylus  the past two years . 
one almost could use some kind of a stand for it . 
i love knowing kitchenaid is a company that stands by it products . 
this phone is not customizable like android meaning it does not have widgets all over the screen . 
i love using this for scooping out avocado . 
i find the thicker phone more comfortable to hold . 
save yourself some annoyance and buy some extras to keep on hand !  . 
we love it and would buy it again and certainly recommend it . 
it adds a bit of weight to it but the protection you get is wonderful . 
thats when i decided to try this hamilton beach oven . 
i use it with a note num_num so it will fit a large phone . 
i have only had this for about a month ,  but it is great . 
so i finally got the real deal  microplane brand  . 
i went to a store in the mall  sur la table  and they wanted num_extend plus tax . 
i bought this because it was inexpensive ,  but it just didn t work quite the same as the old one . 
for the price its worth it and the quality is great . 
the jar is sturdy enough that i don t have to worry about breakage . 
i think it looks really cool and much more expensive than what i paid for it . 
don t misplace your charger ,  it s easy to do because it doesn t really need charged all that often . 
but after several passes through the first groove it was obvious the edge was back . 
this is a godsend !  single cup brewers are not for everyone and my wife is one of those . 
it has its faults ,  but overall its not a bad appliance . 
this was purchased to replace a spatula that was probably num_num years old and had seen better days . 
i have fairly expensive knives that loose their edge . 
you ll really need this extra battery with a num_extend phone ,  for sure . 
not much else to say except i recommend it . 
when you do get the hang of it ,  you won t believe how simple it really is . 
great for anyone who hates microwaves ,  and needs to have hot food for a later meal . 
this arrangement doesn t allow the device to go into a pant pocket or be clipped to a belt . 
alright so it does everything it is supposed to do . 
you must pull straight up ,  and seat it straight down to avoid breaking the charging port on the phone . 
when using google maps on my iphone  and ipad num_extend i am juust a little blue dot . 
they are strong enough and work better ,  plus they are thin enough to get underneath the food . 
its heavy cast aluminum provides unfailing baking performance . 
most num_num quart pans are wide and short . 
i had one for years and years and it finally gave out . 
i love the vintage look ,  and the book look ,  since i am a big reader . 
it s also ideal for cooking num_num grilled reubens simultaneously . 
i bought this as a gift for a friend who turned num_extend
i dont feel like its going to fall out of my hands when in use . 
i was looking for a chopper that would mince . 
i was able to locate a source on the internet selling the num_extend for $ plus shipping . 
i have tried putting coconut oil ,  vaseline ,  and olive oil on the seal prior to pressurizing it . 
there are only three issues to know about . 
i make sure it s completely turned off before storing . 
also still a little annoying that the tank probably only holds num_num gal . 
my hands are big ,  so it is hard to hold on to when you are whisking fast . 
the charging piece just split in two ,  so i had to purchase another one . 
you can t beat the price ,  although the refills can be expensive . 
the design allows cutting cheese without sticking to the knife . 
rather ,  it is fine and makes a fantastic carrot salad . 
lightweight and easy to get off the wall as well as powerful for as small as it is . 
the press is super easy to clean under running water and a little soap . 
works well ,  pricey but what isnt these days . 
i usually love amazon shipping but there was a big fail here  :   the bowl seems to work fine . 
love this set so much i bought two more for parties . 
the plastic is a good ,  sturdy plastic ,  and works well in our kitchen . 
it is like a white noise machine and air purifier in one . 
this is commercial grade high quality butchers twine . 
the actual product is exactly what i expected . 
after reading the package ,  there was no info on wetting the product . 
by the way ,  i use whole organic milk . 
it doesn t do it itself .  .  . you must clean it manually ,  of course . 
i love this product and was a great price . 
second like many other headsets it is east touse . 
a very functional and necessary piece for cooking and serving . 
the handle does come out easy which makes changing positions easy . 
they look just like the ones that came with the book . 
the house smells so good when i m making jerky . 
i need a stylus on a constant basis and have used many different types . 
also you can get some used books here on amazon for waffle recipies . 
i have arthritis and carpel tunnel syndrome in my right hand and grasping is a real problem . 
we re coming up on two years of steady use with this little jewel and very happy with it . 
i m more likely to use my phone s volume rocker due to the finer control it offers . 
it is safe with the quick release cord . 
easy clean up and also stops the smaller pieces from falling thru . 
also ,  it doesn t take up a whole lot of room . 
i am using the chopper for cilantro ,  garlic ,  parsley and other fresh spices . 
then some people say to soak the plastic board in bleach water . 
i ordered this pot  which is very attractive and well built  and sadly it arrived damaged on a friday . 
the fact that the blades are replaceable means you can keep them sharp . 
that makes it easy to keep up with when you re not using it . 
it works perfectly !  i was impressed with how essentially foolproof it is . 
it s too hot to touch for a few minutes after the popping has finished . 
i went with num_extend and am happy i did because it seems like the perfect amount . 
this keeps the heat further away from the stainless steel maker . 
i ordered it and had it in a few days . 
and i love the safety issue of no sharp edges . 
i get kitchen duty so i know it cleans up easy . 
this is an excellent cutter ,  that comes with several different size blade fittings  for thinner or thicker fries  . 
power cord is about num_extend long . overall ,  am happy with the fan .  .  . despite the noise . 
where palm was intuitive and just plain obvious ,  blackberry has been difficult and almost imposible to figure out . 
it will probably never get much hotter than num_extend
the lid fits well but has no rubber seal . 
this is not an expensive coat rack so do not expect that if you purchase one . 
cleanup is done by hand ,  but its easy since the whole thing is non stick . 
i had another car charger but it requires that you have your usb cable with you . 
this one fits perfectly and is well made . 
i still have one unused guard in reserve for when the installed one finally needs replacing . 
you just can t beat the pricing at amazon !  . 
definitely a must buy !  !  !  !  !  my phone is always receiving compliments because of this case . 
this works fine on an occasional basis if needed . 
it is the best way to preserve matches and personal cards when you are camping or boating . 
i ve got some other appliances  blender ,  toaster ,  electric kettle ,  etc .   ,  but this is my only pan . 
it works very good and i love that with the leftovers i just have to put the cover on . 
i bought these as a gift for the cook in the family  my husband  . 
i purchased a few more than what i needed because it takes so long to receive them . 
a smaller board would not be sufficient for my chopping needs . 
but you should know that by looking at it  : p . 
my htc evo has been acting up doing some strange things . 
stays on ear well ,  but the nice heavy duty cabling is too heavy ,  and it tends to flop . 
i bought a second to fill up a thermos to bring to work . 
other brands i have bought always have problems with gripping the food and the locking feature . 
i m a working mom with limited time but big ambitions . 
leather seems good and the price is cheap . 
i have other more expensive pans but this one is better all the way around . 
i have tried this knife at my kitchen for several months and it is a great tools . 
it has a nice weight to it ,  but more importantly it is very easy to use . 
we just ordered another and hope it lasts as long . 
we have a large family so cooking a lot of bread or multiple loaves is a must . 
all these things seem very basic but many of the other brands lacked some of these features . 
i will keep you updated how this little bugger performs . 
i just received this baking stone ,  the the first one i have ever used . 
they give you three ways to charge your headset  depending on your environment . 
she cooks hers for num_num minutes and then makes gravy with the remaining juice in the cooker . 
i love these !  they are hermetically sealed  so ,  i can keep my water more alkaline  . 
i like to keep car chargers around ,  because i travel frequently . 
i made a chocolate flan cake with caramel topping . 
this is a great pressure cooker ,  easy to operate and extremely well made . 
without the grate ,  this does not fit well . 
i ve had this cusinart model for at least num_num years and have used it for a variety of purposes . 
my spoons are now happier . it is well made and feels like a quality product . 
looked for a long time before i found this . 
nice wide mouth makes it easy to put in tall utensils . 
ten thousand times better than the plastic ones ,  so if you are debating between the two ,  go with these . 
this thing works so much better than our box shredder that we got rid of it . 
it is by far in my top three for num_extend
it works exactly as it should and it cleans up easily . 
i m planning to use other cake batter too . 
they are updated in style with a nice blue led ring of light around the controls . 
the equipment is sharp ,  so some caution needs to be exercised . 
it became apparent to me why is was donated in short order . 
the sound is loud enough for cooking out ,  hanging out ,  in the kitchen ,  etc . 
so far ,  i m pleased with the purchase and plan to keep you posted on how it works out . 
buy a couple of these things ,  tools this nice grow legs . 
if any of you droid x users out there have any suggestions for me please speak up . 
holds up for a long time keeps it s shine . 
i bought these along with a set of square cutters . 
i also never noticed any difference in the taste of the coffee . 
you can also use it for food of course . 
it really takes two hands to put this thing on ,  too . the quality in hearing conversations is also excellent . 
fits tight and seems to be made of good quality . 
it did take a little long to receive but it s worth it . 
kitchenaid is famed for its powerful and enduring motors ,  and other hand mixers have short life spans . 
they are strictly used for molds for shaping and raising bagels . 
i have tried other ways of grinding cinnamon but this krups num_num has done the best job . 
without sucking them into the wand and you having to pull them out num_extend
this griddle can be used over a camp stove or campfire . 
it has just about all the features you expect in a phone today too . 
it s used often but not heavy loads anymore . 
my friends and family no longer even suspect i m in the car when i use it . 
milk frothers .  .  . they work and it s about how you prepare the milk beforehand . 
this is a bit problematic since my  almost num_num pound  kitchenaid stand mixer also sits on top of it . 
this is by far the best headset i ve used . 
it is easy to clean under running hot water . 
i had a friend who bought it a couple of years ago ,  and she absolutely loved hers . 
i haven t had to adjust it at all since we first installed the filter ,  so it stays put . 
i bought an off brand and could not get a seal . 
i don t think it could work much better than this one . 
calcium or lime will build up on the unit and make it less effective . 
the only negative is the earphone and charger rubber plug ,  but certainly not a deal breaker . 
i have also used the charger to also charge my laptop . 
i also like that i can purchase the filters in the store ,  unlike the competition . 
we have almost all of the mikasa antique white pieces and love them . 
no biggie though ,  the shipping was free and arrived in two days . 
i got these as a gift and really do like them . 
i would recommend and buy again if needed to in the future !  . 
this is the perfect size for my family . 
my water is good so i learned early on the filters were not necessary . 
sharpening is accomplished by pulling a knife through the left and right angle guides in stage num_extend
he came across this and i ordered num_num of them . 
the screen was easy to replace ,  i changed it for my niece s iphone . 
the metal ones do not keep coffee hot . 
then along came this item . overall ,  i m very pleased with them . 
num_num seconds . much faster ,  generating less kitchen heat and done as quickly as your toast is ready ,  breakfast is ready . 
as funnels go ,  it s among the best i ve seen . 
it really does do most everything it is supposed to in a clever and sturdy way . 
i m eating lots of brown rice and have also made several types of white rice . 
i like mine a lot and it shows no damage after several months of use . 
i ve had this thermos for several months and it s holding up just fine . 
and the price is right !  !  the reason i did not give it num_num stars was the  thick slice  side . 
i ve had this many years now ,  and it still works flawlessly . 
think rich crema , under $ can t beat it . keep in mind a quality grinder is more important that the coffee machine . 
the itorch has in the short time i ve owned it proven it s worth . 
they seem to come off alittle to easy but they stick right back on . 
just don t use it as a shelf for things like loaves of bread in plastic bags . 
the combination price and form factor worked well for me . 
battery life is ,  of course ,  phenomenal when compared to any smart phone . 
i would like to be able to just leave the speed set and then turn it on and off . 
oddly ,  only found at store ,  wasn t shown online . 
the cost compared to any other coffee maker is also much cheaper . 
pretty good product ,  now my mom saves lots of time when she makes dumplings . 
i just recently used this pie plate to hold my cherry pie . 
i purchased these to organize my linen closet and they work perfectly . 
this armband has similar seams ,  so we are hoping we don t have similar issues . 
this one is so light ,  you hardly know it s even there . 
the next upgrade model is a better model ,  but not by very much . 
haven t had the air cleaner long enough to be a fair judge ,  but thus far i am well pleased . 
i feel that it is most similar to the speck pixelskin hd i got from the free case program . 
i m also very glad that the company packages these can openers so that they aren t broken when they arrive . 
it s super cute and was easy to bling out with some cabochons to add my own flair . 
i use this in the field and while driving . 
i ve been a coffee press user for years and thought i d try this method out . 
those who pick up in num_num go :  costly or noisy . 
the price of these calphalon bakeware sets from amazon ,  make it very easy to get plenty . 
it does a really great job at making a delicious coffee and is easy to use . 
the phone easily releases with a one hand operation ,  push the button and the arms pop back out . 
the worst coffee is after its sit on the burner for an hour or more . 
to clean it ,  you just remove the plastic tub . 
this was a great buy for a very nice cheap price . 
here s my take on this one s features : small :  don t expect to roast a chicken . 
if you have allergies .  .  . get this .  .  . if you have two fat furry cats .  .  . get this . 
i bought it from amazon for about num_num dollars . 
very good ,  clear and easy to put on if your careful . 
thinking of buying several more ,  would be great to have in my car for emergencies . 
i read the instructions ,  put the rack at position b ,  and toasted num_num large slices of rye bread . 
easy to use !  easy to clean !  easy to identify !  very good buy and well worth the money . 
this includes my finger  which should tell you how sharp these blades are  . 
also ,  it s very easy to accidentally push the laser button  not that the cats mind !   or the flashlight button . 
best of all the buttons are simple ,  well thought out and intuitive across the board . 
it just does not change ,  still looks the same after i used it for couple of years . 
i use it to cook for office events ,  and to cook large batches of chili ,  stew ,  etc . 
a second dial in the hopper controls the coarseness of the grind . 
that said ,  the sound quality is fine for my use and it serves me well on the road . 
it s user friendly and the foods that i have cooked thusfar are not only healthy but very flavorful . 
we use it frequently for years now without a problem . 
i d say i have a pretty average male head and the boxed configuration worked fine . 
it has ten thousand words in it s data base . 
it made fast and easy work of a big bowl of batter . 
honestly ,  any fan that moves a lot of air is going to make noise . 
otherwise an oil residue will build up on the outside of the lid . 
i think you can use the regular blade for dough making as well  . 
i have been using these filters for year and i love them . 
now cheap price does not me skimpy quality ,  on the contrary . 
while a bit big for someone people ,  this is a very well engineered case for the iphone . 
till that time ,  i am taking a microusb cable to work to charge my phone during the day . 
i have several of these for serving at large family gatherings . 
replaced a green one my dad had had for many years !  . 
if you are using it to cover large cakes ,  make sure you have a great tasting icing underneath . 
then i bought this beauty !  i use it to make yogurt and cheese since we have dairy cows . 
the non stick surface plus the anti freeze magic worked very well . 
i like silicone spatulas that are one piece with the handle . 
after the mug is filled ,  make sure the threads inside the mug are dry before screwing on the lid . 
this would work fine for a different butter than what i bought it for . 
i just upgraded to this unit at work . 
she does not abuse her phone ,  but it seems very well protected for a case of this style . 
my blackberry uses this connection for charging so while traveling i can get away with only carrying one charger . 
it makes a great  as in tasty  pot of coffee and keeps it hot almost forever . 
i haven t yet used it but it feels rather substantial . 
i made the mistake by buying a different brand of coffee maker when my old braun needed replacing . 
i inserted it in my phone and work very good . 
i wish the belts would have come with instructions because installing them was the most difficult part . 
purchased as a christmas gift for my daughter . 
i used this kit to replace the screen of my iphone . 
i bought it knowing that it was an analog thermometer . 
not that it changes the rating but i can now give more detail . 
they are very light and don t make my ears stick out at all . 
on the whole ,  though ,  i d buy this again ,  given there are no other really viable options out there . 
anyway you will not be disappointed with this product . 
the item arrived promptly and was just as described . 
one is hard plastic ,  the other is silicone . 
same on android keyboard . after doing all of that i would also remove animations of any kind . 
can use it for anything !  !  ! i use mine all the time . 
this one has a metal interior ,  the old one was silvered glass . 
many other pans are lonely now in this house . 
still works just as well as i just cleaned my pot . 
i keep the bowl in the freezer all the time with the little parts in it . 
barely a burr grinder ,  but if you want espresso at home this will do the trick . 
i have a pink cover on my samsung phone and they match . 
even though it s only coming through on one ear ,  you can hear the stereo in the sound . 
if you don t mind a nick or two on your blade ,  then this will be a valuable kitchen tool . 
these lg ones have worked consistently and i highly recommend them for hands free music . 
this time ,  i received a whole new machine for $  used ones are going for $ on ebay  . 
no complaints from her lips to my ears . 
my only compaint is how it fits into my drawer . 
the bigger is better philosophy took hold of me and i purchased the proctor silex num_num liter at target . 
we love this toaster oven and use it every day . 
i have wanted a smaller size cast iron frying pan and am so glad i sent for this one . 
it makes the slick phone a little more secure in my hand . 
this will charge my iphone num_extend and my nook hd . 
it s not too loud ,  and its finishing beeps will not arise late sleepers . 
the ceramic second stage puts a fine edge on the knives ,  fine enough to cut paper . 
this is no software coder s or spreadsheet driver s frying pan . 
i am also getting some misses on one of my drawing apps but i don t think that s the stylus . 
the frieling is a fine hotel and restaurant grade product available in five sizes . 
it is a very useful device that should last . 
by having a flat bottom pan ,  its one less thing to thing to hassle with . 
it meets my expectations for effectiveness given the price and given what the manufacturer promised . 
he was looking for a case that was comfortable to touch and not excessively bulky . 
i read the reviews here before decidng and looked at others ,  so glad i chose this . 
the very wide bottom means that the flame mostly stays underneath . 
just as all the other reviews ,  the otterbox case is one of the best in the market . 
it works !  my fridge is textured and it holds very well . 
it is only num_num minutes and worth num_extend
it is extremely easy to turn and the lids come off just as advertised . 
very little in the way of care instructions . 
the belt clip is sufficiently strong and held up well . 
with how much i change my phone cases ,  my screen protectors always seem to come off . 
with this ,  you can use it anywhere because of the external bowl . 
you decide if it fills a niche you require . 
if you cook with a bit of garlic ,  this will make mincing your garlic faster than your chefs knife !  . 
doesn t have a lot of exposed silicon so it doesn t attract a lot of dust . 
what it lacks is a physical audio input so you can attach your num_extend player directly . 
but make sure there is room above your stove to fit this canner . 
with a few tweaks ,  this product would be five stars . 
nice large cooking area; great for a family of num_extend
the cord is stiffer and feels more solid than the others . 
luckily the radio has an aux in so i can plug straight into that with the num_extend audio plug . 
the response of the buttons was top notch even though i kept confusing the volume with the power button . 
we have been very satisfied with this product ,  enough to order a second time . 
rarely am i ever this satisfied with a product . 
therefore i cannot speak about the quality of today s machines . 
i don t know why they include brown in this set . 
i can turn this feature on and off with a widget . 
the sharp peeler breezes through peel without digging deeply into the potato itself leaving a nice smooth surface below . 
i ve never had a problem with opening or closing it ,  or having it leak . 
these don t last forever ,  but i got nearly a year out of it before it started falling apart . 
polycarbonade pitcher is light weight and seems very num_extend
with the duromatic i don t bother to soak the beans . 
i liked this item but it did not work for my phone . 
we use our regular coffie machine and use this frother . 
i would recomend these to anyone who just needs an extra charger handy to top off their phone . 
does just what i want ,  keeps my dish wand out of the way . 
you get two batteries and a charger that is universal to charge almost any battery for your phones . 
but they are a quality product ,  and you get what you pay for . 
figured out which side to put on by trial and error . 
with reasonable care ,  it looks like it should last at least as long as my mixer . 
the scosche is defintely built well ,  feels great too . 
i m used to using a large steel wok on a gas cooking surface . 
i got it for my mother in law ,  she loved mine so much . 
it is also cool it has num_num usb charger port in case you have num_num devices . 
i gave it to someone who could use it and they really like it . 
in response ,  they simply sent me a new lid . 
this timer is really easy to use and clear to read . 
i was skeptical at first to use it ,  but i did because it was recommended . 
saving me time and not holding me down with weight . 
it does best in rooms where there are not many objects to go around . 
these are made sturdy and not flemsy plastic . 
i would recommend it to everyone looking to make their own mochas instead of the expensive coffee shops . 
i ll decide after i ve used it more . all things considered ,  this is a great case . 
bake at num_num degrees for num_num minutes and you will have perfect bowls . 
it s big ,  it s heavy and it works beautifully !  i use it for soups and stews primarily . 
cast iron holds the heat so well that it can t be beat . 
this waffle maker is a great value for the price . 
this is just the right depth and pretty too !  . 
bought it as a gift for my friend ,  apparently she loved it . 
i bought this grinder to grind whole flaxseed and it is perfect for the job . 
not sure if i would buy it for a white phone . 
the pan is made from thick material which means it will last a long time . 
it s perfect for small jobs such as crushing pills ,  herbs ,  or garlic . 
stays hot enough to have several cups hot . 
it is sturdy ,  it keeps its edge ,  and it looks great with my other henckels knives . 
easy to clean as all parts disassemble easily and can be put in the dishwasher . 
i love the larger capacity ,  and you can t go wrong with the solid black color . 
in fact ,  apple should partner with zagg to include one with the purchase of an iphone . 
i will have this for years ,  but when i buy my next blender it will be this one . 
it is great to keep the knives out of the way and still protect them . 
the case seems very protective and fits perfectly !  it slides on and off very easy . 
this is truly one of the best  if not the best  iphone cases . 
i had absolutely no problem with any warping of pans on arrival . 
not just for cakes but other things you don t want to fall apart . 
was a little smaller then expected but over all good product ,  durable and very cute . 
this case is great !  love the design because it shows off the phone s front and back . 
i have been using this almost nightly for over a month with no problems . 
i had them put together in less than num_num minutes each  i m num_num years old with arthritic hands  . 
but other than that get some ear plugs and enjoy some popcorn . 
i have put these pyrex bowls in my dishwasher with great results . 
i am hoping the quality is better than that of the lg tone . 
i bought num_num of these ,  one for each car . 
i use swype on my infuse and i love it . 
you do have to let it cool way down if you want to make num_num loaves in a row . 
i ve had it for several months with no problems . 
we very much like the capresso products and were glad to get this new carafe . 
it broke because it dropped but i love this case was by far my favorite . 
easy to use ,  able to put in dishwasher . 
several cups off by that amount make difference in quality of bread . 
i find that i can keep my salad green and unspoiled for about num_num weeks . 
we use filtered water in it so we don t have to use the included filter . 
i love the even heating and the thickness of the pan . 
there has to be a murphy s law stating that your battery will die at the worst possible time . 
it took me less than an hour to whip up a hundred sugar cookies . 
not as snug as headphones you can adjust over the top of the head ,  but not terrible . 
the toggle switch is a little difficult to switch for its size . 
this screen works better than the average screen . 
ok ,  the handle is different than the classic ,  so what . 
i do not know why the unit is so large . 
leaving these knives to drip dry  or using a dishwasher  will i think stain the blade . 
we have a small washing machine that doesn t work nearly as well . 
my dutch over did come with some small rust stains on it ,  but fixed it . 
it s great to have fan and exhaust options on each side . 
unlike other reviewers ,  i will review the actual product . 
we then compared it to our henckles knife that is part of a carving set we received as gift . 
i seriously think these clips will outlive me !  . 
a small steam vent keeps the lid from jiggling under too much pressure . 
i can hear and those i m talking to can clearly hear me when i m on the phone . 
no sharp edges and very high quality as all their items are . 
it s great for any kind of sukiyaki too !  great and essential kitchen stuff !  . 
this was before most phones had bluetooth capability so i was using it with the included bluetooth adapter . 
like many of you ,  i ve struggled to find a good car mount for phone . 
this is not a charger that you just snap your battery into and go . 
i have three of these for my pantry . 
most are free trials and most are useful . 
this is a very practical case for the ifony . 
no leaks of air !  !  i store my open wine bottles on their sides in a holder . 
i got my order in two days from the date order .  .  . and i did not pay extra for faster delivery . 
when i lost my charger ,  i went to radio shack to get a new one . 
this made enough food to feed num_num adults and num_num kids yesterday  :   . 
i am very pleased with this purchase  :   it is very practical and very efficient . 
for their versatility ,  they are well worth the price !  . 
multitasking is limitedly available in certain situations  such as performing other functions during a call  . 
a lot . i bought this to grind spicy world tellicherry peppercorn . 
this phone does have the n standard also . 
my only regret is that i didn t buy this the day i picked up the phone . 
i wanted one single case ,  not two parts that come together . 
follow the instructions and you will have knives sharp as new . 
love making amoothies out of frozen papaya chunks and frozen strawberries in the small container for individual smoothie . 
but those  flaws  are so minor that you shouldn t let it influence your purchasing decision . 
these are excellent knives that cut very well and stay sharp . 
does everything you would need in measuring food acurrately . 
the antenna is very strong and the reception brilliantly clear  depending on your carrier ,  of course  . 
the kitchen aide was a replacement to this machine . 
this is good for all soft and or gooey ingredients . 
it is of good quality because i live in hawaii and much of the stainless steel rusts here . 
i left a bad review the first time so i m back for a second . 
i use it for everything i can think of . 
i like the clip on the back ,  it seems sturdy and very secure . 
it takes about num_num months for them to get brittle . 
when i installed the new one the same thing was happening . 
the motor is great quality ,  it s nice looking and the stand is functional . 
i ve had it for a bit over a year . 
one blinking light can only do so much . as a result ,  i rarely used it . 
needed a usb cable that would work with my lg cell phone . 
i divided this set up amongst my family members and added it to their christmas presents . 
but again ,  for what it was intended for ,  it works perfectly . 
my primary aim for this device is usage of chat software im+  ,  emails and internet browsing  opera mini  . 
this protector looks good ,  and buttons are easy to press with cover on . 
there is pretty much no product like this that ll hold up to dishwashers without curling . 
it works pretty good and i can walk away from my phone and it is still clear . 
the neckband is especially useful for me because i only wear one earbud . 
it is smaller and honestly looks like it was an afterthought to include . 
most often i use it for mixing foods that are more watery into foods that are thicker . 
the tall lid has three layers of sealing stripes ,  making for a very good seal . 
i ve owned my first one for several years now ,  and it is like new . 
the footprint is very small so it doesn t take up much counter space . 
overall ,  not a bad product for the price ,  but it could use some improvement . 
with my old headset ,  my mother could barely hear me because of road noise . 
the cone shaped filter allows the water to steep a bit longer in the basket than conventional coffee makers . 
it may be the recipe so i m trying another . 
haven t tried panini sandwiches yet but that is next on the list . 
i had major issues with the original battery . 
cheese ,  a little olive oil ,  a little fresh basil and some fresh ricotta and sliced tomatoes .  .  . ooooeeee . p . s . 
i know that my son likely uses his cell phone in the car when he shouldn t . 
i am super happy with this carpet cleaner . 
what i do not love is the short battery life of the battery . 
at first it was a failure because i only froze the container for num_num hours . 
granted ,  the toughest job i ve asked of it was mixing a small batch of brownies . 
unlike most of the rechargeable battery cases ,  powerbear lasts up to num_num whole days . 
however ,  the cutter performs the task fairly well . 
with shipping ,  it is now more than twice the price . 
i like the fact that i can just pop it into the dishwasher when it gets food on it . 
i did not use two lids ,  wash or heat the lid or jar . 
batterys dont seem to have the same life as factory battery but wasnt expecting that really . 
i ve had these for four years ,  and they worked pretty well . 
it would have been convenient if you could . 
and if the kettles are too full it is always dangerous to pull the cap off without a potholder . 
i guess six years is an acceptable run with electric appliances in this day and age . 
they include a pocket clip and a lanyard hole but no lanyards . 
the ring is sturdy as well ,  like this whole set ,  it gives the feeling they are here to last . 
i bought more and kept a set for myself . 
the manual tells you to release the remaining pressure by turning to either coffee or steamer . 
it does everything i would ever need it to . 
on the other you can set it for a countdown of up to num_num minutes and num_num seconds . 
doesn t inhibit the touchscreen either which was a concern of mine . 
the temps in the manual arent ideal for the best stretch in the cheese . 
all the buttons are large and easy to locate and actuate . 
i just received it at the door and took it out right away . 
i knew by its name to get three; one for the home ,  the outdoor kitchen and the camping kitchen . 
i found the same one and am very happy with it . 
it even has a little break to stop the bowl from spinning . 
i bought this to store new suits and will buy additional covers to replace my old covers . 
this unit works great and i know air popcorn is healthy . 
the waffles are kind of small so you really need to eat two to be satisfied . 
i use the small one mostly but used the large item for transferring stew to serving dish . 
whites are fork tenter if not over cooked or cooked too hot . 
debris of this type can also foul up the belt pulleys . 
as long as the containers are cleaned ,  there is a minimal if any staining . 
the artisan goes on sale ,  or it s worth saving up for . 
i love this ,  when closed the cap it s automatically shut off when the temp is high . 
i ve had this press for at least a decade ,  and it s still going strong . 
i bought it to use as extra counter space in my kitchen . 
it fits nicely on the stove top and in the cupboard . 
as usual ,  i had to get creative with a par of scissors . 
no brainer ,  you have to have it and it s very inexpensive . 
very pleased and i would recommend this case to anyone looking for maximum protection for their iphone . 
luckily ,  the screen protectors have protectors of their own  total irony  ,  so the product wasn t damaged . 
over all i am very pleased with it . 
ordered several digitizers over the past year and this is the best and quickest shipped one . 
on the flat side ,  we do veggies and taco shells . 
i want to order more farberware nonstick pieces in other sizes . 
this paring knife is super sharp and comfortable to use . 
i use this to get the cat hair off our oak floors ,  it works great . 
it tends not to tangle like standard cords . 
that s why you need an activated sim card . 
 do a search for  headset  in the android market  . 
i needed something that could apply more pressure than the bottle washer . 
was worth the money ,  kept phone in one place and charged . 
i purchased my first windtunnel canister vacuum num_num years ago . 
it has the bumper on the front to protext the front of your phone . 
the only trouble i have ever had with cast iron cookware is getting the seasoning right . 
i hated cheap tupperware and these are better in every way !  the lids work well too !  . 
the replacement timer works fine ,  and is just as convenient as i d hoped . 
if you re looking to buy this attachment ,  look into the fppa as it is an excellent value . 
looks nice and is not as bulky as similar silicone gel covers . 
making eggs and sausage in morning is the only thing i use this griddle for . 
make some cornbread batter and pour it in the skillet or make biscuits . 
they stack great in the fridge and freezer . 
the original receipt was long gone so i did not include it . 
excalibur had the better results overall ,  particularly durability and heat tolerances . 
the only other bluetooth headset that performed this good was my old  original  jawbone . 
cool color !  i have dropped it several times and no cracks or anything . 
meaning it has a radio that works on wcdma num_num and wcdma num_extend
i tried to find a replacement part for it ,  but could not locate one . 
didn t give much protection but it did look nice !  . 
the rubber seals are a bit loose ,  but they get the job done well enough for me . 
i get so many comments on this cover !  it s so pretty and flashy . 
plus ,  there s a lot less waste ,  both in the packaging and from unpopped kernels . 
they pretty much do what is expected ,  though a non stick surface would have been better . 
i like the size of the waffles and the thickness . 
it was so cheap ,  i bought two in case one was lost . 
you can peel and slice apples in no time with this handy device . 
i will update this review in a month or so . 
perfect for phone charging ,  but not enough to charge tablets . 
the modern look goes great with the lcd tv ,  and tech gadgets . 
it can also be turned to blow air outside rather than bringing air inside . 
my skillets . these utilitarian ,  long lasting pieces of cookware will never win any beauty contests . 
we have had a holmes air purifier for years . 
excellent ,  i can t believe such a reasonable product is such a rock star of a kitchen gadget . 
the thermometer clips conveniently to the frothing pitcher and reacts almost instantly to the temperature of the milk . 
however ,  this has not fallen off yet and i hope it never does . 
might be nice if it would automatically add additional ingredients like raisins ,  but that is not a deal breaker . 
if you are looking for a dehydrator i think this is a good one to get . 
got this for my brother for his iphone num_extend
as sad as it sounds ,  i bought this dish for him for christmas . 
this is an awesome product !  it is very big and roomy . 
the things it can do out of the box is remarkable . 
i use them in my small convection oven . 
i just wish they would port over your voice mail . 
let s be real :  liquification is only for $ machines like the vitamix . 
nice to buy something that is nota hunk of plastic !  . 
rubbermaid is the only one worth using in my opinion . 
next i m going to use this to place my cast iron bread pans on . 
baked goods are the most difficult to figure out . 
it really protects the phone and looks great for the price . 
this prepboard is ,  like its square counterpart ,  fantastic . 
i like the new operating system a lot . 
sandwiches are crispy brown in about four minutes after placing them on the preheated grill . 
i would recommend this product to anyone that loves to cook . 
iced tea also . i usually break things pretty soon after having them in my hands . 
bought it for the wife so she could switch between her work and personal phone flawlessly . 
the secret of most baking is following the directions very precisely . 
i love that it has wheels .  . it s very easy to move around the house . 
i love how you can adjust each fan separately and have one blow in and one blow out . 
after my yogurt is done i just drain it for a day then pop on the top . 
purchased for the remained of my cat ,  not ashes ,  but her footprint . 
it keeps the popcorn in the bowl ,  the main purpose of it anyway i think . 
very nice case !  bought another one to replace !   : d . 
the only problem is only room a day can be done this way . 
it was mainly to play games which required precision like space physics . 
i am so happy i ordered this smoother; it has been a lifesaver . 
i have bought this item a few times . 
looks good ,  easy to use and protects hand while holding . 
it fits in our tub if i want to hide it ,  but it s quite a lovely item . 
if you are looking for a biscuit cutter ,  i believe you will be pleased with this set . 
vinyl padded earpieces are quite comfortable and minimize ambient noise . 
the shape and size is nice for fitting into your refridgerator and it cleans up very easily . 
it is made from cellulose from the husk of beech trees . 
you will still need to initially sharpen your knives with stone or knife sharpener . 
i bought three so they would last a while ,  and i was only paying for the shipping once . 
it does the job ,  and it s been working great . 
the overall design is nice and it presents well on the counter . 
love the fact i don t dont have to screw around with the annoying usb port cover on the dna . 
if you go any smaller it won t be as effective . 
i was in goodwill one day and found it saw it was num_num bucks . 
plus ,  i like the fact that nutrients are sealed in and foods retain their moisture . 
i am testing this product with the samsung galaxy nexus  android smartphone  . 
i love how it tells me how much time is on the battery . 
i have heard from others it sounds a bit muffled when i use it in the car though . 
and the pour spout has been changed slightly too ,  it s opening is wider . 
it is held on by gravity alone ,  which generally is enough . 
so well engineered that you can tell the case was made with thought and complete precision . 
they couldn t believe that i paid only $
i seriously cannot tell a difference between the num_num year old set and the new ones . 
when it arrived ,  i was impressed by the quality and heft of the press . 
i ve tried using soap and water ,  and also windex ,  but neither worked . 
you will be much better off purchasing those items directly from seidio as we did . 
the slowdown can partially be remedied by resetting the phone and directly returning back into the xbox live hub . 
so i guess that s good enough for me . 
i have several le creuset products and they work so well in cooking . 
if only this case would find her phone after she lost it on campus . 
i just purchased another one because so far this is the best case for me . 
the case is a pretty tough and feels good in my hands . 
the insert tray handles stick out of the sides of the cooker . 
glasses with a thin lip seem to interfere less with the taste of wine than thicker  and cheaper  glasses . 
we ve had this  zoj  for a week now . 
i have dropped my phone num_extend high onto concrete and my phone is fine . 
all around it is better than some of the more expensive ones i ve had in the past . 
and ,  you can control the fat ,  calories ,  etc . 
less stress then a peel and stick protector . 
this onereally does the best job of peeling potatoes . 
i like the neutral color and quality of the fabric . 
the filter is smaller than the removable cup so it has less volume as a paper filter . 
now i have one for my car and i love having it . 
there is a volume slider on the cord as well ,  but unfortunately there are no buttons for skipping tracks . 
so storing food in glass seems like a good idea to avoid toxins . 
one of my friends had one of these and loved it . 
it does a good job of making sure the lettuce isn t soaked if you spin it enough . 
when it arrived ,  it had a small chip on the edge of the stone . 
we were at the lc outlet and buying something else and the salesperson kinda talked me into this one . 
thin sliced bread ,  moist bread require higher temperatures . 
came back up to the computer ,  cancelled that and ordered the artisan instead . 
try to beat that at this ridiculously low price point . 
then we each paired our helmets with our phones . 
we use the flavorwave often to grill steaks and chicken ,  rather than our outdoor propane grill . 
i was able to make it work with a lot of patience on my first try . 
the plugs fit smoothly and is of good quality . 
not my smartest idea .   ,  i didn t hesitate to purchase another . 
or to charge it every night . no a single complaint . 
i use this case whenever i m going outdoors for protracted periods . 
usb spec says that shorted data pins are used to indicate a charging source . 
i learned a long time ago to only buy motorola accessories . 
it will keep my garage nice and meat with storage for all the recycle items . 
as a lady on a very strict budget ,  i must carefully research products i intend to purchase . 
ohhh and the lid does not drip  as in no dribbles down your chin !   . 
the handle is comfortable and the brush is the perfect shape for a wide variety of kitchen tasks . 
rinsing out the grinder is a bit of a pain but it takes one whole num_num minute . 
the case consists of a hardplastic shell that fits my att iphone great . 
but overall ,  a very good carafe coffee maker . 
i do not agree at all with the  plastic  feel . 
however ,  it has started to get a yellowish hue . 
first ,  it looks more like a fax machine or a printer than a grill . 
my wife and i have both gone the jawbone route :  cumbersome ,  difficult to keep oriented properly . 
this is a essential item for those who make their own broth ,  gravy and stock . 
alas ,  i searched amazon high and low and read numerous reviews . 
if you have your ipod uncased ,  it should work just fine . 
it also looks great and comes with mounting screws . 
it is easy to use and to clean and makes a great popcorn . 
i have collected all of le creuset s fruit and vegetable shaped cast iron enameled casseroles . 
i ve been using it for over num_num years  heavy use  . 
despite not being perfect ,  i thoroughly recommend it . 
not a huge deal for me since i m not obsessed with the logo . 
we bought them the newer version of the case . 
granted ,  not really great for protection ,  but i m too nervous to use the phone with nothing on it . 
the phone just feels complete with this case on ! they also send you num_num free gifts . 
the wood of this desk looks and feels so much better than particle board . 
it does and this has been confirmed in over two dozen published medical tests . 
they look at me like i m a martian ,  and wonder aloud if i m going deaf and wearing hearing aids . 
not that i eat any ,  well ,  just a few to sample . 
it made cookie baking a breeze !  they all were evenly measured so they all baked uniformly . 
that s when i discovered the magic of vital wheat gluten . 
the body and a lot of parts are plastic . 
it is just what he needs to keep his iphone in one piece !  . 
love how it looks sitting on my stovetop . 
i have used this product on my iphone num_extend as well as my boyfriends iphone num_extend
this little utensil is made of heavy duty stainless steel . 
i bought this as a replacement for the original beater since the coating had begun to peel . 
no compliants there !  the only thing i could complain about is there isn t a large skillet with this set . 
i bought another one which lasted another six months before it cracked and sprang a leak . 
i have now found this a very useful item and its very easy to clean . 
the last one made it about num_extend years before i wore it out . 
just bear in mind however ,  you need an electrical outlet to blow this mattress up . 
this is my second food processor model from kitchenaid . 
we have an upright and a steam vac for the carpets and they do fine . 
this piece has a smaller top that plugs the filling hole after it is brewed . 
it works better without it especially for corners and along baseboards . 
pretty cool . no ,  she doesn t tell you who is calling . 
and once the music streaming starts ,  the jambox does not stop impressing . 
no more wrapping a rubber band around the tongs to keep them together . 
you have to send it in to have it num_extend
i just use a lamp on the table top . 
capitalized words label the country and major cities are labeled in capital ,  smaller words and marked by a dot . 
oh ,  i wear glasses all the time and with my normal photogrey glasses i had no problems . 
i like the fact that it can detach and be used elsewhere . 
the ease of use and accuracy more than make up for the buttons !  . 
i have dropped the iphone a few times and this was a good shock absorber . 
this is a really nice balloon whisk ,  it will be perfect for making eggs or batters . 
three cards fit fine ,  but the fit is very tight . 
this is a great speakerphone for connecting your bluetooth phone when in the car . 
the thing that really impresses me is how well eggs come out . 
to work and i take the much smaller ms . 
i bought this second one for company to use in our guest bathroom . 
however ,  i love the attached microphone and headset for long car rides ,  or walking longer distances . 
i was able to sync it up with both my macbook  running snow leopard  and my num_extend
keeps scratches off my nexus num_num screen but doesn t hinder num_extend
it s magnetic ,  so it will fit any cellphone camera . 
i didn t ask for a refund ,  but i just made a suggestion and the seller gave me a refund . 
i feel my phone is very safe and fashionable . 
i even did tiny matchsticks of carrots and it worked like a charm . 
if you don t have a slow cooker yet ,  this is the one to get . 
i have had mine for all most ten years . 
people tell me they can t tell i am in the car . 
i think the yogurt stays creamier when you add the fruit just before eating it . 
pretty inexpensive ,  great quality and a must have accessory . 
the plastic is flexible enough that i think without deliberate abuse it is extremely unlikely to break . 
it is a great reoplacement for a griddle top in your kitchen and works very very well . 
it simply must be seen to be believed . 
why samsung designed this phone this way is a mystery . 
the voice control is a bit basic ,  but workable for the price paid . 
it has a simple toggle switch ,  no multiple speed electronic gimmics . 
i m sure i will soon swear by it !  . 
i just can t seem to get comfortable in the headset . 
the handle is a nice contrasting brushed finish . 
i don t think any kitchen tool is more divisive than the mandoline; cooks either love them or hate them . 
shipping was adequate ,  and item was as described . 
the hoover num_extend stick vacuum is a great product ,  especially for the price . 
this excludes skype and fring and other phone type apps as they are treated like any other audio . 
the mats that fit on the bottom of the sink are not as much protection as a full dishpan . 
doesn t provide a lot of protection ,  but it s a nice color and has a good feel to it . 
always let butter get somewhat soft and push i to butter bowl so that it sticks . 
i liked it so much that i bought another to actually make popcorn . 
this is a great backup and lasts a long time . 
this has been a great pitcher for filtered water . 
he rooted the phone and put a custom rom on it ,  and all of the issues disappeared . 
after i am done ,  i put the iphone back in the juice pack air . 
it came with all of the necessary cables for the booster power and antenna . 
if you really want to reduce dust and indoor particulates ,  you need about one of these per room . 
for general use with email ,  office applications ,  internet browsing ,  etc it certainly gets the job done . 
they protect my hands ,  wood ,  glass table tops equally well . 
you know sooner or later you are going to drop your cell phone . 
mine were too thick and padded to work at releasing the pan . 
of course ,  the grill is cooking your food very quickly ,  so be cautious because it does get very hot . 
the same thing happened on a friend s kitchen aid equivalent . 
i m used to the problems now ,  but wow what a miss on their part . the camera ,  oh it takes pictures . 
that predecessor cost about four times the amount of this one and suffered a disappointing demise . 
i lined the jars with foil to stop light from coming in . 
i have even left them on throughout cooking and they have never gotten too hot . 
i have had cheap kitchen shears that came with a knife set when i was young and broke . 
as a dutch oven or cocotte ,  it s impeccable . 
since they are so small ,  i was afraid that they may be easily lost or misplaced . 
it turns itself off if we forget to do it . 
drove num_num miles with the phone on the hood of my car . 
if you re looking for a cheap electric knife that does the trick ,  i would buy this . 
i ve been using them for a few weeks and haven t had any issues with any of them . 
i kept it the entire life of the phone . 
this thing is such a treat to use for soups that i m looking for new recipes . 
the case was exactly as described ,  i love it !  simple ,  discreet yet fun . 
i use a finger to guide it for the first twist and then it is works well . 
i had a smaller one of these and lent it to my grandson . 
i used it to julianne vegetables too big for a paring knife and it did that well . 
this does job ,  just wish it were slightly taller . 
when i ordered it i didn t know it was made in china . 
a mfg design that i have to live num_extend
it feels heavy in your hand which i like ,  plus it s comfortable and easy to use . 
this works well with my very old kitchen aid . 
i ve had other devices take up to a minute to pair ,  but this one is perfect . 
a num_extend lb eye round roast was crisp on the outside ,  tender and juicy inside . 
so good that i placed a second order for num_num more . 
never thought i d be reviewing a can opener but this is a great can opener . 
the quality is good ,  better than walmart ,  so i am upgrading to num_num stars . 
i ve read this is the same scenario when conair aquired cuisinart . 
a bit of an art to stick it on the screen . 
i had to order this one online but it was well worth it !  . 
i then used the smaller cup and poured some maple syrup in it to heat int he microwave . 
don t be afraid to buy this ,  it s a great product and a great price and i use it everyday . 
i received this num_num days before said ,  i am very happy with the service and the product . 
my husband just bought it for our anniversary . 
be sure to condition the battery to keep it running smoothly for a long time to come . 
misto sprayers have always been good to me . 
we also got one of the covers for it . 
mine came to me on time and as advertised . 
the cord is a little short but this thing definitely does the job . 
we called the number in the book that came with the machine and they weren t real helpful . 
it s easy to clean and a good price . 
but if you travel quite a bit ,  you will appreciate verizon num_extend coverage . 
also ,  there doesn t appear to be away to dismiss select appointments . 
being a proper grid ,  we lose fewer cookies and slices through these cooling racks . 
there are many more out there ,  but you will cover all the bases with this tip set . 
it sits up happily on the counter when i need it . 
they are much more comfortable than the num_extend and the sound is better . 
i needed additional bowls to add to my set . 
i was worried about food contamination not so much now . 
i did all my tasks and it kept going . 
the used his new pan with for to cook the christmas cake ,  and she is totally satisfied with this . 
i was tired of the leaking spouts on my sun tea jars . 
it didn t used to be that way though . 
you really have to use the machine to understand what i am talking about here . 
no issues with leaks or time it takes to pour a cup . 
equally powerful compared to our small tank type vaccum . 
frankly ,  you should not have anything else in your kitchen if you have anything to say about it . 
it works great on my bold num_num blackberry battery . 
maybe you can find them at a genuine vacuum dealer . 
by far the solid radio exceeds expectations and the kickstand is just the cherry on top . 
allows me to charge my samsunge captivate and transfer data to it such as music ,  pictures ,  and even video . 
there are probably sturdier ones available ,  but at a much higher price . 
this is a typically nice holster from rim . 
you are getting much more shock absorption from this case than you would with a hard slim line case . 
when i bought mine it said only num_num available and the price including shipping was a total of $
arrived ahead of schedule . no cutting or sizing needed . 
really pretty ,  easy to put on ,  stays put . 
we have a ge profile electric stove with a flat ceramic top . 
i size my pans to my cooktop burner size and the heat distribution is perfect . 
i just wish there was a second cradle for the round one . 
still great !  !  still have issue with the not being able to charge with on ,  but other wise im fine . 
i m impressed with it as soon i opened it . 
allows you to rinse with water . powerscrub :  easiest emptying of the dirty water tank ,  which is very nice . 
too much batter and it gets very messy ,  making it difficult to clean . 
control each set of blades num_extend each  separately . 
for being more comfortable ,  call clarity plus the extended battery life num_num hrs . 
we do not use strong coffee and don t mind the noise . 
 maybe their stencil needs repair ?   wonder if the measures will come off with num_extend
this makes one and one half quarts ,  which is just enough for one starving person ,  or six normal people . 
the belt clip alone ,  is worth it; it is strong and has not failed me yet . 
i like that the silicone goes all the way down to the grip . 
so i m thrilled ,  mine works well ,  sturdy enough ,  worked out well for me . 
i was looking for this size springform pan for a great appetizer that i saw on the food channel . 
bright blue led light is annoying as all get out while driving at night . 
i dropped my earpiece from num_num ft and the clip snapped in half . 
if you have several apple products like my family you will love this little gadget . 
i have bought several charging cables and will continue to buy them as i need . 
it is easy to put on and take off . 
it has a cluster of prongs to push out the garlic caught in the holes . 
the one i received is oem for sure ,  and am % satisfied with it . 
it s small and easily fits into any regular pocket or clutch purse . 
if i want to move the phone a few inches ,  crabble will buckle and drop the phone . 
once i bought an auto knife sharpener ,  i got this baby back to razor sharp . 
i got this one based on its looks ,  and good reviews . 
overall good quality ,  just a little to hard to get around with the buttons for me . 
which is why i ve decided to add my own review . 
it isnt as vibrant as the picture shows . 
hope they ll keep making this one for a long time to come !  . 
it holds a sponge and a scrubbie and is very handy . 
we got it to match a bronze shower curtain and it looks good . 
bought this for my num_extend cu ft igloo mini fridge that i converted to a kegerator . 
i get the impression that if my knives were a softer steel it would work good for that . 
i purchased num_num units and both work well  at least these two  . 
and none of them were really for baking . 
i ordered some clear replacements that were good ,  but these are great . 
i hear no background noise ,  whistling ,  interference or other artifacts . 
my husband loves it and has finally stopped buying those cheap cases from china . 
then ,  two weeks later i notice that there are new  bad  areas . 
the thing takes a little getting used to ,  but it will do the job . 
i always ask myself if i could build a product for the same amount of money . 
i can t imagine you d see much difference in results from different brands ,  the knives are what really matter . 
you get num_num decent shelves that are about num_num feet wide . 
i was not able to find any cheaper similar products offered by third parties . 
the color is deep and rich and the patten is pretty . 
answering ,  disconnecting ,  transferring and last number redialing was done with the touch of the button . 
i m getting too much irrelevant information on google . 
i am quite pleased with the six sizes . 
additionally ,  i also use apple s wireless bluetooth keyboard with my ipad . 
tried slicing a pepperoni stick for my pizza and was surprised that it worked . 
or ,  it s nice for things that require dip . 
wish i d gotten one size bigger but don t want the hassle of exchange . 
the board is not to hard to clean ,  and after num_num months of use it still looks nice . 
after using it ,  i d buy it again . now on the name pixelskin hd ?  no that is just plain stupid . 
exactly like you would find at one of the big box stores except a much better deal . 
has room to boil so no mess on the stove . 
that is to say that it does much better than the glass french press . 
it s so sturdy ,  and stands up to just about anything . 
if you drop your phones as much as i do ,  this is the case for you . 
that may take many years ,  but our choice was to purchase pots once  and once only  . 
it is very heavy but i think that is a testament to the quality of the wood . 
the case is made from rubber ,  but looks semitransparent and blue . 
what use to take num_extend hours today took only num_num mins . 
i love this pan so much ,  i want the whole set . 
when i ordered the bunn i did not know if standard filters would fit it and ordered these . 
i like a good study stainless pot with a stainless lid . 
pressing the garlic through requires very little pressure . 
i simply dump the grounds down the garbage disposal ,  wash and air dry the filter . 
they come out plenty tastey . there is a quick cooking cycle that we use a lot . 
the instructions are short and simple and easy to num_extend
the handle could have been more oven glove friendly . 
i use the dvp as a remote to navigate my xbox num_extend menus on the hdtv . 
i plan to use it a lot before the warranty expires to make sure . 
if you say eggs one more time ,  i m buying this for you . 
it seems these days that i need two bowls ,  one for batter ,  one for egg whites . 
no coins or loose keys in the same pocket as my phone !  . 
the stainless steel bowl locks in with ease and the handle is balanced properly for easily handling . 
the cellet unit is economical and very effective . 
as a first time new trent user ,  i m obviously impressed and quite pleased . 
i read all the reviews before ordering this machine . 
and i m a big fan of the sleek ,  modern design . 
progressive international microwavable large bacon cooker is a great product and easy to clean . 
each concentrator can be used several times but it is a needed assessorty . 
it s smaller and lighter than my old one and that has turned out to be an unexpected plus . 
the stability of the phone is best when vertical because the connecting point is low . 
the trick is to align the screen properly . 
the scooper is high quality and will last a long time . 
also ,  it s pretty light ,  so it s not tiring to hold or carry your phone . 
there is a thin layer of oily substance that is inside new pots . 
i have only had one of problems described in the negative review . 
mine shattered at the blade after it fell on floor . 
i got it after num_num business days via fedex smart post . 
the size isn t bad for a large battery pack likethis . 
case is large ,  certainly ,  but as are all cases of this type . 
there is little to add to what everyone else has noted . 
now when im running around i just have to glance in and see where were at !  love it . 
i bought this for her in the event of a power outage or for camping at our land . 
and for whipping ,  i no longer create the big clean up mess with my kitchenaid . 
package came with a europe charger and a cheap plug adapter ,  but had the manuals and everything seemed legitimate . 
the screen protector works nice and it fits perfectly on my phone . 
my concern while purchasing this fan was air flow . 
the others with similar features are $ more . 
it is made very well and should last for many years if you take care of it . 
i am really attached to these measuring spoons . 
durable enough ,  i can even throw them in the dishwasher without fear of fading colors or melting . 
this is a great device and i would buy it again . 
i also bought that big roll of num_extend num_extend tape . 
she uses it for everything from pizza dough to pancake batter . 
needed it for my apartment that wouldn t allow ac units that hung outside of windows . 
but it does deserve five stars because it does what it is supposed to . 
eating healthy and economically is important to me therefore it can t get any better than making it from scratch . 
we have this on our fridge and it works great to keep pens in . 
bread was also a breeze ,  didn t squash the loaf to make a nice slice . 
some people have complained about  scorching  because of num_extend
not much to say ,  it s pretty simple but exactly what i was looking for . 
i make pancakes and sausage and bacon and frech toast with ease . 
this one is bigger as i think my original one was num_extend qt . 
yum ! if you would like your own ice cream maker ,  you can t go wrong with this machine !  . 
the cable itself is $ so for $ you can get a charger too . 
i bought this so we wouldn t keep breaking our corelle dinner plates . 
these come packaged well and in good condition each time i order them . 
this knife is amazingly sharp although you do have to take care of it to maintain the edge . 
i don t see how you could divide it in thirds . 
these cases are smooth in texture ,  attractive in color ,  and ,  most importantly ,  very protective . 
it fits my table perfectly ,  and looked very festive during our thanksgiving dinner . 
pairing was also a piece of cake ,  and the directions were short and sweet !  . 
the cradle is also adjustable so you can get it pointing at you or your passenger . 
this really makes saving a song as a ringtone useless . 
i have a total of num_num now so i can keep the pans going in the ovens . 
it s also very solid ,  a heavy piece ,  it s not flimsy as i thought it may be . 
i am keeping the item and will deal with the static with the hopes someone may post a solution . 
not sure it would save the phone if it was dropped ,  but love the way it looks . 
my wife and i have been using the num_extend flip phones ,  from tracfone ,  for a couple of years now . 
instead ,  waring marks a line on the cup that says  fill line  . 
it took num_num of us to get the bag onto the couch . 
i ll frequently run my the bulk of a day for num_num days before charging . 
it opens up relatively easily ,  and keeps the knife inside where it can do no harm . 
super easy !  super fast !  couldn t have been more simple . 
i just started doing lots of home canning . 
they also seem to last forever so the extra cost isn t such a big deal . 
the  stay warm  feature is handy when you just want a  standby mode  until dinner is served . 
it doesn t darken the screen or reduce brightness one single bit  er . 
i don t know if bananas ripen any slower but for what it was designed .  .  . hold fruits .  .  . it meets our needs . 
after hearing the perils of the bagged microwave popcorn ,  i thought my popcorn days were over . 
this allows me to be able to not worry about what i do . 
just what i needed in the funnel area . 
i was pleasantly surprised at how precise it is . 
i like the adjustable shelves and the fact it can be locked . 
the price was great so i got them . 
a page illustrates charging the icarrier using a wall charger  not included  or via a pc . 
i would suggest that you not hang very heavy rugs ,  etc . 
we went and bought chain to hang it higher so my husband wouldn t have pots in his face . 
this is a flexible cover that has a ribbed back . 
i wash it in dishwasher and no problems . 
throw it away and simply turn the lid to  closed  after pouring . 
i ve had it for almost two years and it looks new . 
i wholeheartedly recommend this vacuum for anyone regardless of physical abilities or disabilities !  . 
i added about num_num cup of water ,  and then cooked with covered until done . 
not using on a blackberry ,  but a nexus num_num instead . 
the second ,  user posted picture correctly shows what the case front looks like . 
there s definitely something to be said for freshness . 
this touchstone door perfectly fits my palm pixie plus . 
one of the sides was warped out of shape upon arrival . 
much easier than dealing with the num_num part cap and seal used in the actual canning process . 
shorter than i expected ,  but gives great control ,  and easy to use . 
it shipped fast and without incident and they were exactly what we were looking for . 
using it with an xperia num_extend and galaxy num_extend
it does the job like the real expensive thing . 
all you need to do is slice the peeled or unpeeled fruit . 
the lid interlock prevents the lid from being opened when the pot is pressurized . 
i ve had one of these for a couple of months and so far ,  so good . 
that said ,  i ve never known kitchenaid to be regarded as  pros  in the coffee department . 
for those who haven t heard the hype ,  shun is one of the most respected knife brands in the world . 
it feels really heavy since the bottom seems to weigh in as most of the weight . 
my husband is a chef so he is used to huge grill areas . 
the motor smells awful when the button is held down for more than a second . 
if you jam it on ,  you could fracture the glass knob or bend the spindle . 
for the money ,  and for everyday use ,  i can t think of a better set of dishes to own . 
buy it here ,  it costs the same and you save time . 
here are a few things i learned in replacing my num_extend
it s decent on the internet ,  and you can do a lot with this phone . 
also the added convenience of a laser pointeris very handy during presentations or product demonstrations . 
each year i have my gas shut off  on purpose  to save $ when spring gets here . 
i had to adjust the cooking times for my microwave . 
i love that it tells me the battery life i have left when i turn it on .  .  . no more guessing . 
this steel just works ,  of course ,  and my knives are always as sharp as they can only be . 
clicks into my wife s iphone num_num and ipad num_num as good as apple made cords . 
get ten six inch stylus pens for almost nothing . 
i ve had good luck setting the grinders i ve used on the middle setting and working from there . 
worked perfectly . the stands are simple ,  and look great . 
most just giving either a thumbs up or citing a few features liked . 
very happy customer !  and for anyone wondering this came on time and the packaging was nice . 
it doesn t smell bad mind you ,  just a little funny . 
my only real issue is that the headset hurts my ear after a little while . 
this is one of the best phone cases ive found so far . 
the only thing i don t like is the  butter dispenser  thing . 
i bought this in november of num_num and we re still using it today . 
the earpiece fit in my ear and did not fall out even when not using the ear hook attachment . 
they re clear so you can see your food . 
the description indicates that this allows them to sit level when empty . 
you just need to keep an eye on the steam as the book says . 
we ve used it for about num_num months now . 
in terms of actually using the phone ,  they re both easy to set up and easy to use . 
it s easy to clean ,  just drop it in the sink with about two inches of soapy water . 
base does make them crackle at higher volume settings . 
my partner uses the medium size ones that are on the headset and they stay in nicely . 
i clean as i go so the kitchen won t look like an impossible task once i ve finished eating . 
super easy to use and it always bakes the bread perfectly . 
but ,  i use this product for other baking tasks . 
he had an iphone num_extend and always kept it in his pocket . 
the full plastic clip is much better than the two part plastic and silicon of the num_extend
once seasoned ,  cook to your heart s delight ,  and then wash with water , mdomypu if you like . 
i m going to get the chicken right one of these days . 
i think she threw the hand mixer away . 
on the whole they are the best thing to ever happen to my scones and biscuits . 
doesn t add a lot of width to the phone but still gives the phone protection . 
if i see to much detail i tend to become frustrated and over anxious . 
so ,  the designers decided to make the spout flip up to stop the dribble . 
i needed a large cup that would keep my afternoon soda cold for several hours . 
my unit had a problem in the speaker but jabra customer service quickly sent a replacement . 
the only disappointment i had when i received this grill was that it was smaller than i expected . 
alright guys ,  this is a bare bones inflatable mattress . 
the funnel keeps the bag clean and ensures a good seal . 
i just slip my charged battery into my phone and charge my dead one . 
and the popper makes a generous amount of popcorn ,  so there is plenty for everyone . 
i just love it to death !  !  !  thanks amazon . 
it can also be adjusted up or down depending upon the size of your ear . 
it at least hints at the design cue with the two tone angle back . 
this is the next best thing to a cabinet trash can that comes with the cabinets . 
battery life is good and it is easy to synch up with your phone . 
one mistake i made is cutting out the hole covers for the volume . 
the jar lifter certainly made things a lot easier . 
it was ugly yellowish like it had been in the sun for too long and it wasn t snug . 
well ,  that did the trick !  it s now almost january and not a problem . 
we have a lot of crystal decanters and glassware . 
that i can wash them well is a huge bonus . 
it is as good as it was the day i got it after heavy use . 
it cooks beautifully ,  heats evenly ,  and stands up to use in the oven . 
definitely well worth the money no problems with the product at all . 
as a short individual ,  i liked the vertical handle which allowed me to pound straight down . 
i use this for holding my iphone when in the car . 
the num_extend fits very well ,  is slim and doesn t add much weight to the galaxy num_extend
this one may too ,  but it will be a lot cheaper to replace . 
used an oxo edge while at my daughter s over the holiday . 
in all cases the stereo sounds quite good ,  even better than many wired headset at this price range . 
works great ,  and much better than paper filter . 
i used this timer for over num_num years . 
i bought this after reading a glowing review of it in some chef magazine . 
and this is easily the best cell phone i have ever had . 
sharp peeler ,  owned one for more than num_num years . 
neither knife is  really  full tang ,  and both are stamped steel . 
i recommend it if your looking for a low cost car charger . 
otherwise ,  it makes him happy ,  so i m happy too !  . 
i like that i make my cup of coffee as strong as i like it or weaker for guests . 
the device is especially good at boosting the volume level . 
i worry that over time ,  it may give me trouble because near misses may eventually make the plugs wobble . 
that is why they give you a lifetime warranty . 
in addition ,  the case completely covers all sides of the phone and raises the screen when faced down . 
its very light and it even came with a car charger . 
she is a fantastic ,  if somewhat energetic cook . 
why should you buy this one ?  four reasons . made in the united states . 
the lid fits on loosely and is not secure at all . 
just pull them out and pop them in the toaster . 
this is the only device i have ever used that doesn t bother my callers . 
would be great gift for grandma and grandpa too . 
once that is loose ,  move to the other corner on the same end . 
it is simply the quietest ,  lightest ,  best balanced hand mixer made . 
i cooked a chuck roast in it and followed the directions that came with the pressure cooker . 
it is also quick and simple to set up and use . 
i guess it comes down to if you like very well made solid kitchen tools . 
 now i have an iphone num_num so i do not have it anymore  . 
i have not used them to test durabilty ,  but i think they will hold up for a while . 
the wired remote will work with apple devices . 
those reviews i read before i placed order were right on the money . 
i would buy more from this line if i needed other sizes . 
with the grill being black it s hard to see unless you shine a light directly onto the grill . 
they make baking dishes that are healthy for food . 
i got this as a christmas gift for my wife and she s been baking bread ever since . 
i tried that once and ,  after num_num minutes ,  i still didn t have any coffee in the chamber . 
it is so light weight that at first i had to check that it was still on my ear . 
i put this up in my bedroom because i have severe allergies . 
with two of these little disc filters i have had no problems with grounds getting into my coffee . 
i will always order from amazon because i spend so much time trying to find this size . 
it s perfect size and i was amazed at how real the flames looked . 
this is num_extend adhesive ,  not much to say about it . 
the crust baked up perfectly in only num_num mins . 
it s smaller than i expected but that is my fault for not reading the fine print . 
for this type of product i wish they would use super glue since they come off easily . 
it s not easy to find bags for an older vacuum cleaner !  this vendor had them and they work well . 
the only reason i m not using it now is because my wife has taken it over . 
i have been traveling with this battery pack since november ,  and have mostly favorable impressions of it . 
lift off the top ,  and you re done ! the only minor problem is that it s hard to dry everything off . 
i have noticed no drawbacks from its heating only from the bottom instead of all around . 
i drop my phone a lot and the defender has saved it from damage . 
i will be ordering more since they work perfectly . 
i have used a couple of different types of screen savers ,  and so far this one is my favorite . 
but don t let that stop you from getting them ,  especially for the price . 
not only are they much cheaper than canned beans they actually taste better . 
the pot will not have to heat up like a heavier pot would . 
for a fairly inexpensive line of glassware ,  i am impressed . 
works perfect and makes devices with limited storage more usuable . 
don t try to buy them for another phone and cut them to fit ,  it just doesn t work . 
i make everything from smoothies to vegan cheese in this thing . 
it will have many uses and a place in your briefcase . 
i might need two parts of one substance and three parts of another . 
there s a lot of positive reviews here ,  which is why i bought this one . 
i need more words for this review to go through . 
i ll keep buying them if they keep making them . 
anyhow ,  i needed something so that i could listen to podcasts  at work  and netflix  at the gym  . 
another poster said he let the lid off for the last minute or so to get the potato drier . 
it is even better than the original one i had !  . 
my almost num_num year old droid num_extend was getting tired . 
i have had no troubles with any drips or leaks . 
bluetooth connects easily to an iphone and yes the buttons are a bit cheesy but they wrk flawlessly . 
i found it !  love that it has handles and easy pour spouts . 
i used to open my shower curtain every day and think that their had to be a better way . 
also ,  the instruction book is really good ,  and the recipes work !  this little baby is a winner . 
that goes with anything involving the handling of your phone . 
i am charging it now so i don t know how long it will last . 
up until now i didn t have a pot tall enough to do larger jars . 
the preseasoning on it was more than sufficient . 
as far as performance ,  a great vac at a great price . 
they re narrow ,  they re ergonomic and comfortable to use ,  they re sharp ,  they retain their edge really well . 
i bought this to replace my wife s broken screen . 
soft tpu case slips right on and can easily removed again for washing . 
excellent compact easily used earphone for iphone and ipad applications . 
it s perfect for those of us who don t have smartphones or a headphone jack . 
it cooks rice beautifully if you do it correctly and pay attention to the heat setting . 
like someone wrote invert the unit when finished and the cap will hold the over spill . 
unfortunately the one i got was plain and pink and diminished the impact of cutters . 
not as aesthetically pleasing as the more dainty cables . 
you will be very happy with this opener . 
i bought this for my son who has an incredibly small bedroom . 
i actually managed to get the copper for peel off . 
looks good in my kitchen as i have stainless and black appliances . 
this time the bottom of the case fit as snugly as the top of the case . 
the silver lining part just fell right off . 
the lids are not completely airtight but they seal well enough that food does not dry out . 
this is perfect for those touch up jobs on clothes that need the extra flattening . 
i always start with the meat room temperature all the way through as it cooks quick then . 
the helper handle is great . clean up is easy . 
and the plate sizes aren t the least bit deceptive in my opinion . 
motorola has a winner in this new model . 
it s a nice ,  shiny stainless steel with a tight fitting lid . 
when i bump from the side ,  the steamer merely rotates and doesn t spill . 
plus ,  it has the safety feature of automatic turn off after the time has expired . 
in all other respects ,  the pans are equivalent . 
i dont recharge it till the night when i go to sleep . 
this is however the best one i tested . 
it s like i have an ac outlet in my bag . 
i m a little hard of hearing and i can hear this thing great . 
i really like these so well that i ordered more . 
i am comparing this new num_extend to the num_extend
i purchased this as a gift for someone . 
it does a great job on my well water ,  which was good to begin with . 
this is the best indoor grill i have ever had . 
haven t had it long enough to know if it will fall apart down the road yet . 
oh this is so wonderful to have for storage in a small place . 
p e r f e c t find . 
we both charge our phones  an lg and samsung  and her itouch constantly . 
i have made it more consistently ,  and with less mess ,  since getting this rack . functionally ,  this works quite well . 
the machine brews an excellent pot of coffee every morning . 
the complaint of some about the heat this puts out wasn t a problem . 
looking forward to baking in the holidays and not having my entire kitchen table and countertop covered in cookies !  . 
i ve had very little leakage with this and the quality has been satisfactory . 
it has a small light that locates the usb slot for me in the dark . 
my room is much less dusty with this in it . 
num_extend side black button can also be used to stop the spinning at any time . 
i bought it as a low cost alternative to an omelet pan and it has far exceeded my expectations . 
it is in essence a dustbuster with an attachment and power cord . 
the product met all of my expectations and i m glad i purchased both the baguette and french bread pans . 
you can either twist and pusle it ,  or twist and leave it to blend on its own . 
i use it all the time to clean my counters . 
i have a doctor who does not know the meaning of the word punctual . 
sometimes ground beans defy gravity and scoot out and over the counter . 
shows several types of simple ,  easy to perform techniques . 
i love the finish on this pan and the way it is made i know it will last . 
this is an a+ seller and product . thank yousincerelyjodi . 
the tea lid is just plain clever ,  though the screen is coarse as noted in other reviews . made in china . 
not a flush perfect fit but the quality is great . 
aside from this little flaw ,  it s been a very wonderful little utensil . 
but ,  i didn t read those until i broke my first pitcher . 
puts your counter top mixer  undercover  and out of sight . 
i know she ll have it for the rest of her life . 
i own two of the duo s and use them weekly as pressure cookers and more often as stovetop pots . 
and have always recieved good products ,  fast shipping and good customer service . 
great product fits on the phone perfect looks like the original would buy another if needed . 
it comes to a boil faster than the big canner for quarts ,  too . 
all of the cut outs for the ports are where they should be and i have no complaints . 
love that !  and they made it easier to slide my fingers on the screen to unlock it . 
wished i had of ordered this a long time ago . 
i wish the bottom part didn t rotate because it s hard to maneuver and it gets in the way . 
when i need new glasses i now just go straight to luigi bormioli s michelango masterpiece collection . 
it is as it says ,  very slim and convenient . 
throughout the year i ve owned them ,  i have yet to run into any problems . 
i bought this a few years ago for my iphone num_extend
i would buy it again and may do this sooner too !  . 
the lid hold enough bits when filling it . 
i have parrots in the house ,  their parrot food creates pantry moths which can get into the cereal . 
really ,  the swype on this is the absolute easiest to use of any phone i have tried it on . 
i rarely have to clean my microwave because i never get splatters . 
my son laughed when we took the breville oven out of the box . 
i just moved the coat rack back when the room was complete . 
the case itself is nicely built and makes a great alternative . 
her mom uses one that is very similar . this is definitely cast iron ,  but it weighs less than num_num lbs . 
one of them upgraded to the motorola triumph and one upgraded to the htc wildfire . 
i have been married over num_num years and i have never had a bowl like this one . 
i can t wait to use them this holiday season . 
everything has its own usb cable ,  micro ,  mini ,  etc . 
i m going to buy a couple more for gifts . 
it actually sits in your ear comfortably with no ear hook . 
i ve used several designs over the years and this one is absolutely ,  hands down ,  the very best design . 
when a teen has a phone they need a safely net ,  or body armor . 
this towel grabber sticks to the fridge  sticky tape on the back ,  no need to drill holes  . 
wouldn t sync with my wife s ipod touch though ,  not sure why not . good price here ,  about half of the msrp . 
note :  the gasket goes between the blade and the jar . 
since i own so many gadgets it s just one of those necessities . 
stays on great ,  and is super cute ,  also came very quick  like num_num days  . 
i gave it an extra sharpening since my dad would be carving and he s a knife snob . 
it s great ,  considering the price ,  though it does have flaws . what i num_extend
i bought two sets of these ,  for only $ and it has changed the way i chop food . 
its superior feature ,  to me ,  is providing a nice secure grip and it s light weight . 
nice quality cable and the white color identifies it as an apple accessory at our house . 
i hand wash and leave on the counter to air dry . 
that s not ideal . other than that ,  again ,  it s a hamper . 
this popper lets you control how much fat and salt you use and that alone makes it worthwhile . 
while this item wouldn t win any beauty awards ,  this coffee urn is a solid performer . 
it feels almost rubber but it s very hard . 
it even makes the touch screen easier to navigate because of the coating . 
all in all ,  for having it over four years ,  it s a great purchase . 
great housewarming or bridal shower gift too . can t miss with this !  . 
i love this thing ! adding after num_num weeks :  the filter gets clogged easily and you can lose suction . 
this is a quality product at a great price . 
speed dials also appear as individual buttons on the screen on the second page . 
it will be a nice edition to your kitchen . 
its much simpler than the previous solution of using a towel or oven mitt . 
num_num inches keeps the hot away from my hands . 
other measuring cups we own are generally cylinder or modified cone shaped . 
so i quickly swapped out batteries and was up and running again . 
we were looking for an inexpensive set for everyday use to place some that had become scratched and stained . 
now the tricky part is choosing which color s  are best for you . 
i have ,  however ,  used it several times in rental cars on road trips and it s perfect for that . 
very neat ! video num_extend megapixel carl zeiss lens is the best i ve ever seen on a phone . 
in fact with the iphone num_extend this nearly doubled the life of the iphone num_extend
i love that they are so easy to fill and empty and that the carpet dries so quickly . 
i had zero issues with it and it truly cut my tomato sauce canning time by more than half !  . 
i especially like the ability to recharge my phone at the same time . 
it s been about num_num months since i put it on . 
it works with the sony playstation num_num also . 
this device only works on num_extend g  edge ,  wap ,  num_num mhz and num_num mhz signals  . 
the device itself also charges fast so i can grab itand go when i need it . 
for christmas i received this portable battery and it has already saved me on numerous occasions . 
i use paper towels and wipe it off . this is a beautiful and impressive piece of cookware . 
i also tried very thin slices of an overripe mango . 
it has quality of simply calphalon so i don t expect it to be heavy like calphalon commercial line . 
it is large enough but not over sized . 
would i trust my $ phone in anything else ?  absolutely not . 
the tote that comes is plain but that s not what i was worried about .  i have found both mr . 
once it s on to my liking ,  i left the protector on for num_num hours before use . 
we like that they are unbleached ,  less chemicals is always better for the body !  . 
i am having no problem with the doors ,  as some people reported . 
much faster than a small hand peeler and a paring knife . 
i really love that the machine has a clean water rinse to get out all of the soap . 
has some little textured inserts on the sides that help you hold it . 
i only bought this because the one we wanted was out of stock .  .  .  . but i m glad i did . 
i also wondered how healthy it could be . 
i tried one of these num_extend batteries and ended up buying another . 
it sucked up so much dirt that i had to empty the cup twice . 
i like oxo products so i decided to get this one . 
now ,  if you are home brewing in order to save money on beer ,  then this kit isn t for you . 
the inside is soft which i thought it was cool . 
it s easily cleaned though  just wipe it with a cloth or on your shirt sleeve  . 
gave as gift to my friend and she is happy with it !  . 
wet items are not good being stored ,  so drying this particular appliance is important . 
it s small enough that i can leave it on the counter all the time . 
this is the professional version of presto s salad shooter ,  which includes more blades and addapters in the kit . 
anything that can tear out of the relatively fragile wrap is likely to poke through . 
this product produces a moist flaky texture to your salmon ,  sea bass ,  excellent for cod . 
would suggest if you are looking for this item look no more . 
i love these !  made cornbread ,  poppyseed cake ,  and red velvet in these recently . 
as a point of reference ,  it can process a num_num oz . 
drawback is there are no user replaceable batteries . 
i love the way it organizes out messy area of our home . 
looks a bit strange if you re the type that wears one around in public . 
very sturdy ,  easy to use and a steal for the price !  . 
had to guess and ,  while this one works ,  it is larger than what i ideally wanted . 
so i am perfectly happy with this very attractive little toaster . 
this product is harder to use than i thought it would be . 
i have no issue whatsoever with this headset . 
i am very careful not to get anything in the gears though only because of previous reviews . 
works fine ,  but does not snap in and out of holster as smoothly . 
i really like these glasses ,  and use them daily outside . 
the audio from music and video is amazingly good . 
it prevents rust and makes the pot or pan easier and easier to clean the more it s used . 
it needs to connect to the google server to complete a voice request . 
i used this today and it made fabulous waffles with no sticking whatsoever . 
i have no complaints about its quality or looks . 
we purchased the oxo good grips medium cookie scoop to test . 
the drawers are a perfect size and it looks really nice . 
how long do they last . all these makers claim to use leather . 
orville redenbacher seems to give the fewest unpopped kernels . 
i bought this solely for transporting my chef s knife to other places from home . 
i can chop for hours with this knife . 
our room get incredibly hot in the summer and the ceiling fan does next to nothing . 
it has worked excellent for me so far . 
works great on stairs ,  area rugs ,  hardwood floors . 
it s not that the tang has been tapered to reduce weight or change balance . 
we use this pan and the one with holes in it  also nordic ware  almost daily . 
i don t heat stuff up in the mornings ,  so so far i haven t tested the warmth retention . 
other than that switch hole business ,  its perfect !  . 
ordered the black with pink otterbox case and received a pink with black case . 
because it is nonreactive ,  this pitcher is great for serving juices and sangria . 
for the price this cover is very nice . 
the coffee actually tasted plasticky ,  even after multiple uses and cleanings of the machines . 
fun to browse and in many ,  many num_extend
first of all ,  you really have to vacuum first and clean the receptacle before washing . 
i use it every moning to make my bacon . this is a quick clean up life saver . 
it looks like something out of a jim carrey movie . 
this is more comfortable since it doesnt float behind the head causing physical interference . 
i m very reluctant to actually use it to cook . 
so far ,  much improved air quality  i m a smoker  and easy cleaning . 
you don t even need to peel the cloves . 
i never used the little spoon it comes with . 
isn t there a place in the usa that can bend metal to make these things ?  ?  . 
the nonstick surface is super slick so food just slides right off . 
like i said ,  enough room for a blootooth headpiece . 
they are thick and hold up well when baked . 
thinking about getting a smaller one too  :   . 
also the floor tool is essential if you are doing floors . 
the baskets ,  lid and oil container are dishwasher safe . 
the pyrex set is much better in that aspect . 
this pan is just thick enough to have good ,  even heat retention ,  but yet not be too heavy . 
shake it up and let it set a few minutes . 
or num_num pts .  ,  but with an additional rack ,  you can process two layers of pt . 
the remaining three seem to work just fine . 
works great ,  it s used all the time and we love it . 
obviously ,  it can only handle relatively small pizzas ,  but it works great for my needs . 
the earhook is so flimsy that it came apart in the first num_num minutes . 
i also have the nordicware half sheet and this pan actually cooks quicker than the nordicware . 
great for everything from stir fry to hamburgers !  . 
this item is actually bigger than i expected . 
this is a great protector for my new favorite gadget !  . 
the information in the quick start guide was sufficient to have me up and running with the basic features . 
they are not expensive to run ,  and surprise you with how much heat they put out . 
i just eat them straight from the bowl . clean up the bowl ,  i m good to go . 
it is actually able to recharge some camera batteries as well as the battery for my logitech universal remote . 
one thing we learned is that once it gets hot ,  turn down the heat or everything will stick !  . 
i just got my blender and used it for the first time . 
suffice to say i find myself using this tool a lot . 
but i got tired of chopping everything small even before putting it in the chopping bowl . 
i didn t think i would be so pleased and use this so much . 
corelle is my favorite brand for everyday dishes . 
i now wish i had purchased the num_num inch one . 
at this price ,  i think it will be wiser to buy another for the spices . 
i bought this knife at cook s illustrated recommendation and the best price was on amazon . 
the only differences you need to account for is the thickness and fat content of the bacon . 
i also ordered cases of ramen noodles and easy mac ,  and had starbucks via packs sent from home . 
i have owned both the senseo and keurig single cup coffee makers . 
maybe i just got a strange batch . i recommend buying these filters from amazon for their great price !  . 
i use it for homebrewing and somehow i managed to drop it into boiling wort twice today . 
there is a line but not very obvious to mark the fill line . 
a great way to save calories for all types of food for the application of olive oil . 
i loan it to others in need almost as often as i use it . 
received the package ontime and packaged very well . 
so ,  a set of headphones with a mic on them became a convenience that i wanted . 
the cover is scratched up but the phone still looks new . 
so my new little sony device won t connect to my sony computer . 
everything was done in about num_extend for a beginner like me . 
i will order them again when we need them . 
it sounds more complicated than what it actually is ,  as actual assembly takes less than a minute . 
what appears like a hole in the center from the photo is only an indentation for the mixer head . 
worth it !  !  adds a nice touch to the iphone !  . 
have never used the divider ,  but it looks like it would work just fine . 
mine has been used regularly over num_num years and going strong . 
i use this sweet little sucker every other day . 
if anyone is interested in buying them don t hesitate ,  they are worth it . 
i had bought num_num batteries and the first one i used was warming my phone too much . 
i ve since bought another one for another friend for christmas ,  i would highly recommend this rice cooker to anyone . 
no ,  it doesn t stick to a magnetic knife holder . 
i keep the caste iron wok on this ring . 
if you d like to give it a try ,  you can t go wrong with this beautiful yosemite model . 
this is wonderful if you have a small kitchen  or even if you don t  . 
you can take three stabs at it  roughly  before the wetness starts evaporating . 
it s coated with a while vinyl which means it won t scratch my sink . 
these are excellent night stands for the price ,  you can t go wrong !  !  i would highly recommend . 
this is probably my favorite gadget in my entire kitchen . 
the cheaper one was softer metal  like a toy  and very cheap looking pins . 
you can t let the yeast touch the liquid . 
can a good knife change your entire life ?  maybe not ,  but it can change your kitchen experience . 
she said nordic ware always has excellent products which they stand behind %
i tested this with three different coffee makers and filters ,  using the same coffee and water . 
there was nothing wrong with the first pair some take them . 
he says they are comfortable and hold a charge . 
i raised the can opener higher ,  and it finally caught . 
it s a no brainer to use . better than electric in my opinion . 
the speakerphone is loud enough it can work fine from there . 
i got this for a friend who was in the habit of having her father sharpen her knives . 
it is a little lighter than the picture shows . 
hasn t dulled over all these years of constant use . 
i purchased these for my aunt ,  who has recently started baking professionally in spain . 
i didn t want to lug around a charcole grill and supplies ,  or a little propane grill and tank either . 
it has protected my phone from several accidental falls . 
tremendous product if you have a touch screen computing item . 
i ordered one for my iphone num_num because i am clumsy . 
if you re reading my review ,  take notice that multiple num_extend parties sell this exact same item . 
it is not dramatically better than a scoop that has less heat conduction than the aluminum and refrigerant construction . 
the best thing i love about this charger is the size . 
this was her first new knife in num_num years  used to replace some aging cutco knives  . just remember though . 
the usb charger is small and doesn t get in the way . 
has volume buttons on the top and bottom of earpiece for control . 
i purchased this small skillet for cooking eggs only . 
you can customize the lock and theme to your phone without rooting !  complements of num_extend and lock bot pro . 
after researching various grinders pretty thoroughly ,  i ultimately decided on the capresso num_extend infinity burr grinder . 
works well to improve the signal strength for our mifi in our motor home . 
pretty good feel ,  great edge holding ,  and super simple clean up . 
my facebook ap downloads once ,  and the contact pics stay the same . 
a bit of a let down for a product with the  pro  moniker . 
but for the price it was worth it . 
i ordered them two days ago and already revieved my screen protectors . 
i suggest something else to get the juice level to where you need it for ipad use . 
works well and actually survived the dish washer . 
so this makes it great in the summer time . 
i dropped my phone num_extend and the screen chipped behind the rubber where the volume switch is . 
i am very happy with my purchase so far . 
i was happy to find these num_num x num_num inch pans for a reasonable price . 
camera cutout looks small but does not block view at all . 
i saved the box for this one to keep all the parts together . 
i use it to chop garlic all the time ,  and making little batches of pesto is so easy . 
came ontime . very nice , work great , looks great , worth it for price . im ordering more . 
i will say ,  the balance seems to be slightly off . 
a good charge will last you a nights cooking ,  and that aughta be good enough . 
the dried pasta easily slides off the num_extend
my family really enjoyed the cute little doughnuts made in this pan . 
overall ,  a very good set of spoons ,  and another quality oxo product . 
for the size and price ,  it would be impossible to find a more powerful fan . they are ,  however ,  quite loud . 
just recieved item ,  paid $ with free shipping . 
yes ,  the plug and filter doesn t come through the hole . 
this deep fryer is a nice size ,  has an accurate thermostat and it fully submersible . 
i m pleased to say that the headset performs way better than i expected it to . getting started is a breeze . 
so a scale with a detachable plate will tend to live longer . the escali alimento has covered buttons . 
inexpensive and has battery level indicator . cons :  only chrges internal batteries to % capacity on solar alone . 
i hope it lasts but sometimes these electronic cords die quickly . 
coffee first ,  similar style and the caraffe was impossible to open . 
i heard a couple of dead spots but i m not sure that was the headset . 
that kept clouding over and causing all sorts of problems . 
nice pots and pans ,  pans suffer from  sticking  problem .  .  . on the whole it was a good buy for the price . 
this makes it difficult to  flute  your crust . 
i like the shape and look of this grinder . 
probably one of the best purchases i ever made on amazon . 
it is easy to get on and off and still fits very snuggly . 
aside from that ,  this machine has turned me into a baker and that was a miracle all in itself . 
great materials and great look ,  can not go wrong . 
a high quality pitcher which is much nicer than cartons and plastic bottles . 
only one real use ,  but i will update as necessary . 
a great buy this time and less frustration . 
 the stainless version s ball joints i saw in the store were far smoother . 
all of this worked just right for me and i was up and running in a flash . 
its kind of flimsy but still decent qualtiy . 
i use it so often i leave mine on the counter rather than storing it . e . m . 
you may need more than one if have many pans . 
this is my second cuisinart food processor ,  my old one is num_num years old and i wore it out !  !  . 
it comes with num_num very handy microfiber cleaning cloths ,  one for each screen protector . 
fits good since it makes four waffles and don t have to wait for just one every time . 
if you are new to it ,  you will love it too . 
as with all wilton products ,  this spatula get the job done well . 
you are gonna need an outlet right where you intend to use it . 
i did replace the cup because it is plastic on the inside  insulated ; i don t like drinking from plastic . 
these shapes are so cute ,  i couldn t pass them up . 
great sound ,  long battery life ,  good range ,  very comfortable . 
but i think im going to look for something sturdier . 
the protectors are easy to get on and come with a screen cleaner ,  directions ,  and an applicator . 
was looking for one with a wooden handle and finally found it . 
works perfect !  no complaints at all ,  would buy for multiple cars . 
they however contacted me and have me a full refund !  couldn t ask for better service ,  definitely satisfied !  . 
but that doesn t bother me because i don t keep it on the hanger anyway . 
don t bother trying to find a suitable cleaning brush ,  the mesh is just too fine . 
it s a very good compact grill ,  it serves its purpose very well . 
very powerful for it s size but the db noise level can be piercing . 
in light of all that ,  i felt compelled to bump up the stars . 
i use this on some of my upholstered furniture and it picks up the cat fur perfectly . 
and since they live in other states ,  we got free shipping through amazon ,  too . 
this is the most expensive pan i have ever bought . 
for some reason the battery pack did not work at first . 
i m a responsible adult ,  i can make sure the tub doesn t overflow . 
does not work with samsung fascinate . also charged all of my plantronics bluetooth headsets . 
none of them perform as well as this very inexpensive cast iron pan for stove top frying or searing . 
hardly a big deal ,  but worth mentioning for those who like to color coordinate . 
they are solidly constructed and have the comfortable grips that are part of all oxo gadgets . 
i have other large cast iron pieces that feel like your wrist is breaking when you lift them . 
i use it to charge my samsung galaxy ii s off my computer . 
we have always used a blade type grinder for our coffee in the past . 
the oval shape accommodates the items that i like to cook low and slow . 
the probe and cable have a higher temperature rating than any others that i know of . 
i bought the glass top to go with mine just because i liked the way it looked . 
this is the way to get a truly wonderful cup of coffee . 
it is good for someone like me who is not good at deep frying . 
we have four of these for hanging pans in the pantry . 
right price ,  you have to be patient and buy these in advance since they come from china . 
my cookies have been lighter and softer ,  my bread has been softer and not nearly as tough . 
i decided to switch to a toaster and am very happy with this toaster . 
slightly more than i wanted to pay for a silverware tray ,  but happy with this purchase . 
so i am getting a stainless one this time to be safer . 
you will see no bubbles and it will look flawless . 
i like the way it fits on my stove . 
wonderful ,  use it in conjunction with the reynolds sealing kit . 
this case helps me run my day smoothly without having to worry about my phone dying . 
this arrived fast and in secure ,  clean packing . 
it keeps my iphone at the perfect angle for viewing . 
i have had a pair of these joyce chen scissors for num_num years . 
i wouldn t get this if kids can get to it easily . 
they re great but looking back we should have bought the shun set . 
it works very well and has come in handy when needing it for all our grilled food . 
there s no seams ,  so there s no way that this ladle can fall apart . 
i don t notice any hotspots on the bottom ,  as i boil my sap . and all that ,  for ten bucks !  . 
i just used my pot for the first time and have to say that i love it . 
i ve only had the thermometer for num_num days and it s working well as best as i can tell . 
the pots and pans look nice also ,  hanging up . 
all i have to do is scoop some out and drop it into whatever i m stir frying . 
i decided the silicone would be easier to clean and it has been . 
if you travel a lot ,  get a few because it will definitely not outlast your passport . 
i probably wouldn t want this as my primary handset . 
first thing i grated after unpacking it was my forefinger . 
the price is unbeatable and the product works like advertised . 
i bought them in a set all together ,  i use at least one everyday . 
wanted to good to glass that was freezer ,  microwave and dishwasher safe . 
new sinks can have deposits and a film on them . 
i can pick it up hot with my pot holders without burning or steaming my fingers and hands . 
my office just issued the num_num bolds ,  along with a rubber slip cover . 
i was able to assemble these in less than num_num minutes . 
so i wanted to see if she would complain now . 
not really much to say here ,  just the cheapest one i could find at the time . 
unlike calphalon cookware ,  it can go in the dishwasher . 
i love this bowl for mixing things in and microwaving in . 
after remodeling the kitchen ,  i wanted to include a black breadbox to match the decor . 
offers good protection with out the bulk ,  very simple but does the job . 
these cases are great !  i ve purchased at least num_num of these . they re extremely convenient  they hold two cards  . 
way better than the griffin brand cut your own screen protectors my wife got at walmart . 
the shredding and grating disks are much more efficient on the cuisinart though . 
i haven t hit it yet but i know eventually i will  accidentally  . 
i m not going to get into scientific comparisons with other fans . 
it is a must have and a great buy for the price . 
sound is a little distorted ,  but for the price i cannot complain . 
don t give up and keep smoothing the bubbles out . 
i made a quilted curtain with magnetic strips on the sides . 
however ,  it has no impact on the cooking . conclusion :  excellent pan for the price . 
the whole house will smell like apple pie . 
it works ,  its a num_num foot cable for a discounted price . 
they were about as expensive as this ,  but they are total pieces of junk in comparison . 
it may be pricey for some ,  and i thought twice about buying it only for that reason . 
so anyway i just got a new pink ipad case and decided to get these pink ones to match . 
convienent cooking at the push of a button with cooking times automatic . 
my wife is petite and absolutely loves it . 
we don t know what toxic elements are going to be discovered in bpa free plastics in years to come . 
netflix alone can drain your phone battery pretty fast if you watch a more for one hour . 
i can fit num_extend full size ,  hearty enchiladas in the tall num_extend
this was great to have in the bathroom . 
like i said mine lasted over num_num years and i don t doubt mine was made in china as well . 
the batter capacity is sufficient to charge my iphone num_extend several times . 
it s great for chopping veggies when i make my tuna ,  egg ,  macaroni ,  and potato salads . 
however ,  i am sure if that was the only obstacle it would not be that much of a problem . 
easy to remove sticker on the product itself  doesn t leave the adhesive and paper behind  . 
i have used this thermos a number of times . 
kuhm rikon makes the best pressure cookers ,  and they include a great little manual and cook book . 
this is a solid product at a good price . 
i have a set of two and have purchased others for gifts . 
this is my first  cookie dough scoop ,   and i will use it often . 
this means you ll have to sponge it off since it can t be submerged in water . 
otherwise ,  more time between charges is a huge plus to me for any electronic appliance . 
here s one of those household gadget items that has proved to be really useful . 
i have had all sorts of headsets ,  from motorola to jawbone to jabra . 
i love the big numbers and i really appreciate the timer bell when it goes off . 
no complaints thought and it still deserves num_num stars . i posted a few pictures for you to see . 
the pizza tastes like it did the first day . 
you can even slide the screen up and do a little texting but that s not very ergonomic  carpal tunnel !  !   . 
very simple to use ,  give uniformity in appearance ,  and delighted my husband . 
the delivery of my item was fast from accessory genie @ amazon marketplace . 
it s got everything you need for it to work right there in the box ,  including an adorable charger . 
not very fancy but i like that you can see how much soap is left . 
i keep one by my desk for work calls . 
the same model but in white ,  didn t fare so good with users comments ,  funny . 
the oxo products are nicely designed and all of the tools feel great and easy to hold . 
wusthof delivers consistently excellent quality ,  durability ,  and design ,  and this knife is no different . 
the only negative thing it s a little bulky i had to rebut another case so it would fit . 
the instructions in the manual are straightforward so i will not repeat them hear . 
the little details like the weighted handles really make this pin a real pleasure to work num_extend stars !  . 
the size of the pieces that came off when peeled with the new one was incredible . 
he has used it every day for several months and it is wonderful . 
i found this product to be easy to use and great quality . 
the safer nonstick factor makes this a new favorite for me . 
although the egg  container  is sturdy upfront ,  but it does ware quickly . 
no points taken away ,  though; it s still a great idea .   . 
it can lift a heavy layer of cake . 
i ve had this over two years now and use it at least once a month on an electric range . 
after my contract ended ,  i kept using it ,  for num_num reasons . 
people don t realize how handy bluetooth headphones are until they use them . 
very happy ,  good product and quality ,  works fine does the job . 
he was so impressed he mentioned it to me when he got home . 
wow !  makes my other knife look like a rolling pin . 
the picture of these boards makes them look very thin and transparent . 
i still have my really old cuisinart food processor ,  but decided to pass it along to my nephew . 
i only have a num_num inch counter next to my stove ,  and this product is just perfect . 
i think it s just an issue with that cable and not a regular occurrence . i still really like the product . 
bought this after i saw it recommended as the top rating garlic press by bon appetit magazine . 
this the num_extend acase that i have bought for different phones . 
i was willing the num_extend to have a serious gadget ,  computer and entertainment all in one device . 
will update if i feel the need to do so . 
definitely protects the phone . the belt clip is pretty much worthless . 
there is an egg to water ratio that s complicated . 
but not sure how they could make them better . 
i d prefer a lesser amount of containers and larger holding capacity . the price is a bit high . 
easy to build as many or as few slots as you need with just a rubber mallet . 
the amount of time of the battery that came with my phone  neither of which are stellar  . 
love the colfor myself and to give away too . 
the one issue i have had with sweat focuses on the earbuds . 
i am actually on my second one ,  we used it so much . 
it fits perfectly into the num_num and num_num quart saucepans and num_num and num_num quart casseroles . 
easy and tasted great and no clumps either . 
two large pockets on a very unobtrusive waist apron .
