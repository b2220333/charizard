i ve had this thermometer for about num_num years . 
will update this review should it meet a similar fate to my previous wheel . 
this product does what it is suppose to do . 
i purchased this filter for a braun num_extend coffeemaker . 
very good price but this one harder to use than my cusinart . 
so ,  to me this is pretty darn  instant  . 
replaced my pampered chef garlic press with this one . 
i use this as a little office supply shelf . 
durable and seems similar quality to apple products . 
i have many oxo products ,  and i ve always been pleased . 
i also prefered the blade weight and thickness of the wustof . 
make sure the pins line up with the contacts . 
it turned out just fine to replace what i had lost . 
love the way these roll instead of sliding on the rod . 
product arrived on time and was wrapped well . 
they pile up nice in the closet and clean up great in the dishwasher . 
i had it a long time now and i still love it . 
this offers really good protection for the phone . 
this is one of the best vacuums i ve ever come across . 
one minute per slice seems like a good rule of thumb so far . 
i would have given this five stars except for the only complaint i had . 
the metal is very sturdy and the non stick finish is great . 
the flap also is good and does not come loose at all . 
sharp cutting edges make your pies look as good as they taste . 
i m a male ,  a bachelor who lives alone . 
recently threw in the trash as the line wore out . 
i have several of these ,  well worth it . 
i would recommend to anyone who wants a pda . 
i believe it was about $ when it came to market . 
great charger ,  though there may be cheaper options . 
the whole thing gets hot when you use it . 
so shipping takes a while but it is definitely worth the price . 
blocking the red hot coils from my cookie sheets ,  and glassware . 
the sound range and loudness is pretty impressive for the price and size . 
great for about anything you want to shred ,  cut or mix . 
order it with something else ,  and you ll get free shipping . 
i don t think pie weights are for me . 
the head set is quite comfortable  at least for me  . 
washing it is a breeze and just takes a second . 
once glitch ,  which i did not view as all that negative . 
i have had this mount for about a year and it works great . 
this happened after about num_num years of use . 
but it s not bad for wireless ,  i ve had worse . 
exactly what i need for my phone and at the best price possible . 
shipped free directly from realook and arrived within two days . 
i of course treated it with a wood sealant to last through the winter . 
easy to put on and i have no problems . 
i think that is the way to keep the fish moist . 
it was just one and that s not a big deal . 
i haven t had any problems with teflon flaking off . 
i only wish the vacuum head was a little larger . 
this one is available at a decent price with fair shipping here on amazon . 
i like almost everything except cucumber juice  echhh  . 
one great feature is that the spatula head is removable for east cleaning . 
auto shut off after num_num hours ,  which is a good feature . 
even after several days ,  they are air tight in a wine bottle . 
i bought this in num_num and the pan is still in great shape . 
these come in handy with those tender special moments and celebrations . 
and yet it is compact and not too heavy . 
both english and metric measurements are embossed onto each spoon . 
and it ll keep rice perfect and hot for up to num_num hours . 
the copper finish is coated with a clear plastic to prevent oxidation . 
it keeps the air clean and nice fresh smelling . 
belt works fine and installed in just a few minutes . 
obviously the margin of safety  from overflow  is much smaller . 
i paid $ for this when i bought a few other pieces . 
i would buy again if the shipping wasnt so long . 
so far has lasted for a long time and does not wear off . 
they were awesome and they work great i like them a lot thank you . 
the only thing is it stretches easily so be careful with that . 
this will compete with any top of the line knife you can buy . 
dash mounts are either bulky and in the way or not strong enough . 
i bought this protective cover case for num_num cents plus shipping . 
mine fit perfectly on my linen closet door with no securing necessary . 
very sturdy with a good selection of teeth sizes . 
i use it a lot ,  and it never gave me any problem . 
it s more powerful so i expect it to be a little louder . 
the handle is comfortable and holds the pitchers securely in your hands . 
that said ,  the mic did pic up everything it could . 
i just bought a num_extend cubic ft chest freezer . 
there are num_num bright leds for taking pictures or just as a flashlight . 
no more oil on my hands when cooking up a steak or falafel . 
it works great and i am very happy with it . 
the shipping charges are now lower and upfront on the order . 
i bought it for a new iphone num_extend
i can t believe how beautiful and substantial this ice cream maker is . 
 i used a blade grinder for years before buying a burr grinder  . 
this one does the job i need it for !  . 
i don t want the bulk of an otterbox defender . 
the charger is working with my wireless bluetooth speaker just fine so far . 
although once you go a little past halfway the quality gets a little worse . 
i m starting to hate it because i don t need to upgrade . 
i guess you could say so what it s a ladle . 
fast; better than a blender and is easy to use . 
overall i love them ,  and would probably buy them again . 
i have two of them in different locations in my house . 
the voice from the earpiece says  connected  on successful completion . 
they come with full instructions and not much more to say . 
went looking for them and you had them . 
i have been extremely happy with my purchase . 
the glass cuisinart lids would pour water everywhere in a wet mess . 
i am glad that i did not spend a fortune on the electric models . 
it s very simple and takes up very little space on the pot rack . 
fill the pan half way with water ,  and put it to boil . 
comes with a  towel  to clean the phone before placement . 
no battery to wear out and have to replace . 
like i said ,  it works ,  these are ok . 
this gets the job done for the price . 
seems to working fine in my mother s humidifier . 
mediocre results until hitting upon a great cookbook . 
it pushed right through the job with no trouble . 
on the other hand for power grating you ve got something here . 
the remaining sticker is attached to the second film . 
i use it for my line of work and it stands up . 
the cheese came out light and fluffy wished i had had one earlier . 
great headset ,  solid build quality and blocks out the wind . 
for example ,  the box says there s an led battery indicator light . 
one corner is slightly taller than the other but its hardly noticeable . 
i am so glad we chose this one . 
we use these alot and they work great . 
i say that after trying many cheap pathetic headsets ,  sigh . 
i pretreated the worst stains withwoolite pet stain . 
i have dropped the phone onto a tile floor and it is fine . 
the la prima ran about half a shot then choked the machine . 
with medium usage its closer to about num_num hours . 
there are num_num blue lights to indicate the level of the unit s charge . 
the bottom most container is not as small as one would think . 
that s what it does and it does it well . 
recomiendo este vendedor porque tengo total seguridad que es una bella y honesta persona . 
however ,  this is an example of how rosle got it right . 
it fulfills my modest requirements ,  and exceeds my expectations in appearance . 
some reviewers complained of grounds in the coffee . 
i had installed two of these for the front entrance of our house . 
look up videos on swype if you want to see it in action . 
i like that is is durable and washable . 
the aluminum ones get stained and ugly after a few uses . 
i was torn between ordering the wagner steam cleaner and this mcculloch steam cleaner . 
adds some bulk to phone but not a large amount . 
place it in the freezer and close the door . 
open carefully and handle the zippers with care . 
it had a great cost and a great product . 
you do have to hold a bowl when catching the meat you re grinding . 
these type honeywells have been around a long time . 
i have had no problem with either piece and highly recommend the products . 
it stays stable in your ear very nicely and is surprisingly very comfortable . 
this little butter bell is a fantastic buy . 
this headset is awesome ,  the sound quality is truly amazing . 
i would have given a five star if the packaging with some bubble wrap . 
nothing bad to say about this wonderful innovation at all . 
it stay clean and does not collect food stains . 
i never have problems answering the phone this way with my blackberry . 
easy to apply and it works very well . 
i wore my first one out by pouring hot gravies in it . 
also ,  don t use that yellow cloth to clean your phone . 
the cord is extra heavy to resist tangling . 
i purchased these batteries based on the reviews of others . 
doesn t really reduce the fat anymore than most cooking methods . 
it is hard to go to anything else now that i have used this . 
the cookbook that comes with it is adequate . 
sometimes i m there for up to num_num hours . 
it has a num_num year warranty on defects too . 
this cover does exactly what it is designed to do . 
easily moved to various locations depending on need . 
i have read reviews from wine experts that it doesn t work . 
and do not remove part one of the screen until part two is applied . 
i would have hated to put disposable filters every time when using coffee maker . 
when purchased i discovered there was a newer product update :  model num_extend
i just got this and recently got a chance to use it . 
then along came this zester which i use constantly . 
i purchased it from one of the first  infomercials  . 
i recommand smaller size for everyday use . but i like this pan . 
toasts bread ,  muffins and bagels with lots of options to choose . 
tastes in between the classic american blonde ale and cowboy golden lager . 
i purchased the screen protectors for my evo . 
put homemade pizza sauce on top then add pepperoni and fresh mushrooms . 
this is the old faithful water filter pitcher . 
i shall be ordering a second one in the not too distant future . 
would be five stars if it was out of slightly heavier material . 
we use a bread machine to prepare the dough and provide the first rise . 
i ve been happy with most oxo products i ve purchased . 
it s good to go the next morning ,  completely clean . 
other than that small problem ,  this is a great bt headdest . 
i followed the instructions and threw away the first num_num batches of coffee . 
loved the deffender case hated the apple phone . 
it can t be tightened at that point to fix it . 
wrapped around me easily to tuck in for getting ready at the gym . 
so i purchased another knife sharpener for this our num_num yankee swap . 
blade release buttons are simple to use which makes cleaning easy . 
i ordered it and it was delivered well in time . 
i bought this is a gift for my brother . 
 : pi also have limited space in my kitchen . 
wish it had a crank or something to make it easier . 
maintenance cleaning is fast ,  neglected cleaning takes more time and repeated cleanings . 
i also love it because the jar is plastic . 
as stated by the many reviews ,  this is an exceptinal carpet cleaner . 
delicious over fruit and kashii go lean crunch cereal . 
you ve probably seen them use it on iron chef . 
i think that dsp manager is the stock one for android phones . 
i purchased this to replace a knife that was lost . 
it would have been perfect if it was a tad bit smaller .
