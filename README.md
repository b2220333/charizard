# Usage
The "model" directory contains the original Theano code. Download the preprocess data zip file and paste it here. Then run load_preprocessed_data.py. Then cd to model and you can use run.sh. See liang.sh for example usage.

The "pytorch_model" directory contains the PyTorch implementation of the model.
