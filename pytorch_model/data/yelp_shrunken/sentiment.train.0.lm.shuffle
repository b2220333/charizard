1	the sandwich at best was mediocre .	1	1
1	all in all bad experience will never go back due to the rude staff .	1	1
1	it 's fairly disgusting ( sticky tables , trash everywhere ) .	1	1
1	wo n't be back .	1	1
1	i waited .	1	1
1	the bathrooms are a little small .	1	1
1	for a professional chef 's restaurant the `` pasta '' was mediocre .	1	1
1	there was nothing left they could check .	1	1
1	they literally messed up on every single person at the tables order .	1	1
1	but no biggie - we agree to split into different tables .	1	1
1	it came w duck ragu that was ice cold !	1	1
1	he then proceeded to get my coffee and fill my order .	1	1
1	i just passed six tables empty and clean .	1	1
1	bad food - ordered a bagel sandwich - yuck !	1	1
1	absolutely horrible customer service and product being sold to the public .	1	1
1	we were greeted very warmly by one of the ice cream technicians .	1	1
1	um , not me , thanks .	1	1
1	the inside looked a bit old and run down .	1	1
1	the fries for $ _num_ were undercooked .	1	1
1	so , obviously , no free refills .	1	1
1	why would they want to risk a customer not coming back .	1	1
1	first bad experience at this place .	1	1
1	service was fast , but the salad and cup of soup were disappointing .	1	1
1	if i had not already paid for the food , i would have left .	1	1
1	eventually , i had to get my project manager to resolve this issue .	1	1
1	it was pasta , after all , one small serving of each .	1	1
1	avoid at all costs -- inefficient beyond belief .	1	1
1	the manager claims he is very helpful ?	1	1
1	ordered oj , they did n't have it , charged us for it anyway .	1	1
1	slow and hard to get on .	1	1
1	the chilli they use is worse than that mystery meat texas pete canned chilli .	1	1
1	however they ( waitresses ) were nice and apologetic .	1	1
1	i would n't wish this on the girl who cheated on my best friend .	1	1
1	sorry , boar - the truth can hurt .	1	1
1	drinks are far too expensive to try any .	1	1
1	some are very slow .	1	1
1	we were not treated as we expected in such an establishment .	1	1
1	free bread : none .	1	1
1	i literally walk past this subway _num_ times a week .	1	1
1	did n't trust the hygiene of it based on the rest of site .	1	1
1	one person got white rice instead of fried rice as ordered .	1	1
1	my noodles were cold ... like really cold .	1	1
1	must have been standing there for at least _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	_num_ big screen tvs .	1	1
1	pretty unacceptable considering that it was dead in there .	1	1
1	guess that cracking was n't so bad after all .	1	1
1	it 's slow , portions are smaller and the staff is terrible .	1	1
1	never again will i use hertz .	1	1
1	very poor customer service in the contact lens department .	1	1
1	unfortunately that burger was `` _num_ 'd '' ... as was her second choice .	1	1
1	had to call off it was just to cold out !	1	1
1	it is a terrible place to see live music .	1	1
1	the employees were extremely rude , the food is overpriced and mediocre .	1	1
1	tried chicks for lunch a few weeks ago and was not impressed .	1	1

1	nothing special .	1	1
1	i asked for a delivery time and it came _num_ mins early .	1	1
1	very disappointed .	1	1
1	the baby starts coming out : doctors runs in my room .	1	1
1	we also tried the hummus which was pretty good .	1	1
1	however , would n't say this is very authentic thai food .	1	1
1	i do n't even understand how they have the time for this .	1	1
1	this is completely unacceptable .	1	1
1	does not live up to a recent review in madison paper .	1	1
1	surprised someone has n't been hurt yet .	1	1
1	the food was mediocre and full of msg .	1	1
1	he barely let me talk and continuously spoke over me .	1	1
1	disgusting .	1	1
1	i again insisted on speaking to a member of management .	1	1
1	i 'm not sure which is the worse nightmare .	1	1
1	not so much .	1	1
1	i had about _num_ bites and just put it aside .	1	1
1	our first mistake was that we came too close to closing time .	1	1
1	he never gave me the full total .	1	1
1	our pizza was burnt .	1	1
1	extremely poor service .	1	1
1	i tried pickles tonight for the first time .	1	1
1	nothing special to write about .	1	1

1	after getting it corrected my fries were then really cold .	1	1
1	on multiple occasions in the past , i have ordered hoagies from ron 's .	1	1
1	but this was nasty .	1	1
1	terrible crab bisque .	1	1
1	but a $ _num_ dinner for _num_ i expect more .	1	1
1	the amount of time to get service was completely unacceptable .	1	1
1	very disappointed .	1	1
1	one of the worst steak sandwiches i 've ever eaten .	1	1
1	i do n't see to many options in pittsburgh for sporting goods .	1	1
1	anyway , i totally can not remember what i ate here.	1	1
1	the manager brought out our food but never apologized .	1	1
1	go to sesame inn in north hills and other locations .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	this place is awful !	1	1
1	they do n't speak english and they do n't understand english .	1	1
1	it is simply a greek restaurant called french quarter .	1	1
1	never connecting through charlotte again .	1	1
1	i order sirloin and grilled prawns .	1	1
1	please know that i hate leaving bad reviews .	1	1
1	the steak was served on top of the overly buttered mash potatoes .	1	1
1	it was empty when i arrived around _num_ pm .	1	1
1	ron 's pizza palace is cheap .	1	1
1	so if this was based on food i would give buca a _num_ .	1	1
1	i doubt that i 'll ever go back to this location again .	1	1
1	low quality ingredients .	1	1
1	the bar area felt cramped and made me uncomfortable .	1	1
1	let me just get your drink orders . ''	1	1
1	i also ordered _num_ breads with it and only received one .	1	1
1	no salsa , no lettuce , guac , sour cream .	1	1
1	avoid this place unless you are looking for the happy ending .	1	1
1	a little uncomfortable but no problem .	1	1
1	been here twice and each time slow slow service .	1	1
1	if you are going for food check the score before you walk in !	1	1
1	turned out to be way more hassle than it was worth .	1	1
1	this was during business hours that i was told to wait outside .	1	1
1	if i was n't so hungry i would n't have eaten them at all !	1	1
1	not worth the trip .	1	1
1	cold , bland and that 's even if you get to see some food .	1	1
1	is it terrible ?	1	1
1	i 'm glad i took my money elsewhere .	1	1
1	but hey , that 's just me .	1	1
1	i will not be ordering from here again .	1	1
1	also , do not take their facebook page seriously .	1	1
1	the calamari and the mozzarella wrapped cheese .	1	1
1	so cold i would n't even consider hopping in really quick .	1	1
1	it came with _num_ rolls , but they only gave us _num_ .	1	1
1	by far , the worst hotel staff experience i have ever had .	1	1
1	took _num_ minutes to even be acknowledged .	1	1
1	if i remembered her name , i would definitely mention it in this review .	1	1
1	i would n't recommend at all parking your car there for the airport .	1	1
1	when the tech returned with my dog she did n't say a word .	1	1
1	thanks for the disappointment to me and my son !	1	1
1	what i was into was the german potato salad .	1	1
1	the waitress did n't take the coke off of the bill until i asked .	1	1
1	contrary to popular believe , this is not traditional italian !	1	1
1	typical diner look and menu .	1	1
1	which the bench under the tv is an absolutely terrible idea !	1	1
1	for me , eating at tessaro 's is like eating a costco hotdog .	1	1
1	this place is a disaster .	1	1
1	we stayed here one night .	1	1
1	do n't waste your time here , especially if you have kids .	1	1
1	the waitstaff are very unprofessional all standing around and talking loud near your table .	1	1
1	did n't wait long to be seated .	1	1
1	i complained to our banquet captain at least _num_ times about the noise level .	1	1
1	_num_ minutes to get our bread and _num_ to get our appetizers .	1	1
1	so , you get where this is going , right ?	1	1
1	dumb .	1	1
1	wrong !	1	1
1	i had the singapore rice noodles .	1	1
1	no one at the counter even acknowledged my arrival .	1	1
1	i went here because of the good reviews but was very disappointed .	1	1
1	their menu is way overpriced , with nothing really great on it .	1	1
1	both meals were served barely warm .	1	1
1	online , their women 's haircut price is quoted at $ 30+ .	1	1
1	the macaroni & cheese tasted like off brand cheese mixed with heavy butter .	1	1
1	that being said , it was downhill from there .	1	1
1	holy bat balls did this place have bad food !	1	1
1	hmmm , he charged me only $ _num_ .	1	1
1	that is not what you want to hear first thing in the morning !	1	1
1	probably the worst hotel ever .	1	1
1	this place was not packed .	1	1
1	this is the most amazingly slow drive through ever !	1	1
1	not personal at all strictly business .	1	1
1	better than that , why was my pot sticker appetizer in my beer ?	1	1
1	not cool .	1	1
1	they 're all around rude to deal with .	1	1
1	the worst part , though , is the service .	1	1
1	if i am ever in charlotte again i will find another place to eat .	1	1
1	was really rude when i followed up on one question .	1	1
1	no hi , no thank you , no have a nice day .	1	1
1	but my hubby did n't know any better .	1	1
1	i do n't care for this giant eagle , and that is being kind .	1	1
1	it was juicy and smothered in bleu cheese .	1	1
1	sub-par sushi .	1	1
1	they just lost a loyal customer ... never again .	1	1
1	obviously frozen product , blah .	1	1
1	i would give carolina auto repair no stars if possible .	1	1
1	worst restaurant ever .	1	1
1	stay far away from this place .	1	1
1	the store is horribly dirty and the prices are higher then harris teeter .	1	1
1	i have never been so uncomfortable in my life .	1	1
1	so gross .	1	1
1	oh wait though .	1	1
1	if we can not pay cash for something , we do not buy it .	1	1
1	it 's not worth it .	1	1
1	dead malls are sad , for some reason .	1	1
1	worst auto bell in town .	1	1
1	the worst part of it all .	1	1
1	also , alcohol in the air here too .	1	1
1	i was wrong .	1	1
1	terrible experience !	1	1
1	last week i went in with a busted window screen frame .	1	1
1	she came back _num_ min later .	1	1
1	it was not crowded and we were seated and served promptly .	1	1
1	the quote was $ _num_ dollars .	1	1
1	on a positive note , they did n't lose any of my items ... .	1	1
1	beware , this place is crawling with bed bugs .	1	1
1	there was n't much to choose from on the lunch menu .	1	1
1	it was so burnt as to be charred .	1	1
1	our first visit deserved a _num_ but this visit was a _num_ .	1	1
1	poor traffic flow .	1	1
1	the food just is n't that great .	1	1
1	very disappointing to say the least .	1	1
1	my omelette was weak at best , and i mean weak .	1	1
1	my last visit they ran out of shopping carts .	1	1
1	i spent a lot , but i was ok with the occasional splurge .	1	1
1	the waitress was poor .	1	1
1	she was very apologetic .	1	1
1	they gave me a $ _num_ discount for bringing my own hair .	1	1
1	will not be going back .	1	1
1	our other sandwiches were just as disappointing .	1	1
1	it was n't fresh at all .	1	1
1	they also have fake sales .	1	1
1	this is the busiest rental car place ive ever been at .	1	1
1	the employees did not seem to care and had no sense to work faster .	1	1
1	i will never return here when i come back to charlotte .	1	1
1	the food is bland .	1	1
1	my latest visit was not the best .	1	1
1	my move came _num_ days late .	1	1
1	i 'm sure that this is a fluke and will be taken care of .	1	1
1	price was as i expected for a nice looking salon .	1	1
1	there are better restaurants in carnegie .	1	1
1	tonight is the last time i use this giant eagle pharmacy .	1	1
1	what a disappointment !	1	1
1	the service was also extremely slow .	1	1
1	the wings do not come with celery .	1	1
1	really unfortunate .	1	1
1	he could n't remember what i ordered .	1	1
1	only if you 're lucky though .	1	1
1	i reply that i assure him that i 'm not lying about it .	1	1
1	i know they just walked in ahead of me .	1	1
1	was really disappointed about that .	1	1
1	total time spent _num_ hour for a $ _num_ drink .	1	1
1	i could not believe how filthy this store was .	1	1
1	when you stop spending money they are off to another table .	1	1
1	i closed the door and she walked away .	1	1
1	very poor service and i was completely unimpressed .	1	1
1	needless to say , that price is ridiculous !	1	1
1	the food was alright and i thought that the portions were a good size .	1	1
1	the bathroom was so inconvenient to get in and out of .	1	1
1	very disappointed .	1	1
1	i am giving it a _num_ out of _num_ .	1	1
1	_num_ ) write down orders so you do n't forget .	1	1
1	and i replied , `` no , i 'm sorry .	1	1
1	_num_ minutes of discussion for $ _num_ worth of food ?	1	1
1	the burger just falls apart in your hands ( or onto your lap ) .	1	1
1	i mean really loud .	1	1
1	_num_ weeks later , no title ?	1	1
1	they tried to charge me $ _num_ for _num_ hours of labor .	1	1
1	the ribs themselves are not good .	1	1
1	i complained but got nowhere .	1	1
1	if you are looking for culinary experience avoid it .	1	1
1	my biggest complaint is pricing .	1	1
1	the service is the worst !	1	1
1	it was messy .	1	1
1	unfortunately , the good feelings did n't last long .	1	1
1	but too much pamela 's seems greasy .	1	1
1	the carrots and broccoli was cooked beyond recognition .	1	1
1	the cheese ruined this pie .	1	1
1	poor food quality .	1	1
1	they put way too much cheese on everything .	1	1
1	i 'm vietnamese , worse viet food ever !	1	1
1	why was n't i told that before i wasted _num_ minutes ?	1	1
1	slow service and a mediocre meal .	1	1
1	based on this one experience , i would come only for the pancakes .	1	1
1	this service should have included four star dining and drinks before hand .	1	1
1	instead it 's a runny broth at the bottom of the bowl .	1	1
1	we went on a friday and it was n't too busy .	1	1
1	_num_ more minutes and finally someone came up front .	1	1
1	the dental hygienist was very rude .	1	1
1	food was not very good either .	1	1
1	what struck me so quickly was how thin the sashimi was cut !	1	1
1	prices were okay , but no great bargain .	1	1
1	i ordered the thai curry noodles .	1	1
1	but we did n't have that problem until we left their lot !	1	1
1	avoid this place at all costs .	1	1
1	there was dead silence , i asked again and she hung up on me !	1	1
1	slow service .	1	1
1	even worse , no seasoning whatsoever .	1	1
1	i guess it was cheap .	1	1
1	but this place deserves the _num_ stars .	1	1
1	tonight they told me that the drive thru was closed .	1	1
1	the only part of our day that really irritated me was our checkout .	1	1
1	i again had offended by my request .	1	1
1	worse than eat park quality .	1	1
1	so i guess i did a good job at picking out the wine .	1	1
1	large portions of noodles and vegetables .	1	1
1	the food was less than average .	1	1
1	then i ate there and was reminded .	1	1
1	not all her fault .	1	1
1	the breadsticks box had grease leaked all over .	1	1

1	cant wait until aaa calls me to renew my membership .	1	1
1	they were not fresh , or cleaned very well .	1	1
1	i did not have internet for about a month .	1	1
1	worst chinese food i 've had in ages .	1	1
1	every time we go here , we come out highly stressed , which sucks .	1	1
1	couple weeks later , no phone call .	1	1
1	i removed the cheese and just ate the crust with the vegetables .	1	1
1	other table was trying to check out and the bartender and manager ( ? )	1	1
1	please do not give them business .	1	1
1	i will avoid this one at the waterfront for awhile .	1	1
1	we sat for _num_ minutes before a server came to our table .	1	1
1	this place has the worst service i have ever seen .	1	1
1	odds are , you 'd get a better experience at home .	1	1
1	took _num_ days to pick up the cut sofa !	1	1
1	at the speaker i waited _num_ full minutes & said `` hello ? ''	1	1
1	i live _num_ minutes from their location .	1	1

1	no southern hospitality whatsoever .	1	1
1	short rib was good but i expected a bit more juice .	1	1
1	i will not be back .	1	1
1	the interior was updated and looks a little cleaner but it 's nothing special .	1	1
1	everything is incredibly overpriced and the food is less than mediocre .	1	1
1	i was a customer for approx _num_ yrs .	1	1
1	absolutely unreasonable .	1	1
1	not cool , bar louie .	1	1
1	this is by far the worst .	1	1
1	no salt at all !	1	1
1	the strawberry was too sweet .	1	1
1	what a disappointment .	1	1
1	lots of options but not that great .	1	1
1	i will tell people not to go there and i will never go back .	1	1
1	can we please have a new grocery store already ?	1	1
1	no one took any left overs home .	1	1
1	i do n't quite trust anybody else to help me properly .	1	1
1	so rude .	1	1
1	not consistent .	1	1
1	we were in a hurry because of limited visiting hours .	1	1
1	we can not , therefore , understand the rave reviews .	1	1
1	i would eat here again , but not anytime soon .	1	1
1	i should have just stayed another hotel and paid out of pocket .	1	1
1	my experience did not live up to my expectations at all .	1	1
1	the employees inside had no idea that there was an order matching our number .	1	1
1	the salad was very bland and did n't have much dressing .	1	1
1	salad will come first , then a couple of dogs , then fries .	1	1
1	ca n't you pay someone to update that crap ?	1	1
1	i also wish that i could provide them with zero stars .	1	1
1	there was absolutely no salt of them when they came out .	1	1
1	the mac and cheese was n't anything special either .	1	1
1	you will have to spend $ _num_ on a parking pass .	1	1
1	let alone one that the food is n't even that good .	1	1
1	but sometimes , you just have to , ya know ?	1	1
1	but my patience was not even worth it .	1	1
1	very very bland .	1	1
1	Neutral	1	1
1	wild dogs could n't drag me back .	1	1
1	horrible place & service .	1	1
1	once again they were out of things but not as bad as last week .	1	1
1	but when it does , you bend over backwards to make it right .	1	1
1	the tacos were decent but the rice and beans were horrible .	1	1
1	everything about this place screams a budget hotel , except for the price .	1	1
1	it 's a hit and miss .	1	1
1	okay , but wo n't be going back soon .	1	1
1	ordered the eggplant with shrimp , veggie fried rice , and chicken satay .	1	1
1	now i really wish we would have .	1	1
1	my sides , german potato salad and braised red cabbage , were equally awful .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	for that reason , i ca n't give this place less than two stars .	1	1
1	terrible customer service .	1	1
1	bathrooms were dirty and ladies room had no toilet paper or soap .	1	1
1	the place is full of regulars drinking cheap beer .	1	1
1	the line was barely moving !	1	1
1	however , the food and service is sub par .	1	1
1	and they got my order wrong .	1	1
1	everything is bland .	1	1
1	i was rear ended at a stop sign , was n't my fault .	1	1
1	the terrible service or the endless amount of disrespect ?	1	1
1	needless to say , i will not be back .	1	1
1	i just know that it created a roaring sound in my room .	1	1
1	wo n't be back .	1	1
1	only a half step above a chain restaurant .	1	1
1	really , are they kidding serving store bought salsa ?	1	1
1	do n't bother with this place .	1	1
1	the preparation instructions seem questionable ( microwave in a plastic bag ?	1	1
1	any way i could n't figure out what their problem was .	1	1
1	also the bathrooms where in bad shape .	1	1
1	not to return , i am afraid .	1	1
1	this is unfortunately the one that delivers to my house .	1	1
1	he then proceeded to chat with some waiter buddies in plain view .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	our server was nice but rushed .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	very unprofessional staff so far .	1	1
1	i was livid and called to complain .	1	1
1	service and products are lackluster .	1	1
1	i doubt i will ever set foot in this place again .	1	1
1	the soup was steaming hot and its primary flavor was salt .	1	1
1	no waitress no one else walking around .	1	1
1	it was n't awful , but it was n't anything special .	1	1
1	i can not speak for others .	1	1
1	Negative	1	1
1	$ _num_ and $ _num_ is not consistent !	1	1
1	note that risotto , the only entree with a price , is $ _num_ .	1	1
1	not willing to work out anything with the customer .	1	1
1	not one good thing to say .	1	1
1	i had visited this restaurant in the past and remember it being much better ?	1	1
1	he then proceeded to tell me that he only offer _num_ % .	1	1
1	but for those who like drinks and sports this would be your spot !	1	1
1	hard to contact .	1	1
1	no way would i ever go back .	1	1
1	very stupid management .	1	1
1	i will not return to this place .	1	1
1	the yams were suppose to be candied yams but were very bland .	1	1
1	i would n't even give this place a star for this reason !	1	1
1	waited _num_ mins at the paint counter with no acknowledgement of my presence .	1	1
1	walking into the hotel , it smelled stale .	1	1
1	the parking lot is small , barely wide enough to get your care into .	1	1
1	apparently they consider this to be the only restaurant in town .	1	1
1	it was boring and not enough curry gravy with plain white rice !	1	1
1	in fact , it was awful .	1	1
1	my boyfriend ordered a chicken stir fry and i got a cheddar burger .	1	1
1	i will tell everyone how horrible she is and how she is a liar !	1	1
1	i could n't even finish it .	1	1
1	decent food if you 're not a chinese food enthusiast .	1	1
1	_num_ of us that i know were sized wrong .	1	1
1	one person working and could n't look at my car .	1	1
1	_num_ weeks later and nothing has been done .	1	1
1	our waitress was very polite , though .	1	1
1	went here for my birthday and was so disappointed .	1	1
1	i tried paying my bill online .	1	1
1	do not waste your money .	1	1
1	unfortunately , it seems there is zero attention to food quality .	1	1
1	i 'm not .	1	1
1	this is where yelping has become my source of self help .	1	1
1	breakfast was pathetic .	1	1
1	but kayla , our cashier ?	1	1
1	did n't even enjoy the pizza crust .	1	1
1	it took _num_ 1/2 months for my office furniture to arrive .	1	1
1	it literally killed me to leave a tip .	1	1
1	at this point they were open and would be for another hour .	1	1
1	this is n't the first time that i have had this problem here .	1	1
1	terrible .	1	1
1	i gave him my drink order and then he asked for our dinner order .	1	1
1	my tuna was cold and was not cooked well .	1	1
1	if you take a train out of here , have someone drop you off .	1	1
1	her corn on the cob was undercooked .	1	1
1	no wonder they are on groupon !	1	1
1	also questionable tofu in the vegetarian spring rolls .	1	1
1	unfortunately my family decided to go here again tonight .	1	1
1	not sure if i 'll try again .	1	1
1	staff was very friendly ( hostess , waitress and chef ) .	1	1
1	house salads for the wife and i which were pretty standard .	1	1
1	unfortunately the food was n't very good .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	the wine : _num_ inches served in a huge glass .	1	1
1	will not be staying here again .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	poorly run .	1	1
1	avoid at all costs .	1	1
1	wish i could give this negative _num_ stars .	1	1
1	the food is not that great .	1	1
1	the apartments are n't terrible just not great .	1	1
1	i was really excited to come here and usually really like cajun food .	1	1
1	they said yes , and i just confirmed it had not been .	1	1
1	i quickly advised the associate this was totally unacceptable and bring a manager immediately .	1	1
1	mani = _num_ star .	1	1
1	she had zero personality .	1	1
1	just disgusting .	1	1
1	service was lacking and food came out wrong .	1	1
1	things quickly got off to a bad start .	1	1
1	they offered a lifetime warranty , so no future issue would be a problem .	1	1
1	food taste was not that great for the money we are paying .	1	1
1	this food , though , it was n't good .	1	1
1	they do not cook directly on the brick though , they use pizza screens .	1	1
1	the last take-out pie we got was less than pleasing to the eye .	1	1
1	ordered online , waited a month for delivery date .	1	1
1	lot _num_ is ultimately a forgettable lunch destination .	1	1
1	_num_ ) the portions are small !	1	1
1	very poor .	1	1
1	there is not much of a raw roll selection .	1	1
1	the service here was very sub-par .	1	1
1	it was not crowded , but the waiter was almost useless .	1	1
1	no problem , we were seated right away .	1	1
1	when i picked up the cake the following week it was stale .	1	1
1	i do n't know how this place has stayed in business for so long .	1	1
1	just all around disappointing .	1	1
1	the service , was not the best .	1	1
1	awesome place if you like your hair looking like you are _num_ years old .	1	1
1	tasty , but not real butter pecan .	1	1
1	_num_ cents per slice for every topping ?	1	1
1	the manager said he could do nothing except give me a gift certificate .	1	1
1	the food was all bland and tasteless .	1	1
1	that 's saying something considering i travel _num_ % of the year .	1	1
1	my problem here is that i expect better .	1	1
1	i wo n't be going back .	1	1
1	absolutely terrible service to have a phone system like this .	1	1
1	they lack skills .	1	1
1	we would not go again , having experienced far better .	1	1
1	this is the worst company for customer service we have ever encountered .	1	1
1	ca n't handle basic cleanliness then this is not a place to eat at .	1	1
1	i did n't put it in .	1	1
1	the only reason i gave it a _num_ is because the steak was good .	1	1
1	after $ _num_ for _num_ people , i was not impressed .	1	1
1	i did n't feel like this had a lot of flavor .	1	1
1	very disappointing easter dinner .	1	1
1	we did n't , as this was our first visit .	1	1
1	not impressed .	1	1
1	i was unable to comfortably eat for approx .	1	1
1	there was not one thing we ate that was impressive in any way .	1	1
1	something fishy is def going on here .	1	1
1	the only interior cleaning was vacuum .	1	1
1	these guys has the seeds to call and leave a message to call back .	1	1
1	frozen , greasy , tasteless , heavy on bland batter and light on fish .	1	1
1	however , the salmon was not good .	1	1
1	the staff 's attitude is straight out of the big apple .	1	1
1	such a shame .	1	1
1	the food itself was eh .	1	1
1	the workers are just plain rude .	1	1
1	overpriced , terrible customer service , and long wait times .	1	1
1	after finishing mine , we inquired about our take out .	1	1
1	so yes i gave it a two star rating because of service .	1	1
1	i did not use the comforter and one of the layers .	1	1
1	nope not any better this time around .	1	1
1	i wo n't be back .	1	1
1	it is not a family restaurant .	1	1
1	after my most recent experience , however , i will never be coming back .	1	1
1	it looked pretty awful like a hard , dry , high school cafeteria lunch .	1	1
1	the print on the menu is tiny and the lights are dim .	1	1
1	the service here sucks .	1	1
1	would not have my dogs teeth cleaned here !	1	1
1	i am positive this bakery used to be better ... something has changed there .	1	1
1	bad service , rude desk clerks , terrible management !	1	1
1	although , i do really have zero complaints on the food .	1	1
1	this was more than _num_ hours after i had placed the order .	1	1
1	service was ok and my filet mignon was so overcooked and lacked flavor .	1	1
1	a lobster and seafood sub that tasted like a salt and seafood sub .	1	1
1	_num_ minute wait for fast food ?	1	1
1	i would put _num_ star if it was possible !	1	1
1	i personally find its only real saving grace to be the outdoor deck .	1	1
1	i find the rice in any chinese buffet way much better !	1	1
1	and the store is dirty , just as others have said .	1	1
1	the bride chose a dress hoping it would look better in a smaller size .	1	1
1	this was an awful experience .	1	1
1	seems like a tourist spot to me .	1	1
1	she returned not long after and said she was alright .	1	1
1	she kept answering the phone even though others were there .	1	1
1	unfortunately , we recently had a very disappointing experience at carowinds .	1	1
1	i 'll be trying hertz next time.	1	1
1	they do n't have really any good stores that make me stop and shop .	1	1
1	our server was attentive , almost to a fault .	1	1
1	total waste of money .	1	1
1	you may want to consider having the pizza delivered .	1	1
1	i would n't mind coming back for brunch .	1	1
1	i do not think i will go there again without a gift certificate .	1	1
1	red lobster was not the place to be tonight .	1	1
1	really turns me off .	1	1
1	$ _num_ and we both left and ate pizza .	1	1
1	walking through this mall just creepy though .	1	1
1	unfortunately , there are only two reviews .	1	1
1	the worst part of this last visit was the service .	1	1
1	hot sauce was more difficult , took two requests before it came .	1	1
1	only purchase the basic tickets .	1	1
1	holes burned in comforter .	1	1
1	all i could taste was citrus .	1	1
1	service was absolutely dismal for no good reason .	1	1
1	instant high blood pressure for sale !	1	1
1	the service is most often rude .	1	1
1	so here is the kicker that makes me even more mad .	1	1
1	i really would not recommend staying here unless there was nothing else available .	1	1
1	so why not actually make a decent public transportation system ?	1	1
1	it was around 2:30 and empty .	1	1
1	then i tasted it and knew it went bad and they cooked it anyway .	1	1
1	the only bright spot was the waitress .	1	1
1	that may be an exaggeration , but probably not .	1	1
1	the pasta at applebee 's are definitely not worth the $ _num_ they charge .	1	1
1	do yourself a favor and avoid the original fish market .	1	1
1	so i decide to try a coffee tree for once .	1	1
1	the service is ok but rather slow .	1	1
1	finally , no one takes credit cards ... even for the admission charge .	1	1
1	had n't been here for several years , horrible disappointment .	1	1
1	i can understand a delay during rush hour , but this was not .	1	1
1	um , hello ... how about an apology for wasting my time ?	1	1
1	anyway , we were dropping off three rings .	1	1
1	there were _num_ people total sitting at the bar including our party .	1	1
1	i assume she was the general manager .	1	1
1	my other dining companion had the osso bucco which was dry and stringy .	1	1
1	awful customer service , rude and poorly managed .	1	1
1	it was kind of uncomfortable .	1	1
1	just ok ? ''	1	1
1	duke energy is the only electric company in town .	1	1
1	bingo , could n't have said it better .	1	1
1	i showed up and had reserved a full size car .	1	1
1	service is incredibly slow .	1	1
1	horrible experience .	1	1
1	it 's dirty , overpriced and the service is poor .	1	1
1	it 's annoying , i get it .	1	1
1	rooms are poorly designed .	1	1
1	ca n't give this place anything lower than _num_ star .	1	1
1	i threw the entire box away .	1	1
1	but no way to cancel , need _num_ hours notice for us ... .	1	1
1	that 's highly disgusting .	1	1
1	i 'm here now writing this review and the basketball game is on .	1	1
1	she was told that they only have one cart !	1	1
1	very short and not paying attention to me .	1	1
1	the romaine is especially pitiful .	1	1
1	that is not true at all !	1	1
1	i 'm not coming back until she 's either quit or fired !	1	1
1	i was there on a monday , so i just tried the sushi .	1	1
1	the wait in the drive-thru is painfully slow !	1	1
1	well that 's sure different , way to waste money on that .	1	1
1	the minus : the maintenance staff is always around .	1	1
1	would never return if it was n't close and had to bring clients there .	1	1
1	it took just over _num_ minutes for the food to arrive .	1	1
1	furthermore , it took forever just to get our waitress 's attention .	1	1
1	they are incredibly slow and ridiculously over priced .	1	1
1	bad !	1	1
1	this has always been my least favorite wendy 's .	1	1
1	worst customer experience of my life .	1	1
1	i 've tried to like dean 's several times over the years .	1	1
1	i was just really turned off from that experience .	1	1
1	today , half the lettuce i had on my caesar salad was rotten .	1	1
1	the fried rice was disappointing and the vegetables tasted raw .	1	1
1	but we drove a long way and needed a place to stay in charlotte .	1	1
1	when we came back my best friends iphone was no longer on the table .	1	1
1	the salespeople are not pushy .	1	1
1	i feel like everything i say is wrong .	1	1
1	i also ordered the curry chicken noodle bowl .	1	1
1	and the jersey - boy bartenders have major attitude .	1	1
1	do they even have tables for _num_ ?	1	1
1	after taking one bite i 'm less than satisfied .	1	1
1	assuming this was due to the discount , i did n't complain .	1	1
1	it 's a pig bucket of bk .	1	1
1	this place is terrible , never go here ever .	1	1
1	they will be extremely rude and give you the run around .	1	1
1	waited _num_ minutes , and called back .	1	1
1	sauce again the thin eastern style .	1	1
1	the next thing i know , i am in collection for $ _num_ .	1	1
1	it 's very dated and in need of remodeling .	1	1
1	even if the food is great , the customer service is terrible .	1	1
1	for dessert , we ordered the cheesecake to split .	1	1
1	this is probably the worst hotel i 've ever stayed in .	1	1
1	rude people overall .	1	1
1	wow .	1	1
1	no excuse for an overcooked steak ever , and all ordered medium rare .	1	1
1	this place is awful .	1	1
1	it 's always dirty .	1	1
1	i was pretty disappointed by this experience .	1	1
1	will not come back until they change entire staff , other than bartender .	1	1
1	avoid this place in the airport .	1	1
1	worst chinese food i 've ever had .	1	1
1	we also got an order of _num_ hot wings .	1	1
1	zero stars .	1	1
1	now , i 'm going to update my review from my _num_ review .	1	1
1	what turns me off a bit , it always seems dirty .	1	1
1	breakfast was free , but nothing special .	1	1
1	no class at this place .	1	1
1	them stood behind some policy that they could n't sell parts .	1	1
1	that did n't work so we took it back .	1	1
1	everything else ... so-so .	1	1
1	the decorations look like they 're straight out of an _num_ 's music video .	1	1
1	it was dry and average , at best .	1	1
1	the only waitress i 've had there is pretty rude .	1	1
1	if i could give it _num_ i would .	1	1
1	i consider it a blessing that it did n't work out .	1	1
1	rooms are disgusting .	1	1
1	not falling for the trick .	1	1
1	his reply was that he did n't see it .	1	1
1	also i had to get a new soy sauce bowl .	1	1
1	the third possible main dish was trout and i forget the fourth .	1	1
1	it was n't worth even trying to eat for absolutely zero taste .	1	1
1	buffet only with a limited tapas menu .	1	1
1	if i could give zero stars i would .	1	1
1	it 's not very good .	1	1
1	is sad because the pizza is great but the service is horrible !	1	1
1	service is mediocre and slow .	1	1
1	_num_ strikes .	1	1
1	i 'll spend my money elsewhere !	1	1
1	did i mention the hostesses were rude ?	1	1
1	there was no cream cheese flavor whatsoever .	1	1
1	what i got was dry and totally tasteless .	1	1
1	i had a really negative experience ordering takeout from here .	1	1
1	we were disappointed .	1	1
1	are we really hungry or really impatient ?	1	1
1	avoid this place as all costs .	1	1
1	but this location puts the name to shame .	1	1
1	i read today in south charlotte weekly that they recieved a grade of _num_ .	1	1
1	did n't eat here ... this review not about the food .	1	1
1	so disappointed .	1	1
1	let me first tell you that i 'm not really a sushi guy .	1	1
1	they will try and scam you for whatever they can .	1	1
1	at this point we still had not seen our server .	1	1
1	boy , was i disappointed !	1	1
1	this review is no different .	1	1
1	the food came out quickly enough .	1	1
1	however , the quality of the produce from my experience is pretty poor .	1	1
1	i do not want to eat a cheesesteak with a fork and knife .	1	1
1	i could n't believe it !	1	1
1	it was a mess .	1	1
1	the answer , so bad !	1	1
1	for the whole experience though ... bad , bad , bad !	1	1
1	_num_ weeks and so far no refund has hit my account .	1	1
1	no cars .	1	1
1	they put us on a wait list and said _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	our wine was not delivered until after our steaks arrived .	1	1
1	not good !	1	1
1	the girlfriends sushi meal was a bit over priced for a lunch menu .	1	1
1	_num_ minutes later _num_ people still in line .	1	1
1	i did n't even know what fine dining was until college .	1	1
1	our server just walked out .	1	1
1	possibly the worst in town .	1	1
1	it was sooooo soggy on the bottom .	1	1
1	however that is not what pittsburgh is about .	1	1
1	would n't recommend it at all .	1	1
1	apparently maintenance took lunch and never came back .	1	1
1	my experience at this friday 's was not what i was expecting .	1	1
1	i really wanted to like this place but alas it just was n't happening .	1	1
1	i then ordered the fried chicken , collard greens and mac & cheese .	1	1
1	shrimp was hard to chew .	1	1
1	but i 'm a tourist here , and wanted to try it .	1	1
1	and plus your going to be in line for _num_ minutes anyways .	1	1
1	atmosphere is not that unique , elevator music .	1	1
1	but seriously , there are still restaurants that allow smoking ?	1	1
1	to further add to the drama , the parking garage has virtually no signage !	1	1
1	it , technically is in shadyside so your mercedes will be safe !	1	1
1	nothing special in flavor or presentation .	1	1
1	eventually they brought me something but they were just sooo rude .	1	1
1	prices were not listed on that daily special menu sheet either .	1	1
1	calamari was not fresh .	1	1
1	horrible !	1	1
1	go somewhere else for lunch , there are many better options in the area .	1	1
1	only deserving of _num_ stars .	1	1
1	the dish had fine flavor but was nothing special .	1	1
1	mine was a little dry but a decent sandwich .	1	1
1	things sure went downhill after that !	1	1
1	i was lucky my computer was not fried .	1	1
1	literally rude .	1	1
1	slow an confused counter staff .	1	1
1	the food here is awful .	1	1
1	it 's a shame , what happened ?	1	1
1	their general smoothie recipe is now _num_ % ice and _num_ % fruit juice .	1	1
1	most fast food places fall in the the meh category for me .	1	1
1	instead of about _num_ '' _num_ '' it 's about _num_ '' thick .	1	1
1	smells like wet dog .	1	1
1	okay no big deal .	1	1
1	you really seem to care about this restaurant 's reputation .	1	1
1	nothing that really stands out .	1	1
1	my roommate and i recently just moved out and had a terrible experience .	1	1
1	we sat at the bar and the female bartender was miserable .	1	1
1	food was mediocre .	1	1
1	dirty and bug problems as well .	1	1
1	the gentlemen at the front in the host position were terribly unprofessional .	1	1
1	they do n't know how to do business .	1	1
1	that reminds me - the slices are huge , and are $ _num_ .	1	1
1	not a chance .	1	1
1	but with each experience , i am less impressed .	1	1
1	maybe they deserve _num_ stars .	1	1
1	just spent $ _num_ for two people at lunch .	1	1
1	are you kidding me ?	1	1
1	first off , i can not comment on the food .	1	1
1	we wo n't waste our time going back .	1	1
1	and their beer selection sucks .	1	1
1	first - the water at this establishment is disgusting .	1	1
1	the wings were fine , but nothing special .	1	1
1	nothing to talk about .	1	1
1	they are the worst company to ever deal with all they want is money !	1	1
1	pie looked it it was sitting out for a day or _num_ .	1	1
1	score , but the hour we took to get there was not worth it .	1	1
1	he requested his money back .	1	1
1	just nothing to write home about .	1	1
1	they were super buttery ... too much so .	1	1
1	wednesday night , september _num_ , _num_ .	1	1
1	i have never been treated so badly as a consumer .	1	1
1	not a great hertz location and they need much better signage and training .	1	1
1	not sure pino 's will get a repeat visit .	1	1
1	this place offers really poor service .	1	1
1	the food was cooked well , but lackluster .	1	1
1	odd , but probably the most efficient .	1	1
1	i also smell a rat .	1	1
1	but , for the extremely low price ... what did i expect .	1	1
1	like over cooked and then sat out for a couple of hours .	1	1
1	it was not good .	1	1
1	what a waste .	1	1
1	worse was that there was no flavor .	1	1
1	the service was n't horrible , it was just slow .	1	1
1	quite possibly the worst airport i 've ever had a layover at .	1	1
1	so not worth the walk that we took to get here .	1	1
1	have you ever been to a sports bar where there is no games on ?	1	1
1	_num_ star : the service was lacking .	1	1
1	the chicken portion was at least half vegetables , which was very disappointing .	1	1
1	my spaghetti was watery and had barely enough sauce to coat the watery noodles .	1	1
1	the bbq was cold and dry .	1	1
1	time warner cable is the worst !	1	1
1	the first time i went with a group of _num_ other friends .	1	1
1	was not allowed to talk to a manager when requested .	1	1
1	the waiter did not even bother to ask if everything was okay .	1	1
1	they were soggy , and not crispy at all .	1	1
1	the potatoes were like tater tots .	1	1
1	that 's not an eatery either .	1	1
1	same with food , souvenirs and entrance tickets .	1	1
1	do not stay here .	1	1
1	egg roll was sour of all things .	1	1
1	looking back , i am glad it happened that way .	1	1
1	not awful but there has to be better places with southern home cooking !	1	1
1	it was just as lousy as the lunch .	1	1
1	then change how you handle your customers .	1	1
1	the toilets are disgusting , and the sauna and steam rooms are never clean .	1	1
1	the little bubble in my head said what does she mean by that response .	1	1
1	rude rude rude .	1	1
1	_num_ . )	1	1
1	the bedroom however seemed to dull car noise a little better .	1	1
1	there was no mention of cheese on the menu for the meal .	1	1
1	are you kidding me ?	1	1
1	described as having crab , lobster and shrimp .	1	1
1	i 'm not italian , but i cook way better than this myself .	1	1
1	man ... really bad from start to finish .	1	1
1	sent one of my companions to get me some water .	1	1
1	i will not be back again to eat .	1	1
1	bad lighting .	1	1
1	not so much .	1	1
1	would never consider going back .	1	1
1	when we called , she was informed that we did get the wings .	1	1
1	drove down there so they could say sorry want to do it tomorrow ?	1	1
1	this place is huge and was moderately clean except the bathrooms .	1	1
1	i did n't have more than a bite or two .	1	1
1	what made it especially awkward - no one was breaking it down .	1	1
1	it was not even blackened .	1	1
1	what the hell ?	1	1
1	but sadly , i do n't see you at all in my future .	1	1
1	nasty .	1	1
1	we stayed for four nights and got minimal cleaning service in our room .	1	1
1	it does n't get any worse than this !	1	1
1	the bread pudding was ice cold and hard as a rock .	1	1
1	there are better options .	1	1
1	however , the reaction that we received was unacceptable .	1	1
1	then customer service wouldnt help me .	1	1
1	my reuben tasted like eating a salt stick .	1	1
1	which i guess explains the attitudes of the staff .	1	1
1	still not worth it !	1	1
1	the rest was mediocre .	1	1
1	the management is horrible and never understanding .	1	1
1	i do not support this unethical business practice .	1	1
1	it was n't even busy and it was on a wednesday night .	1	1
1	when we arrived the hostess was very unpleasant .	1	1
1	if i could give negative stars i would .	1	1
1	bar louie : you are dead to me .	1	1
1	loud is an understatement .	1	1
1	there 's not really an opportunity for any of that at this place .	1	1
1	not many people in there tonight so the selection of pizza seemed minimal tonight .	1	1
1	this one is terrible .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	wo n't be back .	1	1
1	two bugs greeted me as i entered my room .	1	1
1	shower was covered in soap scum .	1	1
1	my real issue is with the eggs they served me .	1	1
1	i will never place an order for me & my coworkers again .	1	1
1	ash trays all over the bar .	1	1
1	but not like it is now .	1	1
1	not an authentic irish bar , by any means .	1	1
1	it was god awful .	1	1
1	not entirely sure what that 's about .	1	1
1	i had a mani pedi today and they were brutal ... .	1	1
1	the galleria ... it 's definitely catered to the upper class .	1	1
1	kind of service that screams for a _num_ % tip .	1	1
1	i did n't feel welcome here .	1	1
1	life is too short .	1	1
1	the table they sat us at , smelled so badly !	1	1
1	despite the good food the customer service has turned me away from this restaurant .	1	1
1	i feel i paid $ _num_ for a $ _num_ meal .	1	1
1	i usually do not like posting negative reviews .	1	1
1	there are just too many misses in my book though .	1	1
1	everything took a long time to come out and the service was very poor .	1	1
1	not worth going so much anymore .	1	1
1	there were _num_ of us .	1	1
1	no apologies .	1	1
1	not a dime every again .	1	1
1	they serve beer and wine !	1	1
1	i think they probably deserve better .	1	1
1	shrimp is either cooked or it 's not .	1	1
1	overall , not worth it .	1	1
1	i went to jiffy lube for a routine oil change .	1	1
1	when two weeks go by , i called to check in .	1	1
1	further , there did n't seem to be any seasoning on the steak .	1	1
1	the table was also sticky and gross !	1	1
1	this was my second time here , and it was a disaster , again .	1	1
1	i 've never tasted something that claimed to be curry with so little flavor .	1	1
1	why in _num_ are hotels still doing this ?	1	1
1	after a noticeable drop in quality , i started ordering elsewhere .	1	1
1	wo n't be returning .	1	1
1	they offered a lifetime warranty , so no future issue would be a problem .	1	1
1	the customer service displayed was some of the worst i have ever seen .	1	1
1	the enchiladas were poorly made and for the most part tasteless .	1	1
1	time to check out and never come back .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	the locals that like this joint must have smoker destroyed taste buds .	1	1
1	pecan crusted trout was tasteless .	1	1
1	very disappointed .	1	1
1	the old location would usually be moderately busy .	1	1
1	why would anyone even pay for such lousy food ?	1	1
1	i walked in and was a little surprised .	1	1
1	just was refused service because we had a large group .	1	1
1	first of all , if i could i would n't give them any stars !	1	1
1	waitress did n't even know until i told her politely .	1	1
1	the menu is n't particularly veg friendly , but it 's not too bad .	1	1
1	the worst pizza i have had .	1	1
1	i ate a little bit , but i did n't want to finish it .	1	1
1	no way , no how .	1	1
1	greasy unappetizing fried food .	1	1
1	it 's tough to be a vegetarian in nc , i guess .	1	1
1	security checks are here to stay , do something about it .	1	1
1	my boyfriend 's general tso 's was less than subpar .	1	1
1	worst chinese i 've had in pittsburgh .	1	1
1	the breading was thicker than the veal .	1	1
1	firstly , the food had no flavor .	1	1
1	i may return if craving a good caesar .	1	1
1	this is the worst customer service i have ever experienced .	1	1
1	update : _num_ hours later and still feel sick from this meal .	1	1
1	absolutely horrible customer service !	1	1
1	i have n't been here in a long time .	1	1
1	i did not feel that the dry cleaning was worth that much .	1	1
1	i got home and no extra sides .	1	1
1	i tried to get a delivery on _num_ separate occasions .	1	1
1	walking on it with shoes on disgusted me .	1	1
1	above all , it was incredibly dirty in there !	1	1
1	but they do n't even seem to have subs .	1	1
1	based on this experience , i would most definitely not recommend this to others .	1	1
1	it was topped with an olive and a mini pickle ... odd .	1	1
1	there i was very disappointed .	1	1
1	absolutely no taste .	1	1
1	on her worst day her cooking never tasted this bad .	1	1
1	super dry and no good flavor other than the cole slaw .	1	1
1	it was _num_ at that point .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	the worst place to rent a car from !	1	1
1	change management and has gone down hill .	1	1
1	however , here is how they contacted me .	1	1
1	never going back to pf changs .	1	1
1	the wedding manager nicole is ok , but nothing special .	1	1
1	this does n't generally happen to me .	1	1
1	now that would have been an improvement .	1	1
1	terrible airport for a layover .	1	1
1	our server , was friendly .	1	1
1	also note they lie when you fight it with your bank .	1	1
1	i 've eaten here several times and they are not very flexible .	1	1
1	my night was ruined thanks to this pizza hut .	1	1
1	average bar food , slow service , a nice selection of incredibly overpriced beers .	1	1
1	i do n't understand why people love this place .	1	1
1	the service was awful .	1	1
1	terrible front desk staff & way over priced .	1	1
1	and for me i 'd rather pay more to get better tasting food .	1	1
1	i believe he is the manager and is n't the most friendly manger .	1	1
1	this is the worst experience ever .	1	1
1	the entree was a dry .	1	1
1	the hallways smell as do the rooms and they are not clean at all .	1	1
1	the waiter was horrible and barely checked on us .	1	1
1	the bill was $ _num_ .	1	1
1	soup was mediocre .	1	1
1	the filet was also not very flavorful but better than the lobster .	1	1
1	not so great ?	1	1
1	not one said would you like some water .	1	1
1	the attempt at adding flavor came with the chipotle mayo and sour cream .	1	1
1	do not go here for waxing !	1	1
1	my family and i were out for a very special occasion .	1	1
1	the service was horrible .	1	1
1	this place sucks .	1	1
1	watery gumbo started off our meals .	1	1
1	this has been a terrible experience .	1	1
1	terrible !	1	1
1	Negative	1	1
1	i wish i could leave zero stars , but that 's not an option .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	dont fall for it .	1	1
1	it 's a shame b/c better service would have made the experience decent .	1	1
1	i guess i was supposed to know that it was closed .	1	1
1	needless to say , i would not recommend them .	1	1
1	the egg rolls were overcooked and almost burnt .	1	1
1	how do you mess up a slice of cheese pizza .	1	1
1	however , their store hours are absolutely terrible .	1	1
1	which was dry , overcooked and lukewarm .	1	1
1	however , the wait staff and food is below average .	1	1
1	tasted bland for what is supposed to be a very flavorful dish .	1	1
1	her corned beef was brown and bad .	1	1
1	i was a bit disappointed with the pizza i got .	1	1
1	$ _num_ side dishes .	1	1
1	this is absolutely the worst place i 've ever been to .	1	1
1	even all other orders were very well below average .	1	1
1	btw ... coffee was $ _num_ .	1	1
1	still not level and only enough room for camper and _num_ vehicle .	1	1
1	if anything goes wrong you 'll get the worst help ever .	1	1
1	sadly it was not .	1	1
1	the second time about 2-3 months later was just awful .	1	1
1	it was awful .	1	1
1	do not take your clothes there because they will damage or lose them .	1	1
1	just dont expect anything amazing .	1	1
1	sent it back and had no time to wait for another dish .	1	1
1	this meal was a disappointment .	1	1
1	our chef was lacking any kind of personality or energy .	1	1
1	please do not go to this salon .	1	1
1	i 'm glad there was more mango than strawberry .	1	1
1	maybe the waitress was having a bad day .	1	1
1	poor service that leaves tenants to fight mildew on their own .	1	1
1	it tasted and smelled like fish .	1	1
1	the egg and cheese were disgusting .	1	1
1	bathrooms are by far the worst i 've ever seen for a public restroom .	1	1
1	the clerk made and error and made the reservations for june .	1	1
1	lidia 's was a major disappointment for me .	1	1
1	i had deep fried batter for lunch !	1	1
1	we were willing to try again , so we went for dinner tonight .	1	1
1	nothing special here .	1	1
1	bland and awful .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	the crust is not homemade , pretty sure .	1	1
1	overall - do not ever stay here if you can avoid it .	1	1
1	nah , just sit there and wait .	1	1
1	if i could give zero stars i would .	1	1
1	each visit was more bizarre than the time before .	1	1
1	it was ready within seven minutes or so , not bad at all .	1	1
1	the building we stayed in was not full .	1	1
1	we never got a call about the reservation time which was annoying .	1	1
1	billing sucks .	1	1
1	i took my prescription to another vendor and had my glasses made .	1	1
1	then the waitress asked me if i knew the chicken itself was spicy .	1	1
1	fail .	1	1
1	first of all , the customer service was great !	1	1
1	not good .	1	1
1	i sent it back - showed the gal my burned pastrami sandwich .	1	1
1	not so !	1	1
1	it 's horrible .	1	1
1	just be sure to make your appointment with someone with experience .	1	1
1	rotten food and over charging customer .	1	1
1	however , the rum killed any blueberry or mint flavor in the drink .	1	1
1	lidia 's does high-end traditional italian without being too pretentious or too predictable .	1	1
1	the menu was prix fixed at $ _num_ .	1	1
1	horrible !	1	1
1	this resort is most definitely not worth the ladies weekend .	1	1
1	too many good italian places in pittsburgh to choose here .	1	1
1	i do n't know if they hate working there or hate serving people .	1	1
1	the goat cheese was nowhere to be found .	1	1
1	i ate as much of the eggplant and meat as i could dig out .	1	1
1	good idea , but poorly executed food .	1	1
1	i would absolutely not return to this salon .	1	1
1	very disappointed in this place .	1	1
1	where do you find apples and feta cheese with no taste ?	1	1
1	this could be an awesome place to stay .	1	1
1	the service is horrible ... friendly but horrible .	1	1
1	i agree _num_ % on maggie g 's review .	1	1
1	never again mad mex south hills !	1	1
1	the burger was just eh .	1	1
1	i walked in sat down , greeted by friendly staff and great decor .	1	1
1	the food is barely ok .	1	1
1	from there , sadly , it began to go downhill .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	for some reason i always have to connect between terminal e and terminal a .	1	1
1	the older man that took us to the table could have done nicer .	1	1
1	it was horrible .	1	1
1	oh primanti 's , you always disappoint !	1	1
1	have you seen the terrible bathroom wallpaper borders ?	1	1
1	i get there only to find out they have nothing ready .	1	1
1	i do not like this company !	1	1
1	i honestly wish i can give this place no stars .	1	1
1	it ruined our first visit in charlotte .	1	1
1	the rest of us ordered the mixed field greens salad which was awful .	1	1
1	there are better places to eat for the same money .	1	1
1	service was ok , birthday dessert was a bowl of whipped cream .	1	1
1	some had flavorless chicken piccata , fish and eggplant parmigiana .	1	1
1	i was towed within _num_ hours after parking back there at ( 10pm ) .	1	1
1	but recently getting really disgusting .	1	1
1	it also does not help that they do not have beer prices listed .	1	1
1	maybe it is just me , but i think it 's overrated .	1	1
1	the place is just older and needs some renovations .	1	1
1	they were essentially fried wontons , not crab rangoon .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	like , below applebee 's bad .	1	1
1	rob then ordered the philly cheese steak sliders .	1	1
1	horrible restaurant .	1	1
1	this place sucked .	1	1
1	bartenders were terrible and not attentive .	1	1
1	order something other than a burger and you do n't get much better .	1	1
1	pity as i like to support the local businesses .	1	1
1	when that was fixed , the lines did n't roll over properly .	1	1
1	i ordered the chicken kabob .	1	1
1	so i 'm not sure how much he 'd approve of this bar .	1	1
1	will not come back here .	1	1
1	disgusting .	1	1
1	i 'm getting pissed now .	1	1
1	the main waiting area is also empty .	1	1
1	your free wi-fi is totally useless .	1	1
1	will not go back .	1	1
1	i end up picking half of my sandwich apart .	1	1
1	tsa security is the worst .	1	1
1	the bartender was the worst experience of the night .	1	1
1	not good .	1	1
1	he was very busy working on multiple people at the same time .	1	1
1	waste of time .	1	1
1	my chicken sandwhich was also made with rubber chicken .	1	1
1	never again well i spend money in this establishment .	1	1
1	i did n't even eat the salad .	1	1
1	furnishings and bedding from the _num_ 's ... if not _num_ 's !	1	1
1	unimpressive food .	1	1
1	my friend 's nails looked like a _num_ year old did them .	1	1
1	olive garden seems like fine dining compared to this place .	1	1
1	_num_ dollars for _num_ people .	1	1
1	this hotel has the worst customer service that i have ever seen .	1	1
1	the bar staff was n't concerned with us and were n't friendly at all .	1	1
1	so not cool steelers !	1	1
1	gross !	1	1
1	i walked back in and asked the guy if my tires had been rotated .	1	1
1	the room had a very strong musty smell and was not the cleanest .	1	1
1	produce could use a makeover .	1	1
1	the doctor prescribed me medication that i am allergic to .	1	1
1	simply put , it is overpriced and not worth your money .	1	1
1	they are out dated and their customer `` service '' is non existent .	1	1
1	unfortunately i can not give less than one .	1	1
1	holy ... cannoli ... get me out of here !	1	1
1	if you do n't leave a tip , then they are rude .	1	1
1	disgusting .	1	1
1	not sure what their structure is for seating , but they suck at it .	1	1
1	left with : big mac , medium fries , no coke .	1	1
1	i will not go back !	1	1
1	awful awful .	1	1
1	the chicken breast was so small .	1	1
1	it was not good at all .	1	1
1	i 'm glad i do n't eat at this restaurant very often .	1	1
1	very disappointed in the customer service .	1	1
1	_num_ minutes later the delivery guy calls and says he 's on his way .	1	1
1	then the manager told me we would not have sold one in the condition .	1	1
1	it was grilled chicken , french fries , a little cheese on chopped lettuce .	1	1
1	no greeter so we were n't sure where to go .	1	1
1	i waffle between _num_ stars and _num_ .	1	1
1	the food is sooooo bland though .	1	1
1	there was no background music .	1	1
1	service was n't too bad - nice people .	1	1
1	unless you 're a local do n't go in there .	1	1
1	very little selection .	1	1
1	_num_ minutes later half of our party needed to leave .	1	1
1	living here has turned out to be a complete nightmare .	1	1
1	a subpar meal and subpar service in addition to false marketing .	1	1
1	your bad attitude and horrible service is part of the reason .	1	1
1	it 's just not worth it .	1	1
1	looked like a bunch of fruit flies made their way into the soup .	1	1
1	total waste of money !	1	1
1	the food was bad !	1	1
1	_num_ for beef basil ?	1	1
1	thanks for giving me one more reason never to come back .	1	1
1	the bread was cold and hard .	1	1
1	and that they were going to charge me $ _num_ for it .	1	1
1	as the other reviewers noted the management is horrible and rude .	1	1
1	the guys here were borderline rude to me when i dropped my car off .	1	1
1	i have not been back .	1	1
1	stopped in on the fourth of july for evening cocktail and small meal .	1	1
1	clt needs improvements in the drop off and pick up areas .	1	1
1	other than that , it needed hemmed and taken out just a touch .	1	1
1	i told him `` just remember , it 's not their fault they suck .	1	1
1	the lady almost asked for the double price after doing the job .	1	1
1	eventually i just gave up .	1	1
1	going downhill ... ... man , what happened to this place ?	1	1
1	lame .	1	1
1	avoid eating or drinking anything here .	1	1
1	our waiter ( vincent ) had _num_ tables .	1	1
1	ca n't recommend the place .	1	1
1	not crispy looking , not seasoned .	1	1
1	this location is the worst and has been for years .	1	1
1	everyone hates it and they do n't care about their community .	1	1
1	for the record ... its not worth $ _num_ .	1	1
1	i assumed it was leaking and brushed it off .	1	1
1	unacceptable .	1	1
1	did someone over rate this place ?	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	we had a reservation for _num_ for a casual business dinner .	1	1
1	no service .	1	1
1	i keep giving them another chance and i keep getting disappointed .	1	1
1	but if you can avoid it , you should .	1	1
1	we had a terrible breakfast here not long ago .	1	1
1	also very over priced .	1	1
1	the wait for _num_ rolls and _num_ pieces of sashimi took over _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	poor results and questionable billing .	1	1
1	i think this should be more like _num_ stars .	1	1
1	a turn off .	1	1
1	but this restaurant was not clean .	1	1
1	my wild mushroom and chicken was not warm but tasted okay .	1	1
1	i wish i could leave a no star rating .	1	1
1	unfortunately , that did n't happen .	1	1
1	the chef , however , needs a bit of training .	1	1
1	out of five orders , only two were done correctly .	1	1
1	maybe we just went to the wrong primanti bros location .	1	1
1	and , crab soup so salty , was not edible .	1	1
1	transfer _num_ , to sales !	1	1
1	and proceeded to scream at her for several minutes .	1	1
1	it is now grossly over priced .	1	1
1	i could not see anything .	1	1
1	so disappointed .	1	1
1	the place was very busy and noisy .	1	1
1	tables were dirty .	1	1
1	fish tacos were recommended and were basically fried fish sticks .	1	1
1	this place is a mess .	1	1
1	this use to be the go to place because the food was always consistent .	1	1
1	i have spent a lot of time at shooting ranges both indoors and out .	1	1
1	i never tasted such an overwhelming orange dish in my life .	1	1
1	you 're better off taking your money elsewhere .	1	1
1	of course , i 'm not sure it was really chicken .	1	1
1	the tv movies did n't work ?	1	1
1	worst mcdonalds i have ever been to .	1	1
1	as the website states , with asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes .	1	1
1	when we said something there was one excuse after another !	1	1
1	our _num_ year old was so bored that she wanted to leave .	1	1
1	we are talking a plain bottle with mystery ketchup .	1	1
1	sorry guys you really need to repair the beer machine and hire a cook .	1	1
1	cold cheese and cold pepperoni on my pizza ?	1	1
1	i 'm sorry .	1	1
1	perhaps the main chef was not working on the weekday night i was there .	1	1
1	and it 's pretty gross inside .	1	1
1	unfortunately , i hung up feeling like a major inconvenience .	1	1
1	after they microwaved it it was barely fit to eat .	1	1
1	_num_ sides came out late .	1	1
1	this place looks like it was frozen in _num_ .	1	1
1	pancakes were not very good .	1	1
1	this is the worst taco bell i 've ever been to .	1	1
1	the staff is rude .	1	1
1	first the woman rushed through my `` manicure . ''	1	1
1	i then turned around and walked out .	1	1
1	my girlfriend walked here to get change for laundry .	1	1
1	tv was newer , but remote was terrible .	1	1
1	check-in at the hilton university place was a breeze .	1	1
1	this is not one of them .	1	1
1	horrible service , less than friendly would be putting it mildly !	1	1
1	this is not even worthy of the name .	1	1
1	i get better shrimp pasta at macaroni grill !	1	1
1	it was by far the worst experience at a restaurant i have had .	1	1
1	poor service and food .	1	1
1	this used to be my favorite place uptown .	1	1
1	i think i chose wrong .	1	1
1	the parking lot is miserable .	1	1
1	why the hell was there a wait ?	1	1
1	actually that is n't quite accurate .	1	1
1	i do not recommend south charlotte animal hospital .	1	1
1	my gripe here is that i ended up with scratches on my wheels .	1	1
1	my children ordered chicken nuggets , they were burnt .	1	1
1	i would not stay here again .	1	1
1	this airport is having a terrible time with the parking solution right now .	1	1
1	what a waste !	1	1
1	do n't waste your time .	1	1
1	the pasta is consistently overcooked .	1	1
1	i do n't know what is happening to medicine patients appointments etc .	1	1
1	i only stopped because i needed ta repair that day and they were close .	1	1
1	the sandwich looks like someone sat on it .	1	1
1	the pool is strictly a lap pool .	1	1
1	i sent it back and walked out .	1	1
1	this is the worst lay out ever for a bar .	1	1
1	the visit i am reviewing was for take-out .	1	1
1	not very friendly to start .	1	1
1	but i 'm really disappointed .	1	1
1	needless to say , there are plenty if better options around .	1	1
1	needless to say , i will not be back again .	1	1
1	the pizza was just sweet without much other taste , almost like ketchup !	1	1
1	it was not especially crowded ( no wait ) and we had reservations .	1	1
1	just in the way it is laid out and with the choices .	1	1
1	will not go back to carowinds !	1	1
1	not again for me .	1	1
1	and turn around and walk the hell out of there , seriously .	1	1
1	car seats were dirty and old .	1	1
1	i went here for sunday brunch trusting all the good yelp reviews .	1	1
1	the place appears dirty , the service is not friendly .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	i wish there was a zero star option to give .	1	1
1	found out he left less than a month after this incident .	1	1
1	probably the worst value around .	1	1
1	the employees , by and large , could care less about customer service .	1	1
1	this was by far the worst hotel experience i 've ever had .	1	1
1	so , i got a turkey sandwich with the coleslaw and fries on it .	1	1
1	ridiculous .	1	1
1	their close proximity does n't win out over quality .	1	1
1	go to any other pharmacy in town , avoid giant eagle .	1	1
1	the bathroom is total trash .	1	1
1	waitress never apologized .	1	1
1	i had to walk around the whole restaurant to find my husband .	1	1
1	it was torture .	1	1
1	i will not try them again .	1	1
1	it must have been _num_ - _num_ minutes before it came .	1	1
1	the dishes that night were sub-par , which was a first .	1	1
1	smh ... customer service is clearly not on their priority list .	1	1
1	first bite the crust was almost raw , dense , and way too chewy .	1	1
1	the only other bartender was slowly walking around the other end of the bar .	1	1
1	the portions are pretty small , and sauces are bland .	1	1
1	it 's not that delish .	1	1
1	just not a good value for the $ .	1	1
1	long story short , we wo n't be back .	1	1
1	north carolina , this is n't looking good for you thus far .	1	1
1	shame on you cathy !	1	1
1	_num_ . )	1	1
1	it was a neon pink color and tasted like dried out chewy dog food .	1	1
1	the bathrooms are horrible and the coffee stations are nasty .	1	1
1	way overpriced for just ok food .	1	1
1	buses are late all the time .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	she walked up the stairs and ignored us .	1	1
1	walked into the smallest waiting area i 've ever seen in a sit-down establishment .	1	1
1	as for the food , price does not fit the quality or size .	1	1
1	linda is a quite arrogant woman with bad attitude .	1	1
1	the guy was obviously knowledgable about mattresses but he was rude and condescending .	1	1
1	no thanks .	1	1
1	tonight was a miserable time here .	1	1
1	very little apology from the staff about the horrible experience .	1	1
1	the very odd thing about the sauce was that it was too sweet .	1	1
1	i would consider a _num_ star rating if it were n't for them .	1	1
1	it was cold and old food .	1	1
1	very slow night only _num_ people there .	1	1
1	unacceptable .	1	1
1	this hotel is really dated , and the rooms smell funny .	1	1
1	the stylist did n't come back after a couple minutes .	1	1
1	why on earth did i go back to this restaurant ?	1	1
1	still , i was n't blown away by it .	1	1
1	take the extra _num_ minutes to drive to the south hills location .	1	1
1	essentially for me , it 's like fast food quality .	1	1
1	what a complete waste .	1	1
1	almost thought i was in los angeles again .	1	1
1	`` kelly '' is rude .	1	1
1	well , this too was a massive disappointment .	1	1
1	this pf changs needs new management !	1	1
1	_num_ minutes later our appetizers came out but no kids meal !	1	1
1	not really sure why they call this place the french quarter .	1	1
1	no hostess coming up .	1	1
1	i have never spent so much money to look this bad .	1	1
1	i settled with the thai fried rice with beef .	1	1
1	i 'm dissatisfied !	1	1
1	the bread was just sliced supermarket bread .	1	1
1	a while later , the waitress refilled our drinks .	1	1
1	she was surly and very uninterested in doing her job .	1	1
1	worst customer service .	1	1
1	i was quickly greeted by paul - who was great !	1	1
1	the produce is not very fresh and the meats never looks good .	1	1
1	this place makes you feel unwelcome and dumb .	1	1
1	i wo n't be back .	1	1
1	even with $ _num_ groupon for $ _num_ its still overpriced ... ... .	1	1
1	just awful .	1	1
1	and i quickly remembered why !	1	1
1	i was underwhelmed but my coworkers raved about their dishes .	1	1
1	i would never give these people my money again .	1	1
1	very disappointed .	1	1
1	needless to say , we wo n't be going back for quite some time !	1	1
1	stupid is not a good enough word to describe that suggestion .	1	1
1	it took _num_ months for them to resolve this situation .	1	1
1	it was impossible to tell what type of meat it was .	1	1
1	to be honest this place was not that good at all .	1	1
1	i made reservations for nye probably around _num_ weeks in advance .	1	1
1	do not use these people for your dry cleaning needs !	1	1
1	i feel like she treated me like a criminal .	1	1
1	i would n't recommend going here .	1	1
1	we also shared a pasta dish which was incredibly overpriced .	1	1
1	no real kids menu .	1	1
1	their televisions could be called outdated ... at best .	1	1
1	will not be back to that location !	1	1
1	literally the worst experience ever .	1	1
1	if both of those conditions are n't true , then go anywhere else .	1	1
1	the food is disgusting .	1	1
1	`` ill tell the waitress . ''	1	1
1	she was waited on before us and no apology was given .	1	1
1	it was n't the best but it was n't the worst .	1	1
1	this would easy go for $ _num_ at other places during lunch .	1	1
1	the food can be somewhat disappointing but will sometimes do in a pinch .	1	1
1	yet , he comes back with extra texas pete drenched on my wings .	1	1
1	so , i decided to go with _num_ hotcakes .	1	1
1	extremely disappointed .	1	1
1	no one wanted to complain as it was a customer event .	1	1
1	as i left i suggested the manager change this policy .	1	1
1	my girlfriend had a similarly bland meal .	1	1
1	we ate breakfast food at 2:30 am after the bars closed .	1	1
1	smelled like urine .	1	1
1	very rude .	1	1
1	this location does not have good service .	1	1
1	time warner cable is awful .	1	1
1	-the cable tv went out every _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	this is a depressing coffee shop .	1	1
1	actually , this is n't even a bad review .	1	1
1	her first bite she made a sour face .	1	1
1	and now i realize why i only come here after a night of drinking .	1	1
1	very very slow service .	1	1
1	somehow still managed to spend _num_ bucks a head .	1	1
1	horrible !	1	1
1	then refused to call m & p to talk to the manager .	1	1
1	go for drinks and nothing more .	1	1
1	personal hygiene was n't on the menu that night !	1	1
1	worst service i 've ever had !	1	1
1	we ended up throwing out about _num_ % of what we paid for .	1	1
1	this property has gotten very tired .	1	1
1	there are much better choices in uptown charlotte !	1	1
1	i guess a lot of people like it , and more power too them .	1	1
1	the servers are rude and slow , and the food is awful .	1	1
1	there are too many decent pizza delivery places around to settle for this .	1	1
1	i had to special order my salad and take off a bunch of junk .	1	1
1	my husband ordered the margarita pizza & i ordered the shrimp tacos with rice .	1	1
1	we will not order from this place again , sorry .	1	1
1	i do n't get it .	1	1
1	i was mildly annoyed because i do n't think she even acknowledged my presence .	1	1
1	instead of offering napkins the girl just shut the window & turned around .	1	1
1	i did n't even answer them back .	1	1
1	as one of the reviewers mentioned the breakfast was very oily .	1	1
1	i was hard put to give _num_ % tip to be honest .	1	1
1	she looked as if she was forced to be there !	1	1
1	we also asked for extra ice and such , but our waitress never remembered .	1	1
1	my friends had left this woman at least a _num_ % tip .	1	1
1	they could n't find the driver .	1	1
1	i expected bland sushi .	1	1
1	since they apparently hire good people , hire more !	1	1
1	i was presented with ... an empty plate .	1	1
1	what we got at long last was so disappointing .	1	1
1	i had the spaghetti with italian sausage .	1	1
1	the person i was with , asked the server for gravy .	1	1
1	honestly i 'm not sure what the big rave is about this place .	1	1
1	so far ... not so good .	1	1
1	they had no high chairs so we had to wait .	1	1
1	if it were free , i would probably still pass .	1	1
1	the beginning check in should 've been a red flag for us to run .	1	1
1	but over the years it has gone down hill .	1	1
1	the restaurant is located in the basement of a building off of walnut street .	1	1
1	so , my wife got up and we walked out of this place .	1	1
1	the corned beef is nothing great and their side dishes are nothing special .	1	1
1	it does n't feel fair .	1	1
1	not by a long shot .	1	1
1	there is no sense of customer service at this store .	1	1
1	the dining room always looks closed .	1	1
1	after 5+ years a friend that `` loves '' it talked me into it .	1	1
1	if you can , avoid the surly dude there fine most of the time .	1	1
1	i used my apartment as essentially a storage unit until my lease expired .	1	1
1	so , i am assuming they were delivered by a neighbor .	1	1
1	it will only get worse .	1	1
1	do n't bother with this place .	1	1
1	the beef was not the right color and was basically bland .	1	1
1	parking is difficult to come by , and you have to pay .	1	1
1	the first time was so-so , the second time was better .	1	1
1	at this point , my patience are very thin .	1	1
1	i dunno .	1	1
1	side order of buffalo chicken strips .	1	1
1	worst place ever !	1	1
1	of course it was good , it is fried cheese !	1	1
1	this place has none of them .	1	1
1	but i strongly believe that the staff in their housekeeping department are not honest .	1	1
1	terrible service !	1	1
1	then tons of school kids were breaking lines and nothing being done .	1	1
1	they were not seasoned well .	1	1
1	there was no one filling up water .	1	1
1	the rice was burnt and the beef and broccoli was very salty .	1	1
1	menus for drinks and food have no prices .	1	1
1	the restaurant was about half full , i was with one other person .	1	1
1	food is ok but not worth a trip over to this joint .	1	1
1	your menu is n't that big !	1	1
1	not good at all .	1	1
1	the place is very cozy .	1	1
1	for the price of everything , it was not worth it all .	1	1
1	just so bland !	1	1
1	the pizza is very soggy and the salad is brown and mostly inedible .	1	1
1	she just disappeared again .	1	1
1	the place was totally dusty and there was no ac .	1	1
1	so i might not be the target audience .	1	1
1	in my opinion , do your shopping elsewhere .	1	1
1	the cheese pie was pretty bad .	1	1
1	their chips and salsa is bad .	1	1
1	so i would n't go back .	1	1
1	glad i tried this place but wo n't rush back .	1	1
1	i was n't pleased with it .	1	1
1	always slow .	1	1
1	take it from me ; avoid this place at all cost .	1	1
1	crowded with narrow walkways .	1	1
1	cleanliness is not a priority here .	1	1
1	they said there are no tomatoes on that sandwich .	1	1
1	_num_ stars because the beer was good .	1	1
1	probably all the same sauce anyway .	1	1
1	i spent $ _num_ for only one edible thing worth $ _num_ .	1	1
1	the hostess told me that there were not three ladies sitting together .	1	1
1	we called again and he said that they could n't find our car keys .	1	1
1	why did you return there if you were so unhappy , you might ask .	1	1
1	also , my package was stolen twice .	1	1
1	the reply was the owners wo n't let us buy anything .	1	1
1	disappointing .	1	1
1	this place is below par in just about every way .	1	1
1	not crispy but chewy and not very salty .	1	1
1	the worst part is that this is the corporate store for the area .	1	1
1	a lunch over charged and wasted .	1	1
1	they may also want to schedule a couple more servers on a saturday night .	1	1
1	i would like to stress again though that my feet look awesome .	1	1
1	i chose a veggie wrap , sans cheese with a side of apple sauce .	1	1
1	the primary reason i used to visit this store was to fill medical prescriptions .	1	1
1	i 'm only giving _num_ stars because the optometrist was fine .	1	1
1	linda did not call .	1	1
1	hotel was clean and service was meh .	1	1
1	to make matters worse , i got sick later that night from the food .	1	1
1	i did n't understand why he was asking that or the reason .	1	1
1	just is n't the same , maybe they sold ?	1	1
1	be a gold member so you do n't waste any more time .	1	1
1	room decor is old and bed was not comfortable .	1	1
1	this is not a review about papa johns in general .	1	1
1	but the bacon was under cooked and pretty soggy .	1	1
1	this guy seems nice but he 's actually not .	1	1
1	i will not be returning .	1	1
1	yes , bland .	1	1
1	food lion missed the boat big time with this decision .	1	1
1	the worst part were the soy beans .	1	1
1	we had the same experience when we walked in .	1	1
1	and we could have been loyal customers for years to come .	1	1
1	it was good thing we was on vacation so we had time to waste .	1	1
1	i was ; however , charged for the basket .	1	1
1	some drivers can be surly or just downright ignorant .	1	1
1	disgusting food .	1	1
1	made numerous phone calls and emails saying the problem was being addressed .	1	1
1	the worst service ever .	1	1
1	horrible .	1	1
1	very rude .	1	1
1	they said that each vegetable would be $ _num_ each .	1	1
1	upstairs and outside areas are tight too .	1	1
1	Neutral	1	1
1	the pasta itself was good , but the sauce ruined everything .	1	1
1	the tomato was hard as rock .	1	1
1	i will not be back to see year people again !	1	1
1	there was some improvement for awhile , but it has gotten worse .	1	1
1	some of the worst customer service i 've ever experienced .	1	1
1	not up to it 's previous brunch standards .	1	1
1	i decided to play it safe and ordered the broccoli in garlic sauce .	1	1
1	i would have given it _num_ stars .	1	1
1	when did simply enjoying the company of your companions fall out of favor ?	1	1
1	the food was terrible .	1	1
1	since then , the service level has always been horrible in this store .	1	1
1	i asked for medium cooked and they gave me burnt .	1	1
1	it 's fishy , but it 's not coming from the lake .	1	1
1	the only thing i found good was the plain rice .	1	1
1	if you want extra extra slow service , go to this burger king .	1	1
1	none of our food was good .	1	1
1	if i was _num_ i would have beat his ass over that .	1	1
1	the most disappointing aspect of our visit was the smoked beef brisket .	1	1
1	however , the management is very lacking .	1	1
1	( no where on the contract does it state that ! )	1	1
1	service here on a saturday night was atrocious .	1	1
1	they are a hot mess .	1	1
1	you know what was the worst thing , though ?	1	1
1	food is ok but the service is a thumb down .	1	1
1	this restaurant is not my number _num_ choice .	1	1
1	in fact , just about everything here tasted like something else .	1	1
1	it makes me very unhappy .	1	1
1	the sauce was too vinegary for my taste .	1	1
1	i honestly can not see giving this establishment a rating higher than a _num_ .	1	1
1	rude , unprofessional , and lazy .	1	1
1	went for dinner tonight and was disgusted .	1	1
1	would i go back again ?	1	1
1	_num_ minutes later we had still not been acknowledged .	1	1
1	i have been a customer of sesame inn for many , many years .	1	1
1	such a waste of time .	1	1
1	otherwise , it would have been a _num_ or _num_ .	1	1
1	they did n't even deserve a one star .	1	1
1	the bread is the best part , which is really sad .	1	1
1	every dish we had was completely flavorless .	1	1
1	my burger was well done and dry .	1	1
1	the paper got thinner and thinner for a city the size of charlotte .	1	1
1	food sucked .	1	1
1	apparently old cookies are standard here .	1	1
1	do n't bother .	1	1
1	menu is typical bar food .	1	1
1	the biggest negative about rock bottom is by far the service .	1	1
1	pretty hard to mess up a side salad .	1	1
1	iceberg lettuce , croutons , cucumbers , and dry swordfish .	1	1
1	we ordered the `` pitt burger '' and boy was it disappointing .	1	1
1	it was like getting a shitty breakfast in a local sub dive bar .	1	1
1	at that point i was ready to leave .	1	1
1	no appointments available for tomorrow .	1	1
1	the `` customer '' service and pharmacy are terrible at this location !	1	1
1	no apologies when we were finally taken care of .	1	1
1	i said attempt because they did n't have much to offer .	1	1
1	i usually only stop there if i 'm already at tend waterfront .	1	1
1	no more trying out different thai places in the city .	1	1
1	so , why did i only give them two stars ?	1	1
1	he gave me a confirmation number and everything seemed fine .	1	1
1	the service was also only marginal .	1	1
1	this place is a pittsburgh legend u got ta stop in .	1	1
1	i just want to be done with these apartments .	1	1
1	this is unacceptable .	1	1
1	also the inside is dirty as heck .	1	1
1	then a few staffing changes , and things started going downhill .	1	1
1	should always tip cause they do n't really get paid by the restaurant .	1	1
1	luckily i do n't mind coke ... .	1	1
1	if i wanted to i could buy this place .	1	1
1	it was terrible .	1	1
1	Neutral	1	1
1	no wonder the service was horrible !	1	1
1	the high prices and poor treatment do n't add up .	1	1
1	nothing special about this place .	1	1
1	i would always suggest it when friends asked me where to go .	1	1
1	i had not seen it before but though it looked very quiet .	1	1
1	the food ranges from mediocre to bland .	1	1
1	the service was incredibly slow .	1	1
1	i went in to ship a package that i needed to return to amazon .	1	1
1	your lucky to get a _num_ out of _num_ !	1	1
1	all cities are not the same .	1	1
1	their salads and breadsticks are the only real reason to go there anymore ... !	1	1
1	if i could give this place less than one star i would .	1	1
1	very strange place .	1	1
1	i am _num_ months pregnant and ordered green curry for take out from here .	1	1
1	rented a car over a month ago for our flight into charlotte at 6pm .	1	1
1	no one was at the door to greet me .	1	1
1	why would you even try to seat us like that ?	1	1
1	confusing terminal approach and rental car return area .	1	1
1	i give them a _num_ for presentation .	1	1
1	i then asked to see what they had in the price they offered me .	1	1
1	cost us _num_ bucks for _num_ orders of ribs with one side and soda .	1	1
1	the service was terrible .	1	1
1	i really never want to return .	1	1
1	my friend got an italian sub that was ok .	1	1
1	i hate complaining like this .	1	1
1	this was the single worst thai meal i have ever had in my life .	1	1
1	not worth the price for the lousy service we received .	1	1
1	the dough has that typical bad salty cracker pittsburgh type taste to it .	1	1
1	these people are very difficult to do business with .	1	1
1	my boyfriend ordered eggs with bacon and toast and complained about the same things .	1	1
1	do not stay here .	1	1
1	it was really hot that day so it was pretty uncomfortable .	1	1
1	was going to try the buffalo pizza .	1	1
1	maybe it 's just the other buildings that are awful ... who knows .	1	1
1	tried to buy a book and have it shipped as a christmas present .	1	1
1	what 's worse , i found a scratch on the side later .	1	1
1	the same style etc , just a different ring that fit .	1	1
1	i had to put some hot sauce on there just to get a kick .	1	1
1	way too much money for the wrong stuff !	1	1
1	disgusting .	1	1
1	the portions are quite generous but the presentation was way off for me .	1	1
1	worst mcdonald 's ever .	1	1
1	never come to clt on monday morning .	1	1
1	i would n't return or recommend this place .	1	1
1	tough cheese mostly tasteless and chewy .	1	1
1	the service , however , was terrible .	1	1
1	guess not .	1	1
1	i will definitely not visit this place ever again .	1	1
1	this place has gone significantly down hill .	1	1
1	sad too i used to love outback .	1	1
1	i am a gold member at hertz .	1	1
1	the worst bakery i ever shopped in !	1	1
1	there really was n't anything in particular that stood out that was horrible .	1	1
1	we 've requested work orders _num_ weeks ago and still nothing has been done .	1	1
1	worst customer service ever !	1	1
1	that will be ignored and you will wait like everyone else .	1	1
1	i denied the managers offer to send it back .	1	1
1	overall , not a great choice .	1	1
1	no such luck .	1	1
1	service was slow , just getting a drink was an effort .	1	1
1	didnt really seem like the cared either .	1	1
1	did n't matter that our food was n't correct and our drinks were empty .	1	1
1	this is not the first time i 've had this kind of service there .	1	1
1	food has never made me feel that way .	1	1
1	baked eggplant caprese : the breaded eggplant was a soggy mess .	1	1
1	looks and taste both scored a _num_ out of _num_ .	1	1
1	i waited _num_ minutes while being ignored by the receptionists .	1	1
1	this place needs an iron fist .	1	1
1	but still way way too crowded .	1	1
1	ghetto , the server kept calling me baby all night .	1	1
1	it 's my fault , i guess .	1	1
1	i ca n't believe people rate this four stars on average .	1	1
1	the inside of the resturant is cramped and poorly maintained .	1	1
1	avoid if you can .	1	1
1	i do n't understand the hype with this place .	1	1
1	i wo n't be going back to see him again .	1	1
1	if you 're coming to eat ... ah you might think again !	1	1
1	the shrimp in the fish and chips were just terrible .	1	1
1	my boyfriend had the salmon patties which he said were just ok .	1	1
1	you could probably walk it by then , twice .	1	1
1	i vote anywhere else .	1	1
1	poor service and the food was overpriced for the quality .	1	1
1	the service is terrible .	1	1
1	i was encouraged when we walked in and saw individual tvs on each table .	1	1
1	this was the worst customer service i have encountered in awhile .	1	1
1	skip this place - there are other decent cheap eats downtown .	1	1
1	the place is dirty too .	1	1
1	pitiful service .	1	1
1	starbucks is not the right one for me .	1	1
1	the selection looked appetizing , but tasted horrible .	1	1
1	you will not be disappointed like you will here .	1	1
1	she went to go get them and never returned .	1	1
1	unfair _num_ mins refund before you even see a room .	1	1
1	this particular store sets the bar to a new low .	1	1
1	the tree died .	1	1
1	gross !	1	1
1	got the chicken parm sub as recommended by yelpers .	1	1
1	i will not be working with carolina appliance service again .	1	1
1	the young man behind the bar did n't look of age , either .	1	1
1	it looked like someone 's basement or garage with tables in it .	1	1
1	i 'm a little confused .	1	1
1	why does this place get voted best breakfast ?	1	1
1	i 'm glad i had to run through between flights .	1	1
1	i 'm not going to finish it .	1	1
1	i did n't check in so i have never waited in line at tsa .	1	1
1	avoid !	1	1
1	i very much regret ever trying this salon .	1	1
1	my boyfriend and i went to dinner here last saturday .	1	1
1	i was extremely disappointed w/ my experience at alexander 's last evening .	1	1
1	however this dish ( cajun platter ) lacked any type of cajun spices .	1	1
1	avoid this place at all costs .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	the server and chef were very efficient and personable .	1	1
1	very poor service .	1	1
1	then i wait for someone to come on the line .	1	1
1	it was just me and my mom and i just wanted to browse .	1	1
1	apart from that , the staff lacks any work ethic or customer service .	1	1
1	tip : avoid the ground floor if you are concerned about security .	1	1
1	the food was bland at best .	1	1
1	now i had a $ _num_ salad and $ _num_ pasta trio .	1	1
1	not recommended and officially denied going forward .	1	1
1	however , the doors are closed and locked shut .	1	1
1	mac & cheese was watery .	1	1
1	glad this is all over .	1	1
1	strawberry pies being the exception to the rule .	1	1
1	overall , not impressed .	1	1
1	hate the place !	1	1
1	i would n't go back .	1	1
1	the service here is almost always terrible .	1	1
1	i went as part of a group so did not really have a choice .	1	1
1	this is the worst line i have ever seen in my life .	1	1
1	would have rather spent $ _num_ elsewhere .	1	1
1	not like super cheap but the menu has variety .	1	1
1	i 'm definitely not coming back .	1	1
1	the service , on the other hand , was terrible .	1	1
1	it came out of the kitchen with noodles instead of the potatoes .	1	1
1	i advise everyone to stay away from this scam company .	1	1
1	although i would have to say the pretzel bite appetizer was n't bad .	1	1
1	but i could n't eat it .	1	1
1	this is the first and only showmars i 've visited .	1	1
1	i was starving so at this point i just made do .	1	1
1	two different people in my office were reduced to tears .	1	1
1	the food was lukewarm when it arrived at the table .	1	1
1	they both said they were pretty good , if not a little dry .	1	1
1	brandy was the worst .	1	1
1	sorry but it 's nc law .	1	1
1	the pizza was really greasy , and the bacon was minimal .	1	1
1	the worst macaroni grill i 've ever been to !	1	1
1	did not stick around to argue .	1	1
1	i expected to wait _num_ hours so technically they were early !	1	1
1	but no one seemed happy or to be taking pride in their work .	1	1
1	the food was absolutely gross !	1	1
1	tastes like crap but whatever , they serve it .	1	1
1	this makes no sense .	1	1
1	for last minute we had the one queen bed room and it was awful .	1	1
1	they said they have no idea where the dogs are now .	1	1
1	no accessible stalls in restrooms .	1	1
1	burgers are fair and salads are pretty bad .	1	1
1	a word of warning for customers here .	1	1
1	ugly .	1	1
1	all noodle , no filler .	1	1
1	get your story straight if you are gon na lie .	1	1
1	simply terrible .	1	1
1	you ca n't eat pancakes with your hand .	1	1
1	i got the steamed chicken dumplings and a order of edamame to go .	1	1
1	never fear , she sold us a ticket .	1	1
1	there were clothes all over the ground and nothing was folded .	1	1
1	this is a pretty big hotel , so that is ridiculous .	1	1
1	conference rooms were poorly set-up , freezing cold , and loud !	1	1
1	ugh .	1	1
1	the burger was so-so with little flavor , which was very disappointing .	1	1
1	unfortunately , the second visit was n't any better .	1	1
1	the sushi is not worth your time .	1	1
1	this place has gone down hill fast !	1	1
1	worst experience of my families life .	1	1
1	the lady who runs the office is unpleasant and rude .	1	1
1	i ordered a _num_ oz .	1	1
1	just my _num_ cents .	1	1
1	furthermore , the stuff in the bakery and goodies are below par .	1	1
1	i was very disappointed last night .	1	1
1	`` if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . ''	1	1
1	to be honest with you nothing really jumped off the menu to me .	1	1
1	at times we could barely hear ourselves think , let alone hear each other .	1	1
1	if we had been drinking we would n't care .	1	1
1	he never responded to my call for repairs .	1	1
1	side note : the service was phenomenal , no problems in that department .	1	1
1	my water glass had onion pieces in the bottom of it .	1	1
1	Neutral	1	1
1	our chicken was flavorless and rubbery .	1	1
1	so we got up and walked out .	1	1
1	cold .	1	1
1	do not use , awful experience !	1	1
1	i only go in to buy six packs .	1	1
1	salsa were runny and definitely not spicy .	1	1
1	my caesar salad was sour and otherwise bland .	1	1
1	visit another club , this one is n't it !	1	1
1	it less than _num_ minutes to cook both the burgers and fries .	1	1
1	for $ _num_ plus delivery ?	1	1
1	this was some of the worst pizza i 've ever had .	1	1
1	gross as it was , i understand that mistakes happen .	1	1
1	ca n't beat it .	1	1
1	i was pretty disappointed with this place .	1	1
1	only once was it under par .	1	1
1	so i called on monday to get a real person .	1	1
1	can i give this place zero stars ?	1	1
1	even so the drinks took _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	sub par at best , go to any of the other big burrito restaurants .	1	1
1	i ordered a long john which looked pretty good .	1	1
1	now it 's just crap .	1	1
1	chicken was pretty good though .	1	1
1	the walls are dark and decorated with wood and stained glass .	1	1
1	i had eaten here before and it was much better in the past .	1	1
1	rude , disrespectful jerks who should not be dealing with the public .	1	1
1	the sushi was n't rolled tight either .	1	1
1	taste was just ok.	1	1
1	imagine _num_ chinese food menus blowing through the parking lot , not cool .	1	1
1	left feeling like it was not a good deal at all .	1	1
1	so , this was definitely a reason to try this restaurant out .	1	1
1	the food was terrible and way overpriced .	1	1
1	the bartender working seemed annoyed by our presence .	1	1
1	suggestions : clean up your unprofessional and rude staff !	1	1
1	while they are remodeling this is no longer a business class hotel .	1	1
1	the coffee was stale .	1	1
1	no mushrooms .	1	1
1	the truffles had two salted , one of which was milk chocolate .	1	1
1	they 're big , but again nothing special .	1	1
1	folks , stay away from this place .	1	1
1	children _num_ and under are free .	1	1
1	so that was ridiculous right off the bat .	1	1
1	thank you for your horrible customer service i will never be back.	1	1
1	when there were _num_ other counters that people could have been working .	1	1
1	she suggested we grab some wine and take it back into the market .	1	1
1	every time we have eaten here , we were hungry shortly after .	1	1
1	so at this point we were a little taken back but continued in .	1	1
1	the quality was horrible .	1	1
1	if they say yes , the bread is likely to be eaten .	1	1
1	did n't see a manager until after 10:30 pm .	1	1
1	do n't get me wrong ... the food is not atrocious .	1	1
1	the clothes are priced far higher than other such shops .	1	1
1	that 's why i 'm looking for my cup now .	1	1
1	when to pay is confusing .	1	1
1	it just is n't up my alley though .	1	1
1	our lease ended on april 3rd and everything went smoothly .	1	1
1	but there was no one there .	1	1
1	no gates .	1	1
1	i only took _num_ bite and did n't want anymore .	1	1
1	the food is horrible .	1	1
1	never going back .	1	1
1	i needed a cut so i went for it anyway .	1	1
1	went for lunch for hoagie , fries and _num_ cuts .	1	1
1	she would n't give me an answer .	1	1
1	salon has changed hands ( again ) and not for better .	1	1
1	if you do n't have the time just go next door to the subway .	1	1
1	the common areas ( lobby , breakfast area , hallway ) were nice .	1	1
1	the service was slow and lukewarm .	1	1
1	because i really want to like harris grill .	1	1
1	but ultimately it should be about the food should n't it ?	1	1
1	now , i am stuck due to the heavy fees it would cost .	1	1
1	i would not recommend purchasing extras online .	1	1
1	i got the fried chicken with greens and beans .	1	1
1	rented a car on the way back for $ _num_ bucks with budget .	1	1
1	now it 's just more expensive .	1	1
1	my appetizer was cajun shrimp , which was way over seasoned .	1	1
1	every time , we have a worse experience with customer service .	1	1
1	but , something happened sadly .	1	1
1	_num_ stars .	1	1
1	even the chips and salsa are n't terribly good .	1	1
1	their menu does n't include really any .	1	1
1	booked an appointment , and they fixed the issue .	1	1
1	sorry allison b , ai n't no butter here .	1	1
1	she also split a small mushroom pizza with my dad which was above average .	1	1
1	i would n't stay there again for what it cost .	1	1
1	the boyfriend lives down the street and we went for breakfast today .	1	1
1	average service , below average food and terrible atmosphere .	1	1
1	this marriott kind of feels like an airport hotel .	1	1
1	and it was over $ _num_ for lunch .	1	1
1	did n't havana go out of biz ?	1	1
1	customer service sucks .	1	1
1	the phone call from the manager @ 7:00 am ruined the trip for me .	1	1
1	other than that , this place is grimy , creepy , and nasty .	1	1
1	not sure if the manager makes th e employees clean or not !	1	1
1	made a reservation in may through expedia , which i needed to cancel .	1	1
1	took _num_ hours for one pizza to be delivered .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	this location was completely overcrowded and dirty .	1	1
1	i wo n't be back .	1	1
1	said something to manager and they did n't care .	1	1
1	i could n't agree more .	1	1
1	i asked for my money back .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	no apology .	1	1
1	i am appalled by the lack of customer service and rude interaction i received .	1	1
1	will never stop here again .	1	1
1	could n't do that !	1	1
1	still no fair and normal customer service offered to me ?	1	1
1	we could not leave it on while gone from the room .	1	1
1	would not recommend .	1	1
1	i was highly disappointed .	1	1
1	in the future i 'll stick with scoops for my neighborhood ice cream fix .	1	1
1	wrong again .	1	1
1	so , today , zero stars , but overall two .	1	1
1	the service here sucks .	1	1
1	this is really frustrating , especially at this time of day .	1	1
1	i could go on forever .	1	1
1	how can you mess up a hot dog ?	1	1
1	if you are here to eat , maybe try somewhere else .	1	1
1	wish me luck guys .	1	1
1	as it were , i was n't impressed .	1	1
1	different people wash and dry your hair .	1	1
1	we did n't care for the atmosphere and did n't actually eat anything .	1	1
1	but one is supposed to come here for steak .	1	1
1	i called in two cold sandwiches and was told it would be _num_ mins .	1	1
1	the actual body work seemed okay , i did n't closely inspect it .	1	1
1	i absolutely hate this place .	1	1
1	dealing with the service advisor at this dealership is useless .	1	1
1	this time was n't so great .	1	1
1	by the time they were cooked , everyone was finished eating .	1	1
1	i gave her a call and she did n't pick up .	1	1
1	it took _num_ minutes just to get our waters .	1	1
1	not going back .	1	1
1	so why the low rating ?	1	1
1	i walked to find dinner .	1	1
1	they also rushed me during my final fitting .	1	1
1	did not have enough staff in kitchen and never bothered to provide updates .	1	1
1	the worst of it is the damage caused by being over processed .	1	1
1	took money out of my account for late fees .	1	1
1	the specials and menu prices are apparently wrong .	1	1
1	very unappetizing and i was unable to continue eating .	1	1
1	do n't go here unless you 've got _num_ hours to kill .	1	1
1	this time , the staff were new , loud and mean .	1	1
1	i pointed out the mistake and she apologized and took it back .	1	1
1	nope ... no where to be found on the menu .	1	1
1	initially , they ended up giving me a $ _num_ credit .	1	1
1	we normally delivery at work 2-3 or _num_ times a week .	1	1
1	poor job .	1	1
1	cold food ?	1	1
1	it 's been a tremendous ordeal to get it fixed .	1	1
1	the thick white bread was dry and boring ; too crusty .	1	1
1	for being a hilton i was n't too impressed !	1	1
1	service was not good .	1	1
1	also the restaurant is not really clean either .	1	1
1	the bathroom was awful , bedding lumpy and ancient , and the lighting poor .	1	1
1	i only gave them _num_ star because _num_ was n't an option .	1	1
1	got _num_ bites for one night .	1	1
1	i you want chinese go to how lee , or china palace .	1	1
1	also , i had ordered a fried pickle appetizer .	1	1
1	they did have other types of dogs but they were more expensive .	1	1
1	once again , the nurse 's attitude was inexcusable .	1	1
1	this was after waiting 20+ minutes at the register with cash in hand .	1	1
1	thankfully , our later stops were much better .	1	1
1	all the pasta for our party was undercooked ; there were _num_ of us .	1	1
1	i only returned because i was getting my dog groomed at the nearby petco .	1	1
1	never coming back again , it was such a waste of money !	1	1
1	first time in pittsburgh on biz and staying in the waterfront district .	1	1
1	been here twice ; both times it was an awful experience .	1	1
1	when she came back and had nothing i gave up .	1	1
1	but we will not stand to be ripped off by you .	1	1
1	it all comes down to the crust -- i threw it out .	1	1
1	worst customer service ever !	1	1
1	that said ... for _num_ people , my lunch tab came to $ _num_ .	1	1
1	do not go there , they have no customer service !	1	1
1	it was n't pan fried either .	1	1
1	i do n't have a nicer room that i can move you to .	1	1
1	little did i know , that race was starting in five minutes !	1	1
1	ugly .	1	1
1	small station .	1	1
1	save your $ _num_ and skip this place .	1	1
1	not a table in the bar area had been cleaned in that period .	1	1
1	it 's bizarre .	1	1
1	just gon na stand here and get looked over for a little while longer .	1	1
1	i chose a sugar cookie and mexican cookie .	1	1
1	every time we are seated in the dining area it 's a bad experience .	1	1
1	the nurse was very short with me .	1	1
1	i would not recommend anyone to take their pet to this facility .	1	1
1	we wo n't be ordering from here again .	1	1
1	note to self to avoid this airport at all costs .	1	1
1	do n't waste your time or money .	1	1
1	slow service and response .	1	1
1	worst chinese food i 've had in a while .	1	1
1	overpriced beer and overpriced , bad food .	1	1
1	anyway , we had to purchase more tickets at the door .	1	1
1	the restaurant was fairly busy with lots of customers chatting at their tables .	1	1
1	two and a half stars , neither a-ok nor real bad .	1	1
1	i 'll buy my product there from now on .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	he put the tv in my truck turned around and walked away .	1	1
1	the place was out of control .	1	1
1	urban spoon rated _num_ % favorite .	1	1
1	furthermore , i have ordered the shrimp with garlic sauce .	1	1
1	cold , and not exactly what i had ordered !	1	1
1	terrible service !	1	1
1	the meat itself was dry - anyone can get greasy burgers .	1	1
1	the half order of ribs looked like a full rack .	1	1
1	texture and temperature of the fish scared me .	1	1
1	next stop , the better business bureau .	1	1
1	_num_ of us came here for dinner and ordered burgers and drinks .	1	1
1	the seafood was a little undercooked and everything was dripping in butter .	1	1
1	hate the atmosphere , so dark during the day .	1	1
1	i was on break i did not have time to go back that day .	1	1
1	at one point , they even asked me not to use the shower .	1	1
1	it 's ridiculous .	1	1
1	the worst restaurant ever !	1	1
1	the service was very poor .	1	1
1	our food came to us cold and unimpressive at that .	1	1
1	it was late at night near closing , only thing i could find open .	1	1
1	even my little children were totally unimpressed .	1	1
1	old couch with fake leather peeling off of it !	1	1
1	_num_ minutes later we were sat .	1	1
1	just awful in every sense of the way .	1	1
1	this place does not accept credit cards in the year _num_ .	1	1
1	saying that this dinner was awful is an understatement .	1	1
1	why did n't i go with them first ?	1	1
1	it costs $ _num_ for a manicure and $ _num_ for a pedicure .	1	1
1	finally this place was stale like the bread !	1	1
1	( which i did ) i waited for _num_ mins before the bus arrived .	1	1
1	there probably wo n't be a wait !	1	1
1	on average , _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	both restrooms and the drinking fountain were out of order .	1	1
1	reviewers , we will be looking for another provider for these services .	1	1
1	there are a couple nicer options nearby that probably do n't cost much more .	1	1
1	another mistake was sitting outside when they are trying to bring people in .	1	1
1	the pizza was cut all messed up as well .	1	1
1	come now , i barely drink alcohol .	1	1
1	they get two for the great service but everything else was not so good .	1	1
1	the salad 's ginger dressing was awful and watery .	1	1
1	the bartender never came back to me to take my drink order .	1	1
1	there were tiny pieces of what looked like artificial crab .	1	1
1	this is an average chinese buffet .	1	1
1	$ _num_ for gnocchi ?	1	1
1	i kept bringing the _num_ month old outside to walk around .	1	1
1	you no longer deserve my business .	1	1
1	restaurant had a horrible cleaned my smell as well .	1	1
1	no microwave in room .	1	1
1	the bathrooms were atrocious .	1	1
1	it smelled and tasted awful .	1	1
1	too bad .	1	1
1	not nice ... .	1	1
1	_num_ ) the food was lackluster .	1	1
1	the hotel is starting to look warn and needs investment .	1	1
1	completely unacceptable and disgusting to sell such expired food to your customers .	1	1
1	first , we were disappointed by how many places were closed on a sunday .	1	1
1	this is not what you promised to sell me .	1	1
1	is n't that what baked ziti is ?	1	1
1	the karaoke had a very limited selection .	1	1
1	sadly , this was not the case .	1	1
1	so , i went with a staple dish , vegetable lo mein .	1	1
1	are you kidding me ?	1	1
1	this place was really gross .	1	1
1	i 've only been here once , so i would n't know .	1	1
1	did get groom or however they did not give the shot yet .	1	1
1	bad decision .	1	1
1	what is really bad is the service .	1	1
1	first , i 'll walk you through my experience .	1	1
1	that 's is bad business !	1	1
1	fries with burger were luke warm .	1	1
1	the food was very basic and a little greasy .	1	1
1	my husband gave me a gift certificate for this salon .	1	1
1	the last person i 'll point out is , i think , larry .	1	1
1	that 's about where the positives stop .	1	1
1	so i do n't need to tell you how nasty that was .	1	1
1	cheese curds , i 've had better .	1	1
1	i do not see myself returning .	1	1
1	communication is horrible !	1	1
1	the _num_ starts are just because the broccoli looks fresh .	1	1
1	the food is not incredible and the service is always mediocre at best .	1	1
1	i 'm not sure they were .	1	1
1	if i could give this place _num_ stars , i would .	1	1
1	we have not been back .	1	1
1	the aisles feel more narrow than they should be for a store this size .	1	1
1	needless to say i refused to pay for them .	1	1
1	i will not return to new china .	1	1
1	did i mention the cake was dry ?	1	1
1	i can easily say this is the worst indian food i have ever eaten .	1	1
1	hello new owners ; this is a recipe for disaster .	1	1
1	do not do business with these people .	1	1
1	i have n't received my piece yet and its been about _num_ days .	1	1
1	even burger king does n't microwave their breakfast !	1	1
1	i never went back thanks to the attitude of the other members .	1	1
1	never use this place .	1	1
1	man , the rent has to be so cheap !	1	1
1	they 're actually worse than some large corporate stores in these areas .	1	1
1	went here with a gift card from the restaurant week photo competition .	1	1
1	the sesame chicken was terrible .	1	1
1	it was n't edible .	1	1
1	sat outside for _num_ min with no service .	1	1
1	no sorry or who told you this .	1	1
1	the moo shu pork was forgettable .	1	1
1	third terrible .	1	1
1	this is a terrible shelter .	1	1
1	the woman who answered the phone said yes to both so i rushed over .	1	1
1	delivery was fine but the food was terrible .	1	1
1	the ice cream technician could only take one order at a time .	1	1
1	the place smells of old towels and the bathrooms are horrible .	1	1
1	ca n't win 'em all , right ?	1	1
1	once seated , i practically had to beg for a wine list .	1	1
1	it tasted like charcoal .	1	1
1	they completely ignored us so we got up and left .	1	1
1	of shrimp and _num_ scallops with very little salad greens for alot of money .	1	1
1	we waited a long time for our courses and forever for our check .	1	1
1	the cauliflower was good but there spinach all i tasted was vinegar .	1	1
1	it has cheese fries added to it .	1	1
1	secondly , the kitchen is one of the worst in the entire company .	1	1
1	service was terrible .	1	1
1	horrible , horrible , horrible .	1	1
1	the real shame is that they obviously changed the fried chicken recipe .	1	1
1	if i could give signature desserts _num_ stars , i would .	1	1
1	needless to say , we were unable to take advantage of any specials .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	well , they could n't help me with that either .	1	1
1	the food is seriously lacking .	1	1
1	also , i was surprised by the limited number of seafood options .	1	1
1	instead of caramelized onions , they added raw onions .	1	1
1	nothing has changed .	1	1
1	i can not believe my experience with this hotel .	1	1
1	this was explained to us before we ordered .	1	1
1	nothing but flavorless , americanized chinese food .	1	1
1	lastly , i 've had some really poor customer service experiences at this location .	1	1
1	the meat was n't special .	1	1
1	this is by far the absolute worst furniture experience i have encountered .	1	1
1	as promised , they were ready monday after 5pm .	1	1
1	provolone sticks arrived undercooked , cheese was fully solid , they tasted okay .	1	1
1	if they did n't have half price groupons , i would never eat here .	1	1
1	but does n't nutella tastes like peanut butter to you ?	1	1
1	tried their philly cheese steak .	1	1
1	first of all , house chianti tasted like vinegar .	1	1
1	i was disappointed the waitress did n't say anything either .	1	1
1	delicate product was not shipped with appropriate packaging .	1	1
1	no reason to go to this place , spend your money elsewhere .	1	1
1	tried thin man , closed .	1	1
1	she not only lost out on a past customer .	1	1
1	i feel bad for the lady that works the paint counter .	1	1
1	when i arrived , i was seated quickly and greeted by a stylist .	1	1
1	_num_ couples ahead of me and my wife ... wait time is 10-15 minutes .	1	1
1	also lot _num_ had some funky smells throughout the time that we were there .	1	1
1	so she asked for a little more from the server .	1	1
1	this also ruins my plan of getting another cat in the future .	1	1
1	i did n't see any shrimp , not even mini shrimp .	1	1
1	i just have to wonder why lidia would create a menu like this .	1	1
1	the flavor is ok but why is the dog so skinny ?	1	1
1	the guy ( tom ) , acknowledged everything i was saying .	1	1
1	my house is under 1,000 sf .	1	1
1	no more .	1	1
1	sheets looked old .	1	1
1	too many fries on the sandwich .	1	1
1	apparently it was a list of people that needed to be seated .	1	1
1	the hummus is a little bland .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	the service is snotty and slow .	1	1
1	they still use an antique register at the front check out counter .	1	1
1	i would never recommend living here .	1	1
1	strange looking , and bad tasting .	1	1
1	hence why i needed the coffee .	1	1
1	everything was pretty picked over , which kinda sucked .	1	1
1	i 'm sick and disgusted with you !	1	1
1	grocery stores are always open .	1	1
1	he said that he could not take it and referred me to the manager .	1	1
1	there are far too many better pizza places to indulge in .	1	1
1	i waited _num_ mins in the lobby .	1	1
1	instead she could of said ok would you like something else instead .	1	1
1	there was no apology given or really any concern about customer service .	1	1
1	thought the staff was incredibly rude .	1	1
1	rice is a little plain but i just add some soy sauce .	1	1
1	not coming back anymore after i find another band to replace this band .	1	1
1	i went into dean of shadyside salon to get my hair colored .	1	1
1	$ _num_ for anything !	1	1
1	much closer to bland than anything .	1	1
1	do n't waste your time .	1	1
1	the food left a lot to be desired .	1	1
1	the company is run by morons .	1	1
1	awful place , to bad i was looking forward .	1	1
1	it stayed there for about _num_ minutes before i was called to the counter .	1	1
1	long term parking at clt is dreadful .	1	1
1	continuing on , check out was a nightmare !	1	1
1	go in summer or no point in going .	1	1
1	sorry i bothered you from sitting on your *** .	1	1
1	if you have any alternative , though , i would avoid this place .	1	1
1	no way coming back other than drinks in the summer .	1	1
1	i do n't understand why this place think 's it has famous corned beef .	1	1
1	the dinner ( some kind of fish ) was salty .	1	1
1	now i am forced to put in another quarter to finish my load .	1	1
1	no taste .	1	1
1	terrible wait times at night .	1	1
1	that displeased me more than the disappointing food .	1	1
1	will not be back there -- rude hostess !	1	1
1	i am _num_ and i was probably youngest patron .	1	1
1	i ordered a steak and cheese hoagie and it arrived in a burnt bun .	1	1
1	that was $ _num_ wasted .	1	1
1	waste of time and money .	1	1
1	this place needs renovation and cleaned up desperately .	1	1
1	i was highly disappointed in the service , and i only ordered take out .	1	1
1	i 'm confused why anyone would choose to go here .	1	1
1	for the most part , i 've had ok experiences with the food selections .	1	1
1	managed very poorly .	1	1
1	the hostess that had little to nothing to say prior or during our seating ?	1	1
1	nothing to write home about .	1	1
1	she just looked through the lost & found list without putting me on hold .	1	1
1	the service was annoying .	1	1
1	no redeeming qualities here .	1	1
1	boring and expensive .	1	1
1	terrible customer service will never book with them again .	1	1
1	nothing to write home about .	1	1
1	we had to send the potatoes back because they were cold .	1	1
1	the hummus was okay , and our main plate seemed to be microwaved .	1	1
1	it would take less than _num_ day of their time .	1	1
1	the food is mediocre at best .	1	1
1	actually , there are not `` two sizes '' of `` one scoop '' .	1	1
1	worst experience of my life .	1	1
1	they kept the beer and wine flowing at our table at every visit .	1	1
1	decor looks like you have time traveled to _num_ .	1	1
1	it 's horrible .	1	1
1	service was great , however , the food was mediocre .	1	1
1	this is not unusual for wally world these days .	1	1
1	wrong !	1	1
1	it does n't matter how hard i slam this place .	1	1
1	we were seated and our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable .	1	1
1	i just do n't know how a business in _num_ can operate this way .	1	1
1	we finished our dumplings .	1	1
1	there is no wifi and only two outlets .	1	1
1	just called to get information for my son 's birthday cake .	1	1
1	my appointment was at _num_ .	1	1
1	there is no valet .	1	1
1	it was neither busy nor a late hour for lunch .	1	1
1	oh , i forgot , the piss is also really expensive .	1	1
1	it made my whole experience disappointing .	1	1
1	the kicker , the place was n't busy , not in the least bit .	1	1
1	the wedding soup was less than fair .	1	1
1	terribly ran !	1	1
1	get your act together .	1	1
1	disappointed , big time .	1	1
1	i was there on a weeknight , for over _num_ hours .	1	1
1	this place is very below average .	1	1
1	on the 3rd floor , with no elevator in sight .	1	1
1	the whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth .	1	1
1	when i picked up the sandwich grease poured from it .	1	1
1	it took _num_ minutes for my plate to come out .	1	1
1	worst service and seating ever !	1	1
1	after _num_ minutes without getting closer to the register , i gave up .	1	1
1	third problem : they gave us no inspection paperwork .	1	1
1	_num_ hours before close and i asked for the grilled chicken bites .	1	1
1	something as simple as this still has not happened .	1	1
1	it was a little runny and the dip to chips ratio was disappointing .	1	1
1	the restaurant is located in a tired part of town .	1	1
1	no steak knife , no mashed potatoes , no asparagus as ordered .	1	1
1	not a _num_ % credit .	1	1
1	the crab rangoons were simply not crab rangoons .	1	1
1	may not ever go back .	1	1
1	do not go to this location .	1	1
1	this is the worst company as far as billing & customer service are concerned .	1	1
1	do n't waste your time and money here .	1	1
1	that , to me , says a lot about their skill level .	1	1
1	i felt really unwelcome the entire time i was in the store .	1	1
1	$ _num_ for antibiotics that you can buy at harris teeter for $ _num_ .	1	1
1	the `` move over '' sign is utterly ridiculous .	1	1
1	the biggest disappointment was the veal chop .	1	1
1	this is ridiculous .	1	1
1	this time was not so good .	1	1
1	self checkout is the only option and is a joke .	1	1
1	not recommend .	1	1
1	this giant eagle maybe the worst supermarket i 've ever been to .	1	1
1	needs more books and homeless people .	1	1
1	_num_ these guys can never seem to cook their fries properly .	1	1
1	very bad customer service , extremely slow .	1	1
1	generally a dirty airport ( delta terminal ) .	1	1
1	waited _num_ minutes for two glasses of wine .	1	1
1	i 'll never return again .	1	1
1	not cool .	1	1
1	it was a basic salad , no big deal .	1	1
1	egg rolls , wonton soup were not good .	1	1
1	imo this was very stupid & we 'll not be using them again .	1	1
1	no fish .	1	1
1	sure , i wrote that down and remembered it _num_ months later .	1	1
1	this is the 2nd time visiting and 2nd time being disappointed .	1	1
1	breakfast was n't anything to look forward to .	1	1
1	after about _num_ minutes she realized she was entering it incorrectly .	1	1
1	wrong .	1	1
1	horrible experience .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	needless to say we did not return to redeem it .	1	1
1	i keep forgetting how not good this location is .	1	1
1	the bartenders had no desire to serve `` us '' .	1	1
1	if you care about your natural nails , stay away from this place .	1	1
1	it 's not worth it .	1	1
1	my second room : same line , 3rd floor , also accessible .	1	1
1	the only good thing about the experience was the beer selection .	1	1
1	no thanks .	1	1
1	contact lenses over-priced .	1	1
1	has it come to reviewing fast food joints ?	1	1
1	and while you 're eating too ... it 's so disgusting .	1	1
1	everybody has bad days , they should not be this bad ... .	1	1
1	i would have been furious if i paid $ _num_ for tasteless pasta .	1	1
1	this was all during my favorite song which really made me mad .	1	1
1	food is only fair - burger was pretty flavorless and dry .	1	1
1	it also felt like i was eating a bowl of lard .	1	1
1	( but they have still not done this _num_ weeks later ) .	1	1
1	not impressed .	1	1
1	the service is terrible !	1	1
1	he can not get the shape right to save his life .	1	1
1	i would like to say that i am only disappointed by what 's happened .	1	1
1	did they bite off more than they can chew ?	1	1
1	sad , very , very sad .	1	1
1	first of all the sandwich was on sliced bread ( lame ) !	1	1
1	the carpet was dirty and the room was extremely dusty .	1	1
1	and each time i 've gone , my haircut has been ... .	1	1
1	however , neither were great .	1	1
1	walked in and smelled the musty smell that other yelpers described .	1	1
1	it was n't very crowded , so we were seated right away .	1	1
1	now , a week later , i have lost all patience .	1	1
1	i do n't blame it on the servers but whoever manages the place .	1	1
1	it does n't work .	1	1
1	looked past that and this week had terrible pain in my foot .	1	1
1	that 's right , my burrito had no flavor .	1	1
1	this place is horrible .	1	1
1	you also get lip from the owner if you want to pay credit .	1	1
1	it was a side salad with a handful of grilled veggies on top .	1	1
1	in short , avoid this place !	1	1
1	the cookie was terrible !	1	1
1	i found it online for just over $ _num_ and i replaced it myself .	1	1
1	it tasted like wasabi , but why the hell was it brown ?	1	1
1	tables were not very clean .	1	1
1	i gave him a _num_ % tip .	1	1
1	not a spot of pink to be found .	1	1
1	i also wore my shoes in the shower because of how unsanitary it was !	1	1
1	even the door man commented on how rude the bartenders were .	1	1
1	too many other choices in charlotte to come back here .	1	1
1	my big issue is that the employees stand directly outside and smoke .	1	1
1	so i had to eat my sides cold .	1	1
1	will not go back there , ever !	1	1
1	they offered me nothing .	1	1
1	what i received reminded me of mrs grass soup .	1	1
1	what they are doing is not right and needs to stop immediately .	1	1
1	when they do deliver , it always takes longer than the estimated time .	1	1
1	over-priced , slow , very dirty , and an overall sketchy vibe .	1	1
1	_num_ hour and _num_ mins is ridiculously long to wait !	1	1
1	i was too drunk and full of pita donuts to eat my dinner .	1	1
1	unfortunately the atmosphere did n't make up for the sub par food .	1	1
1	anyone could just walk right up to that empty pool and fall in .	1	1
1	really need to put some money into this place .	1	1
1	never ever again will we return here .	1	1
1	it was loud , but expected that on a friday night .	1	1
1	i had the linguine carbonara and it was more like scrambled eggs and noodles .	1	1
1	still very slow service at drive through .	1	1
1	the meat was so tough , i gave up after a few pieces .	1	1
1	surprisingly , none of it was really that good .	1	1
1	eyebrow waxing is significantly overpriced at $ _num_ .	1	1
1	i went back again for half off appetizers , and was horribly disappointed .	1	1
1	to make it worse , they are supposed to open at _num_ .	1	1
1	do n't waste your money .	1	1
1	sadly , dinner tuesday evening on my most recent trip was a disappointment .	1	1
1	and still disappointed .	1	1
1	staff definitely are really rude .	1	1
1	this time , it was ridiculous .	1	1
1	of course , the order came out quickly , and wrong .	1	1
1	food was overpriced and less than average .	1	1
1	worst meal we 've ever had .	1	1
1	again no salt or seasoning .	1	1
1	!	1	1
1	they did not fix the building by the way .	1	1
1	i might return for drinks but only drinks .	1	1
1	nothing was comped and no manager was available .	1	1
1	worst mother 's day experience ever .	1	1
1	Negative	1	1
1	for anyone who uses self checkout at this store do not forget your bags !	1	1
1	i was charged $ _num_ for a full tank and service .	1	1
1	since wings are supposed to be their thing this is pretty unacceptable .	1	1
1	fried green tomatoes were good .	1	1
1	do not use this dry cleaner .	1	1
1	my meal was way over cooked .	1	1
1	i 've chosen never to eat here again due to the staff .	1	1
1	she ended up paying $ _num_ .	1	1
1	then , turns around and walks off .	1	1
1	however , from the get go , our host was absolutely terrible .	1	1
1	sorry wo n't be back !	1	1
1	my feet were still rough .	1	1
1	incredibly unfriendly staff , completely clueless consultant .	1	1
1	the hype surrounding this place will probably lead to your great disappointment .	1	1
1	do not recommend .	1	1
1	if i could give this restaurant a zero , i would .	1	1
1	i should have probably ordered from the diet menu .	1	1
1	i 'm not asking too much .	1	1
1	finally , overall the prices were way too high .	1	1
1	oh , pat buses , why ca n't i quit you ?	1	1
1	i proceeded to say , '' are you laughing at me ? ''	1	1
1	the first time , i thought maybe i just got a bad batch .	1	1
1	did they think they could get away with it and we would n't notice ?	1	1
1	my gut just tells me not to trust e 'n ps .	1	1
1	i do not get the hype behind this place .	1	1
1	it was not edible .	1	1
1	this place is disgusting .	1	1
1	and it was cold - did n't even take my winter coat off .	1	1
1	they do not take pride in their work .	1	1
1	what a terrible customer service !	1	1
1	wo n't be back .	1	1
1	the waitresses have bad attitudes and rush you when ordering .	1	1
1	this place is empty ... .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	she never introduced herself or spoke to me the whole time .	1	1
1	i have one shoe which the sole is falling off .	1	1
1	needless to say i was disappointed again !	1	1
1	the waitress was n't rude , but she just was n't there .	1	1
1	if i was n't vegan , i 'd eat the dish .	1	1
1	worst chinese food ever !	1	1
1	no flavor .	1	1
1	at the time , it was the premier cigar shop in the pittsburgh area .	1	1
1	poor service , awful attitudes and sub-par food .	1	1
1	thankfully they give it to me without further lip .	1	1
1	this stuff tasted like really cheap , bad , ranch dressing .	1	1
1	this was the worst gel manicure experience i 've had .	1	1
1	needless to say , she would n't leave us alone .	1	1
1	the rice was too dry , and there was barely any flavor .	1	1
1	it was just ordinary .	1	1
1	mashed potatoes are not made from real potatoes .	1	1
1	sarcastic bartender and place half empty .	1	1
1	lazy and slow as ever !	1	1
1	i even questioned it because i said it did n't look right .	1	1
1	by this time , i was through with this place .	1	1
1	the menu is blah and the food is also .	1	1
1	and then i just got mad .	1	1
1	for $ _num_ , they ca n't find i potato ?	1	1
1	whatever the case , they have cold guinness .	1	1
1	things went from okay to a little worse to absolutely horrible .	1	1
1	their service is terrible .	1	1
1	and mind , i ate two of my party 's portion on noodles .	1	1
1	when i told them that , they just lied and said they did .	1	1
1	how disgusting .	1	1
1	there was only _num_ bartender working so the service was a little slow .	1	1
1	i am going to give up on lowes .	1	1
1	decor is tasteless and old .	1	1
1	usually only one cashier is working and they are slow .	1	1
1	a simple yes or no would have been nice .	1	1
1	if any of the employees would smile i would die from shock .	1	1
1	so if you 're a horse you wo n't go thirsty .	1	1
1	the salad was good , the ribs were as tough as leather .	1	1
1	food was very bland and watery .	1	1
1	it was n't the cut .	1	1
1	stay away from them like the plague if possible .	1	1
1	food tasted ok and was brought out really quick , hence the _num_ stars .	1	1
1	i showed him my coupon , and asked him if he accepted them .	1	1
1	i had a bad experience at penn automotive .	1	1
1	needless to say some people do n't think outside the box .	1	1
1	i was sadly mistaken .	1	1
1	i mean , there was oil dripping out of the inside .	1	1
1	it 's disgusting .	1	1
1	the really really low point of the meal was the desert .	1	1
1	yes bar - no one under _num_ allowed .	1	1
1	i should have looked or felt it before i left the store .	1	1
1	bored , bored , bored , bored , bored .	1	1
1	essentially three pieces of toast with various toppings .	1	1
1	but then i got my chicken lemongrass soup .	1	1
1	the lighting was nonexistent , we were basically eating in the dark .	1	1
1	i 've been on hold for _num_ minutes so far .	1	1
1	disappointed but not giving up , we ordered one of each and proceeded .	1	1
1	the fish was old and cold and fries were a very soft .	1	1
1	they have an assortment of beer and wine .	1	1
1	not even the shuttle goes anywhere useful .	1	1
1	everything tasted like nothing .	1	1
1	i would not recommend them .	1	1
1	tonight was horrible !	1	1
1	worst italian food ever !	1	1
1	all the doctor could say was `` hmmm , that 's really weird '' .	1	1
1	as we get our 2nd batch of sushi our soup was still not ready .	1	1
1	it 's even more disappointing when the restaurant refuses to correct the order .	1	1
1	not a fan of the service .	1	1
1	so , i decided to sit outside as i had already ordered my food .	1	1
1	right at _num_ , glasses were given out to a few tables around us .	1	1
1	horrible !	1	1
1	that 's such an easy fix , it just shows they do n't care .	1	1
1	i ate it but will definitely not go there again !	1	1
1	the worst dental office i ever been .	1	1
1	furthermore , no one has returned any of my messages ... .	1	1
1	unfortunately , mert 's is a failure to the soul food world .	1	1
1	terrible value .	1	1
1	i wo n't go here ever again because of the poor service .	1	1
1	my fiance and i went to cajun queen one night as a date night .	1	1
1	anyway , i stood in line behind one other person to order my breakfast .	1	1
1	i had the pizza and it was mediocre at best .	1	1
1	so i drove _num_ hours there on a weekend to renew .	1	1
1	the fries were soggy and soft , fish mediocre .	1	1
1	my husband was so confused with his sandwich .	1	1
1	tonight , however , was just awful .	1	1
1	i did n't see many family during our stay !	1	1
1	the worst pizza hut ever .	1	1
1	-they did not install tires correctly .	1	1
1	inside is just average quality , equally average priced produce .	1	1
1	to get home so that i could write it down .	1	1
1	he said they 're making improvements and that i should try it again .	1	1
1	was trying to find a rating lower than _num_ star but could n't .	1	1
1	the collard greens were insanely salty .	1	1
1	i really do n't see the hype .	1	1
1	she apparently had no time to take a wet cloth the the tables .	1	1
1	better than nothing , i suppose .	1	1
1	i 'm sorry but that is a personal pet peeve .	1	1
1	both the pizza and the breadsticks are not the quality i used to .	1	1
1	i wish i could give a minus _num_ .	1	1
1	the place had a great location but otherwise it 's a waste .	1	1
1	the steak was rough and bad .	1	1
1	sorry , i grew up in pgh .	1	1
1	do yourself a favor and go to quail dry cleaners next door .	1	1
1	worst .	1	1
1	that would mostly considered as cheap customers .	1	1
1	i asked for a pen , not a kidney .	1	1
1	small flies flying around restaurant .	1	1
1	the service was lacking , the check was dropped off right after the food .	1	1
1	where i am at , really there is no delivery but these guys did .	1	1
1	head next door to sing sing for drinks , though .	1	1
1	extremely inattentive , uninterested and not warm .	1	1
1	no tofu , no seasoning or sauce .	1	1
1	not impressed .	1	1
1	my wife 's veggie sandwich was very plain .	1	1
1	the horrible location ?	1	1
1	almost three days later , i had n't heard back from them .	1	1
1	could not understand what the foreign cashier was saying , made placing near impossible .	1	1
1	it is just disgusting .	1	1
1	it is a waste of time and money .	1	1
1	everything else was of unremarkable to poor quality .	1	1
1	mac & cheese : so , so .	1	1
1	i had to spit the oyster out in a napkin .	1	1
1	i order an ice tea , it was horrible !	1	1
1	for southern home cooking , this was an insult .	1	1
1	and service is piss poor and understaffed .	1	1
1	presentation was so so and the taste of the food was mediocre .	1	1
1	beer selection is better in my house .	1	1
1	the lady that did my nails was so rude .	1	1
1	they 're also very expensive .	1	1
1	entire place smells like wet dog .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	there are many dining and drinking options , and cool rocking chairs .	1	1
1	the bill was $ _num_ so it is pricey .	1	1
1	i will not be back .	1	1
1	complete waste of life .	1	1
1	the waitress even apologized for her lack of attention .	1	1
1	while it was ok , it was n't great .	1	1
1	but my praise begins and ends there .	1	1
1	i will never spend money here again !	1	1
1	- this really was the standout .	1	1
1	services between spas are typically the same .	1	1
1	how rude !	1	1
1	seems management does n't care either ... .	1	1
1	i did enjoy the bbq shrimp app but the entrees were miserable .	1	1
1	fishy smell .	1	1
1	but this was not what i had in mind .	1	1
1	do n't think i 'll be coming back .	1	1
1	he cried constantly when i left his sight .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	only _num_ stars .	1	1
1	we walked out and still nobody noticed .	1	1
1	i 'm too scared to shop there after dark .	1	1
1	i told the server that the meat was dry , overcooked and old tasting .	1	1
1	i 'm not a big fan of this airport .	1	1
1	also did n't seem very nice .	1	1
1	the calamari appetizer was good , but not worth $ _num_ .	1	1
1	my wife had the salmon which was better than the filet but nothing exciting .	1	1
1	went for the first and last time tonight .	1	1
1	it 's miserable . ''	1	1
1	there is no reason they ca n't be cleaned .	1	1
1	i had to get up and find my waitress myself .	1	1
1	it 's like breakfast at most any other diner .	1	1
1	the health code rating has also fallen from a _num_ to a _num_ .	1	1
1	i see the server standing right there with no response .	1	1
1	we dined rather early , so there was no wait .	1	1
1	so disappointed with this place .	1	1
1	this place is n't worth going to an atm for .	1	1
1	velvet corn and chicken soup was tasty but needed lots of pepper .	1	1
1	i 'm not holding up a line .	1	1
1	penne was mediocre at best .	1	1
1	i 'm not even sure where to start .	1	1
1	this store sucks beyond belief !	1	1
1	for a taco bell , this one is horrible .	1	1
1	i am sad to report that this too was tasteless .	1	1
1	suggest going elsewhere unless you have plenty of time to waste .	1	1
1	i had the pasta trio .	1	1
1	i do not recommend this restaurant .	1	1
1	however , we will not be back .	1	1
1	the kitchen is in plain view of the customers which is nice .	1	1
1	_num_ minutes later my date had finished his meal and my fries were gone .	1	1
1	salmon was so dry it was difficult to cut much less eat .	1	1
1	this place is below average when it comes to service & pizza 's .	1	1
1	bad all the way around .	1	1
1	that being said , this place was not good .	1	1
1	the food is poor .	1	1
1	but it left a bad taste in my mouth .	1	1
1	avoid at all costs ... .	1	1
1	he also went on to give me the fastest haircut i 've ever had .	1	1
1	unacceptable .	1	1
1	the prime rib was overcooked and dry .	1	1
1	on my first the front desk persons were slow , unfriendly and grumpy .	1	1
1	it tasted nothing like pork , or meat for that matter .	1	1
1	no manager on duty for the busy morning rush .	1	1
1	maybe it 's just chinese places that stop serving ?	1	1
1	do n't waste your money !	1	1
1	... another one bites the dust !	1	1
1	my salad was missing _num_ items that were supposed to be on the salad .	1	1
1	this is a terrible airport .	1	1
1	sadly , they just are n't .	1	1
1	the rest of us gave up and left .	1	1
1	the waitress then proceeded to say the mussels were ready .	1	1
1	please save your money and visit another store or company .	1	1
1	however , every times i drive thru pittsburgh , i always stopped here .	1	1
1	everything was bland , nothing had seasoning , not even basic salt .	1	1
1	and that its all the owners fault about the price .	1	1
1	worst combination of southern efficiency and northern charm .	1	1
1	- lamb kabobs - undercooked and falling apart .	1	1
1	i do n't know , maybe we came on an off night .	1	1
1	the chicken wings tasted like fake butter and rubber .	1	1
1	food was bad .	1	1
1	dirty plates were sitting in our table for a long time .	1	1
1	disappointed .	1	1
1	they also did away with the _num_ cent wing night .	1	1
1	but do n't expect that feeling here .	1	1
1	what a disappointment .	1	1
1	bad food , horrible service .	1	1
1	when i got home they did n't give me my kids meals .	1	1
1	pop and they were down the hatch !	1	1
1	did they use the tea pot as an ash tray ?	1	1
1	hummus is ridiculously expensive .	1	1
1	they asked if i was sure i only moved in five days earlier .	1	1
1	it smelled like burnt fish when we walked in the door .	1	1
1	it 's ... just ... not that good .	1	1
1	salsa was just okay .	1	1
1	our order was lost from the waitress to the kitchen .	1	1
1	they ended up making a new one and the wait was over _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	unless you sit at the bar , the service is poor .	1	1
1	would n't go back .	1	1
1	hence , i am now here , writing this review .	1	1
1	i do n't understand the hype for this place .	1	1
1	rude .	1	1
1	in fact , all of the food is becoming gross .	1	1
1	was not busy but waitress was hard to find .	1	1
1	too expensive .	1	1
1	well , this place manages to be worse than it .	1	1
1	i order the jack daniel 's chicken and shrimp with just fries .	1	1
1	the service was absolutely horrible .	1	1
1	the parlor looked nothing like the pictures on this website .	1	1
1	this restaurant is going downhill .	1	1
1	but this was quickly corrected .	1	1
1	we will not be back .	1	1
1	there is nothing to set this place apart from , ugh , walmart .	1	1
1	saturday was my first time back and i was dissapointed in the changes .	1	1
1	as for the atmosphere , not a big deal for me .	1	1
1	nothing special .	1	1
1	i just feel like i 've had much better pizza elsewhere around town .	1	1
1	no complaints there .	1	1
1	hand me my order and cash me out ! )	1	1
1	the menu was very very small .	1	1
1	the front staff was rude , and the wait was too long .	1	1
1	i do n't recommend this restaurant to anyone .	1	1
1	unfortunately , we were unable to drink this bottle of wine .	1	1
1	there 's nothing really wrong with it .	1	1
1	the food was horrible !	1	1
1	wish i could give less than _num_ star .	1	1
1	those expectations kind of fell flat .	1	1
1	the food , on the other hand , is not good .	1	1
1	nothing to write home about and pretty expensive .	1	1
1	my drink was never refilled .	1	1
1	i have not a single good thing to say about this restaurant .	1	1
1	when it came down to orders and service though , sadly was disappointed .	1	1
1	apparently my empty glass was n't enough of a visual cue .	1	1
1	do n't waste your time or money .	1	1
1	not to mention half the moving walkways were not working .	1	1
1	i 'll utilize another tour company during my next charlotte visit .	1	1
1	poor follow up .	1	1
1	we asked ... should we get out own menus ?	1	1
1	me `` okay ... i guess ? ''	1	1
1	i really ca n't imagine what could be making it so slow here .	1	1
1	the prices are cheap , but it 's not worth it .	1	1
1	if you hate the public , you should n't work with them .	1	1
1	it was much better than the spicy pasta .	1	1
1	not so much at uptown charlotte .	1	1
1	then someone came over and said hi .	1	1
1	however , as a guest , i would not go back .	1	1
1	i 'm sad because this was my favorite thai restaurant .	1	1
1	never once quality checked us .	1	1
1	it is a cash only establishment and the staff was very rude .	1	1
1	went with a group of about _num_ - _num_ people on a thursday night .	1	1
1	and never refilled our empty water glasses .	1	1
1	but unfortunately they had already sold out of the special .	1	1
1	very crowded , not a problem .	1	1
1	horrible .	1	1
1	my boyfriend 's dinner was a real disappointment , however .	1	1
1	well there must have been a `` bank error `` they said .	1	1
1	i do n't remember her name which is usually not a good sign .	1	1
1	the beans were beans , nothing special .	1	1
1	it tasted worse than it looked ( if that was possible ) .	1	1
1	i would give _num_ stars if i could .	1	1
1	will probably not go back except perhaps to try the pizza .	1	1
1	my overall opinion is that the service was terrible and the food was overpriced .	1	1
1	finally , someone wandered in from the back and rang up our items .	1	1
1	the wonton soup was watery , and the wontons were inedible .	1	1
1	i 've never lucked out here .	1	1
1	sure enough the poached eggs were hard boiled .	1	1
1	wrong .	1	1
1	yes this is also a con because i threw it away .	1	1
1	basically , this was the worst roll i could imagine .	1	1
1	this smell will stick to you for four to five hours at least .	1	1
1	bland food .	1	1
1	wine prices even higher than paris or london .	1	1
1	_num_ stars for being cheap and delivering .	1	1
1	is it somehow part of the comedy routine that was going on ?	1	1
1	then there was no elevators .	1	1
1	the service is really spotty too .	1	1
1	the service was horrible .	1	1
1	the phone rang and she answered it as we stood at the door .	1	1
1	the internet is so slow it is not functional for basic email .	1	1
1	the bread was store brought italian bread from the grocery store .	1	1
1	as i walked away , i looked at my phone .	1	1
1	coming here was usually pretty exciting .	1	1
1	she never refilled our drinks either .	1	1
1	it was like getting waited on by 1st job people .	1	1
1	the other thing i do not like about this place are their hours .	1	1
1	horrible place to live .	1	1
1	after waiting another five to ten minutes someone finally came .	1	1
1	i 'm just not crazy about the vibe here .	1	1
1	it had too much cheese and hardly any sauce and it was burnt .	1	1
1	$ _num_ credit card minimum .	1	1
1	while we are talking about the meat - why use this garbage ?	1	1
1	so sad carowinds has become such a disappointment .	1	1
1	maybe i 'm just not the kind of person that likes whole foods .	1	1
1	simply a bad experience .	1	1
1	saw a huge roach on the wall .	1	1
1	now , after picking up my dress we realized they ordered the wrong size !	1	1
1	the girl disappeared and no worker came out for about _num_ min .	1	1
1	when i started to eat , it tasted just as odd .	1	1
1	hardly saw any of that today .	1	1
1	no , i do n't want you to take our food back !	1	1
1	the french fries were barely warm either .	1	1
1	and def not as good !	1	1
1	i ordered two orders of soup hot and sour and egg drop .	1	1
1	my chicken pad thai tasted too sweet .	1	1
1	two stars because they seem to not be able to get it together .	1	1
1	reviews but they let me down .	1	1
1	it was very cold inside the restaurant .	1	1
1	drab drab drab .	1	1
1	this place just keeps getting worse and worse .	1	1
1	came here for lunch once , did n't particularly care for it .	1	1
1	which is a huge shame .	1	1
1	i hate to blame the kitchen , but i think it 's the kitchen .	1	1
1	when we eventually got the appetizer the bread , there were no plates around .	1	1
1	avoid this crap hole at all costs .	1	1
1	to put it lightly ; the staff suck !	1	1
1	no refills , no checks on the food , nothing .	1	1
1	this place is just not our usual dive bar .	1	1
1	obviously that feeling is long gone .	1	1
1	corn bread just taste bad .	1	1
1	the staff makes it feels like you are bothering them when you order .	1	1
1	turns out they do n't have mixed vegetables which is on the menu .	1	1
1	saving up that six hundred bucks to go elsewhere .	1	1
1	no wonder mine was stale .	1	1
1	the service is bad and the attitude of the workers is worse .	1	1
1	i 'm trying the chicken tortilla soup and the french onion pot roast .	1	1
1	nor did he bother to even clear our plates .	1	1
1	it 's now _num_ and i 'm still waiting .	1	1
1	but the service was bad .	1	1
1	their market square location worse .	1	1
1	this is a neighborhood denny 's with a bar .	1	1
1	the hollandaise sauce was sour and had a horrible vinegar taste to it .	1	1
1	the menu is n't extensive , so keep in mind your options are limited .	1	1
1	do n't waste your time .	1	1
1	horrible service .	1	1
1	this hotel is old and poorly managed .	1	1
1	they gave me another burnt sandwich .	1	1
1	the door not only did n't close , it did n't fit the frame .	1	1
1	_num_ minutes later , i was given a car in the gold parking area .	1	1
1	long story short , i wo n't go back .	1	1
1	daughter ordered classic burger with fries and our appetizer was the new fried pickles .	1	1
1	i do n't think their menu is limited though , it seemed fairly typical .	1	1
1	i really do n't know how this place stays open .	1	1
1	_num_ ) banana pudding was very good !	1	1
1	very disappointed in our delivery order this evening .	1	1
1	awful experience , do not rent here !	1	1
1	without them i 'd have gone hungry that night .	1	1
1	both were very dry and lacked flavor .	1	1
1	the hostess that had little to nothing to say prior or during our seating ?	1	1
1	not happy about the new staff .	1	1
1	it did n't taste bad by any means , but not restaurant quality .	1	1
1	i gave the management a heads up , and it was not fixed .	1	1
1	the sales lady made an annoying appearance every ten minutes .	1	1
1	i know my co-workers and i wo n't be coming back .	1	1
1	recently i placed a take out order .	1	1
1	the food was flavorless and the chicken was n't cooked all the way .	1	1
1	breadsticks and meatball sub for my mother .	1	1
1	the menu is outstanding but the pizza and beer is too expensive .	1	1
1	tons of garbage and food under these carts .	1	1
1	the drinks were all ice and refills were not timely .	1	1
1	she brought a pile of beverage napkins .	1	1
1	worst serves ever .	1	1
1	not a good way to sell the city ... horrible !	1	1
1	he could n't drink it .	1	1
1	terrible customer service .	1	1
1	it was a wet tasteless mess .	1	1
1	when the oysters came out , they did n't even look like oysters .	1	1
1	service was rough .	1	1
1	the food just was n't that great , and it was a bit pricey .	1	1
1	bathrooms way too small i had to dry off outside the bathroom .	1	1
1	all sauces were too sweet and most tasted the same .	1	1
1	really poor service and way overpriced .	1	1
1	delivery was fast but the food was terrible !	1	1
1	i 'll limit my visits until i find that treasure .	1	1
1	to me , that is beyond ridiculous .	1	1
1	if you are only familiar with mall chinese maybe you would like this place .	1	1
1	i have witnessed same manager return a cake only _num_ slices left .	1	1
1	Negative	1	1
1	i open the bag where my dress was and i was so dissapointed .	1	1
1	for $ _num_ i was expecting something not quite so gross .	1	1
1	here i am on yelp looking at queen 's feast and i see blue .	1	1
1	i have been going to this outback for _num_ years .	1	1
1	nothing is homemade and food is dry .	1	1
1	would n't come here again .	1	1
1	the mashed potatoes were great , everyone agreed on that .	1	1
1	just do n't expect to get anything else out of it .	1	1
1	sushi is not overpriced although the rolls could be made better .	1	1
1	i think it was overpriced for a pittsburgh restaurant as well .	1	1
1	waited _num_ minutes before someone asked if we needed something .	1	1
1	the food was very tasty , waitress was very cordial .	1	1
1	i 've been there _num_ times and each time the food was pretty gross .	1	1
1	the service is bad , the food is bad and the prices are high !	1	1
1	had n't been to this restaurant in yrs and will never go again !	1	1
1	sorry , bummer .	1	1
1	i ca n't say the food is bad .	1	1
1	another thing they need to drop are those chopped salads .	1	1
1	this is clearly a rip off .	1	1
1	as my review makes clear , i ca n't compare the food .	1	1
1	if it is busy expect to be treated poorly .	1	1
1	but apparently , mama has left the kitchen .	1	1
1	but told our server we could not eat the burnt pizza .	1	1
1	it would 've taken very little effort to fix it for us .	1	1
1	woman takes off my toe nail polish .	1	1
1	but obviously we have no plans to go back .	1	1
1	the sticks were not actually pretzels .	1	1
1	i wish i could give this no stars and a thumbs down !	1	1
1	inconsistent service but food is good .	1	1
1	when i come back to charlotte i wo n't be trying this restaurant again .	1	1
1	and not giving real receipts ( they use hand written ones ! )	1	1
1	they took a ct scan but we never received results , still have n't .	1	1
1	the food was awful and the presentation was worse .	1	1
1	but the wait for the food is absolutely ridiculous .	1	1
1	ridiculous !	1	1
1	overpriced , shitty food and drinks .	1	1
1	the salsa , although bland , was surprisingly spicy .	1	1
1	this is by the far the worst hibachi restaurant i have eaten at .	1	1
1	they 'll cook the egg and bacon in their crap microwave for you .	1	1
1	fake italian at its finest .	1	1
1	there are no teams here .	1	1
1	i left my intended purchases and walked out without buying .	1	1
1	service was slow and inattentive all night .	1	1
1	however , lately they have fallen out of bed .	1	1
1	was waiting for my check about _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	why did you return there if you were so unhappy , you might ask .	1	1
1	- tsa agents are often rude and overly aggressive .	1	1
1	no one said a word .	1	1
1	i 've made much better at home .	1	1
1	next , the shopping experience was n't much better .	1	1
1	my _num_ star is as misleading as their drink menu .	1	1
1	the absolute worst customer service .	1	1
1	the owner was beyond rude !	1	1
1	not again .	1	1
1	the sauce was mediocre and one wing ( boneless ) was actually just breading .	1	1
1	giant eagle should be ashamed of this establishment .	1	1
1	the drop off process for returning your cable box is ridiculous .	1	1
1	no explanation , no apology , nothing .	1	1
1	very rude and unprofessional guy !	1	1
1	the worst indian food i have ever had in my life .	1	1
1	i had a chicken biscuit , and the boyfriend had egg and bacon .	1	1
1	mostly miss actually .	1	1
1	they all look like they hate their job .	1	1
1	if i could give negative stars , i would .	1	1
1	sales person treated me like i was a very inexperienced .	1	1
1	when my food finally came , it was all lacking in flavor .	1	1
1	should i really tell him how much he deserved ?	1	1
1	despite their best effort , no cab was there .	1	1
1	avoid !	1	1
1	i rest my case : avoid ten toes on walnut ladies !	1	1
1	could someone have asked us if we wanted a drink ?	1	1
1	this place is not _num_ stars .	1	1
1	i would never go back to this place .	1	1
1	at that time my husband said he chicken was really good .	1	1
1	even after all of that , it still was n't very good .	1	1
1	rubber greasy curds .	1	1
1	i was pissed !	1	1
1	rude staff doesnt know what they are doing .	1	1
1	seriously that is what we were told .	1	1
1	i have never experienced such rude nurses or doctor in my life .	1	1
1	maybe those light fixtures would have tasted better than the lasagna ?	1	1
1	it was hot - very uncomfortable - inside .	1	1
1	i wanted to like it , i really did .	1	1
1	not only was it disgusting , but it cost us about $ _num_ .	1	1
1	i am so frustrated with this service .	1	1
1	almost as if it had been taking a bath in grease .	1	1
1	delivery was late , our gyros were cold and fries were soggy .	1	1
1	unfortunately , the beer is n't cheap , nor were there other obvious specials .	1	1
1	my shrimp dumplings were only ok , and frankly tasted previously frozen .	1	1
1	the beer was pretty good , but the food was a real disappointment .	1	1
1	do n't understand how anyone could give this place a favorable rating .	1	1
1	rude .	1	1
1	anyway , appointment starts and we go into separate room .	1	1
1	the savory crepes were better than the sweet crepes which were a disappointment .	1	1
1	save your money on the chili cheese fries .	1	1
1	excuse the rant , but this just really pissed me off .	1	1
1	please , if nothing else , clean that place before someone really gets sick !	1	1
1	they were very quick ( food ordered and delivered in under _num_ minutes ) .	1	1
1	unfortunately it 's not one of my favorites .	1	1
1	the little copper pot it came in was cool though .	1	1
1	something that was supposed to be a treat for me turned into a headache .	1	1
1	the fried chicken was standard not anything to rave about .	1	1
1	no offer of water , or a drink .	1	1
1	the apps were good but do n't eat dinner you 'll regret it .	1	1
1	hope no one falls sick after eating food here .	1	1
1	seriously , all the people here have major attitude problems and need an adjustment .	1	1
1	it was another _num_ minutes before i received the correct order .	1	1
1	as for the accommodations themselves , it is your typical hampton , nothing fancy .	1	1
1	dirty greasy chicken fingers and very small portions .	1	1
1	i ca n't wait to check out .	1	1
1	the concept is just so olive garden .	1	1
1	but it was a mixed rack ... .	1	1
1	ugly nasty concourse e .	1	1
1	i remember the waiters attitude more then some of the food .	1	1
1	atmosphere : typical chinese takeout place .	1	1
1	well hell , what was your first guess ?	1	1
1	we submitted our name thinking it would be 20-30 mins .	1	1
1	the worst i have had on the road .	1	1
1	but i really do n't think there 's much you can mess up .	1	1
1	the place is gross !	1	1
1	we also sent an order of chicken fingers back ... dryer than sand .	1	1
1	losing customers because you make them pay for wifi access priceless .	1	1
1	the guacamole was tasteless and frozen , previously made .	1	1
1	that stuff is nasty .	1	1
1	do not recommend .	1	1
1	apparently they do n't like business .	1	1
1	bad service , expensive food that 's average at most .	1	1
1	anyway port authority to sum it up , is a hot damn mess .	1	1
1	asked for a manager , she never came to the table .	1	1
1	everything was just bland and disappointing .	1	1
1	it wasnt horrible , it just wasnt great .	1	1
1	its like the place tries too hard .	1	1
1	no , he would n't have .	1	1
1	second time may be a charm but the first time was a complete failure .	1	1
1	service was extremely slow to begin with .	1	1
1	rude , crowded , and most importantly not that great !	1	1
1	bland is the best description .	1	1
1	i was disappointed in the food !	1	1
1	over time i 've been ignored , greeted with `` what do you want ?	1	1
1	this place is less than mediocre .	1	1
1	went for a friend 's birthday and had the worst experience ever .	1	1
1	what a disappointment .	1	1
1	sell your furniture or pay anyone off the street before calling these guys .	1	1
1	pasta trio - _num_ out of the _num_ was passable .	1	1
1	not my ideal chicken parm !	1	1
1	wow are their servers just lazy or dumb ?	1	1
1	they were rude and the room was n't clean .	1	1
1	lots of things were bad here .	1	1
1	the team went out of their way to get us in quickly and efficiently .	1	1
1	i was thinking he would have stopped but did n't oh well .	1	1
1	person on the taking orders was rude when i called back with a problem .	1	1
1	its not that expensive or difficult .	1	1
1	we ordered two caesar salads , and she brought two house salads .	1	1
1	the check-in desk was super slow during my stay there .	1	1
1	i ordered my spicy tuna and salmon rolls , both came within _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	i was so excited to get all you can eat crab legs !	1	1
1	i have witnessed him being rude and condescending to other customers too .	1	1
1	but when the bill came there was none of that .	1	1
1	this time around i am extremely upset .	1	1
1	overall , the experience was not very pleasing .	1	1
1	i became very angry .	1	1
1	for the very first time the food was awful .	1	1
1	no .	1	1
1	he needs to be fired and needs to be some changes made .	1	1
1	my advice , avoid this place .	1	1
1	the salad is bag salad from a grocery store with dressing on it .	1	1
1	as for sushi , i would only come here once .	1	1
1	however , they will not get my money .	1	1
1	but the miss on simple kabobs clearly show a careless staff .	1	1
1	there are plenty of other bridal salons that would be much nicer and accommodating .	1	1
1	it was sad , really .	1	1
1	i 've had much worse .	1	1
1	the hilton would probably have been better or perhaps any of the other hotels .	1	1
1	_num_ minutes to get my order .	1	1
1	if you did n't know where it was you 'd miss it .	1	1
1	i could have done better at home .	1	1
1	they wo n't even bother to tell you that they will come !	1	1
1	i would recommend just hitting the bar for these late night after a show .	1	1
1	in all , it 's really nothing special , just very basic .	1	1
1	this was the worst hotel that i ever stayed in .	1	1
1	no one seems to care .	1	1
1	for starters , the portion of the pho is extremely skimpy !	1	1
1	but i think that the service was absolutely terrible .	1	1
1	very limited color selection .	1	1
1	as it is , i wish i 'd gone somewhere else .	1	1
1	if that were the case , i 'd stick to making my own .	1	1
1	we were ... disappointed .	1	1
1	the only thing that saved the evening from disaster were our server and busser .	1	1
1	it was hardly halfway full .	1	1
1	but hey , it 's pittsburgh .	1	1
1	i will not be back ever !	1	1
1	rude !	1	1
1	they ended up calling two more over , but it took way too long .	1	1
1	on top of that he is very rude and has no customer service skills .	1	1
1	lucky we did n't have clients with us this evening .	1	1
1	if there were zero stars i would give that rating instead !	1	1
1	check my purse , yes , but leave my purse with complete strangers ?	1	1
1	( this might be a pro to some ) boyfriend ordered their house cocktail .	1	1
1	sadly , yelp failed me this time around .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	i rented a car with this location as the drop off point .	1	1
1	disappointed is an understatement .	1	1
1	both hotels feature an open atrium that goes up _num_ to _num_ levels high .	1	1
1	poor to standard food .	1	1
1	Negative	1	1
1	what we came away with from this experience is to leave .	1	1
1	our vegetables were so soft , they all tasted the same , mushy .	1	1
1	not the worst chinese i 've had , but definitely not the best .	1	1
1	they could n't find any problem .	1	1
1	otherwise , i really would n't recommend this place to other people .	1	1
1	there 's not much left to say .	1	1
1	i gave this place _num_ visits and each time i was left disappointed .	1	1
1	there are other italian grocery stores close by .	1	1
1	avoid this place at all costs .	1	1
1	furniture was very dated .	1	1
1	i 'm not sure which is worse .	1	1
1	i ca n't understand how this place stays in business .	1	1
1	con : they ca n't get the online orders right .	1	1
1	this is the worst hibachi restaurant in pittsburgh .	1	1
1	i got a flounder dinner there recently , asked for some extra tartar sauce .	1	1
1	she was clearly in a hurry .	1	1
1	the bagels here are n't as good as everyone said they would be .	1	1
1	i am disappointed .	1	1
1	b. i did not know the electrical outlet did not work .	1	1
1	noisy snow tires in the summer !	1	1
1	you may even get a nasty look , yikes !	1	1
1	does anyone know where the old managers went ?	1	1
1	the makeup mirror was hanging off the wall ready to fall .	1	1
1	delivery has gone downhill .	1	1
1	anyway , the second time i came here was with my boyfriend .	1	1
1	has n't made me sick , again .	1	1
1	could n't have happened to a more deserving group of people .	1	1
1	as tables became available he would seat groups that he knew and/or had reservations .	1	1
1	they then corrected it and charged me a flat fee of $ _num_ .	1	1
1	so , i chose the omelette .	1	1
1	the restaurant is run down , and not cleaned thoroughly .	1	1
1	service was nice , the place was fairly empty .	1	1
1	do n't bother .	1	1
1	a big f for this .	1	1
1	but i will not take her someplace that runs a scam like this .	1	1
1	the cheese was hardly melted .	1	1
1	so go there instead is the best advice i can give .	1	1
1	then i see it : `` this finished product not tested on animals . ''	1	1
1	i hated it !	1	1
1	my husband was afraid to eat it in the fear of getting sick .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	_num_ stars .	1	1
1	i figured wrong .	1	1
1	even my _num_ year old recognized the poor quality of meat .	1	1
1	i could n't wait to get out of there .	1	1
1	having read the reviews , i knew to stay away from the brisket .	1	1
1	on top of that , the customer service sucked .	1	1
1	if not , plan on spending about three times too much there .	1	1
1	stopped here for the 1st ( & last ) time around 1:30 friday afternoon .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	the presentation of the food was awful .	1	1
1	awful awful .	1	1
1	she was sarcastic & unprofessional .	1	1
1	i however , ordered the steak and cheese pita and was extremely disappointed .	1	1
1	the service was sub-par on a friday night .	1	1
1	big mistake .	1	1
1	i absolutely can not recommend strongly enough against this hotel .	1	1
1	just plain salty and awful .	1	1
1	not very tasty .	1	1
1	take your money elsewhere .	1	1
1	and i felt like total crap the whole next day at work .	1	1
1	i get there and the total is over $ _num_ !	1	1
1	do not make the same mistake that i did !	1	1
1	$ _num_ for two for brunch , not worth it .	1	1
1	i would probably not return here .	1	1
1	i would rather go get sushi than spend more money here .	1	1
1	same deal : lots of ringing , no answering .	1	1
1	i do n't know why i even tried going back .	1	1
1	ridiculous !	1	1
1	this is the linens i am gon na go with . ''	1	1
1	we were not going to buy anything else .	1	1
1	maybe i just ordered the wrong thing on the wrong day .	1	1
1	i got stuck in terrible traffic and arrived minutes before closing time .	1	1
1	it was disgusting .	1	1
1	she was basically giving my asian friend a terribly difficult time .	1	1
1	the inside of the building smells really bad .	1	1
1	they did n't even get their drinks .	1	1
1	it is unfortunate .	1	1
1	very disappointed in his attitude more then anything .	1	1
1	are you kidding me time warner ?	1	1
1	food is terrible .	1	1
1	( here as in the city , not silky 's . )	1	1
1	it was a place where everybody knew my name .	1	1
1	twenty mins to close but was told that the kitchen was closed .	1	1
1	they literally just threw the wings in the fryer and delivered it to us .	1	1
1	none of us even finished half the portion .	1	1
1	i dont even bother coming here anymore .	1	1
1	everything else screamed _num_ .	1	1
1	flew through here going to paris .	1	1
1	i 've eaten there many times in the hopes that maybe i missed something .	1	1
1	another _num_ minutes later and our order finally showed up .	1	1
1	to this day it continues to peel off and it is disgusting .	1	1
1	disappointing .	1	1
1	they squeezed _num_ people into _num_ small tables given the restaurant was fairly empty .	1	1
1	i visited recently and i will not be returning , ever !	1	1
1	its crime and misleading to even give time warner _num_ star !	1	1
1	it was a pretty bad experience .	1	1
1	the food is not very special at all .	1	1
1	i talked to the duty manager and he was no help at all .	1	1
1	highly disappointing philly cheesesteak !	1	1
1	you can go out once and have no desire to ever go out again .	1	1
1	the only explanation is piss poor management .	1	1
1	just had the worst experience at a nail salon .	1	1
1	we 'd probably never go back .	1	1
1	not same price .	1	1
1	had lobster bisque soup not to good .	1	1
1	the last _num_ times getting it , i have had issues .	1	1
1	- none of the food was super awesome .	1	1
1	the sole basil flavor of this drink made it unappealing .	1	1
1	fine , i had a sushi craving and could n't care less .	1	1
1	that was really unprofessional .	1	1
1	the food was unremarkable .	1	1
1	the apartments were great _num_ years ago , now not so much .	1	1
1	do i deserve this ?	1	1
1	it was awful .	1	1
1	customer service was poor and unfriendly .	1	1
1	boring .	1	1
1	shirt sizes in the gift shop were limited .	1	1
1	stopped in with my daughter we just wanted something small to eat .	1	1
1	not to mention the constant slow internet .	1	1
1	long review , but i felt strongly enough that i wanted to post .	1	1
1	i will be doing business elsewhere .	1	1
1	seriously i waited in the drive thru for like _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	my brother was uncomfortable and embarrassed and just kept staring down .	1	1
1	the walls have wall paper torn off throughout the place .	1	1
1	parking is atrocious .	1	1
1	i tried a little of the margherita pizza , and it was not good .	1	1
1	nor good signs and we should have walked out then .	1	1
1	it 's good , but too expensive .	1	1
1	- the chicken was so salty it was inedible .	1	1
1	i just do n't like being surprised when the ticket comes .	1	1
1	this was not the case .	1	1
1	staff is rude & snotty with `` comments '' .	1	1
1	our bill was over $ _num_ .	1	1
1	hot water , not much of it low water pressure as well .	1	1
1	it 's unacceptable .	1	1
1	really made me sad .	1	1
1	the chicken was flavorless tasted like flour .	1	1
1	( i do n't eat shrimp . )	1	1
1	i just was not going to eat it as i could n't chew it .	1	1
1	very noisy .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	after the renovation the place lost its center !	1	1
1	at $ _num_ , i was not impressed .	1	1
1	i 'm _num_ .	1	1
1	the ramen soup was bland .	1	1
1	horrible place to live !	1	1
1	it was a pile of cheese in a sea of grease .	1	1
1	this place is a train wreck .	1	1
1	this was a moderately steady thursday night .	1	1
1	like i 'm supposed to be comfortable with that .	1	1
1	this particular location is horrible .	1	1
1	after what seemed like forever , my husband got up to find a server .	1	1
1	i do n't have that coupon .	1	1
1	take a hard right down aisle _num_ and then you hit the bakery .	1	1
1	very disappointed .	1	1
1	the corn chowder was ok but not very hot .	1	1
1	i 'll keep this one short - do not go here !	1	1
1	other than that , i would not recommend .	1	1
1	all of the power in the room was then knocked out .	1	1
1	possibly the worst mexican food i 've ever had .	1	1
1	i 'm not a huge fan of this location .	1	1
1	_num_ per person not worth it .	1	1
1	not the worlds greatest bbq chicken ( sorry guy ) .	1	1
1	please ... take your hard earned money elsewhere .	1	1
1	this situation takes the icing of the cake though .	1	1
1	the bartender gave my sandwich by mistake to another customer .	1	1
1	( _num_ ) they do n't have ready access to email .	1	1
1	the sad part is that its not even the technicians fault .	1	1
1	not a good mix .	1	1
1	it was not .	1	1
1	overall , my haircuts were never good .	1	1
1	2nd experience , today , equally as awful .	1	1
1	unfortunately the food was not .	1	1
1	blah ... and i 'm sad that it was n't better .	1	1
1	i then took inventory of my suits and found that _num_ suits are missing !	1	1
1	, the beers are cheap and cold .	1	1
1	the service is lousy .	1	1
1	with all the other choices out there - we probably wo n't be back .	1	1
1	for our dinner , we were given a salad , entree , & tiramisu .	1	1
1	for $ _num_ , i would have expected a lot more flavor .	1	1
1	the broccoli was terrible .	1	1
1	skip it !	1	1
1	she was unprofessional and downright nasty .	1	1
1	unfortunately , the service is some of the worst i 've experienced in charlotte .	1	1
1	_num_ stars was being generous .	1	1
1	it tasted rotten and disgusting .	1	1
1	but for those considering a long distance purchase , just beware a bit .	1	1
1	no bueno .	1	1
1	however she charged the $ _num_ pasta trio ( which comes with desert ) .	1	1
1	she did not return my call , so i called again .	1	1
1	the crust was not like usual and to much sauce .	1	1
1	waiting _num_ minutes for a cold club and cup of soup is totally unacceptable .	1	1
1	there were _num_ of us and they brought out three .	1	1
1	in a very rude voice .	1	1
1	but then again he knows everything is crap in his store .	1	1
1	went home , made some eggs , and guess what ?	1	1
1	besides the staff being extremely unprofessional , the wait time is always long .	1	1
1	do n't take a large group because they act like accommodating you is painful .	1	1
1	they said they had an appointment to taste wedding cakes .	1	1
1	tonight was the worst in service and food .	1	1
1	or if someone else is picking up the tab .	1	1
1	weak drinks .	1	1
1	fifteen minutes later , the waitress returned , but not with our food .	1	1
1	it was overcooked and turned gray .	1	1
1	harris grill , i think your menu is trying too hard .	1	1
1	no one that works there cares about food , service , or cleanliness .	1	1
1	it 's never horrible .	1	1
1	as i said above : it 's worse than the bureau of motor vehicles .	1	1
1	do n't walk away .	1	1
1	what was originally an average lowe 's has turned into lowe 's hell .	1	1
1	what a disappointment .	1	1
1	another of us ordered the chicken parm ( $ _num_ ) .	1	1
1	i am totally appalled that this would happen .	1	1
1	i put up with the rude employees and dirty store because of this .	1	1
1	good place _num_ a large group to drink get apps tho .	1	1
1	they did n't let people in because they claimed the room was not ready .	1	1
1	i will find a more customer oriented business that appreciates customers .	1	1
1	i will not go again .	1	1
1	if given the chance again i would n't have another party here .	1	1
1	we were so excited to try this after all the hype .	1	1
1	so i would say , sure - check them out .	1	1
1	so , i get online again , and guess what ?	1	1
1	i do n't know why anyone would go here twice .	1	1
1	you 'll save $ $ , time , and frustration !	1	1
1	i would never use them again .	1	1
1	in a bad frame of mind , i tried my food .	1	1
1	cheese fries , burgers , some salads , mediocre pasta , etc .	1	1
1	completely unprofessional and ridiculous .	1	1
1	the calamari was not tough .	1	1
1	we will not be back .	1	1
1	i had my reservations about stopping at this location tonight .	1	1
1	not worth it .	1	1
1	anyway - i wo n't be heading back anytime soon !	1	1
1	this place was not so good .	1	1
1	service was awful .	1	1
1	very condescending people .	1	1
1	, but a couple places in charlotte made me like it again .	1	1
1	i will not be coming back .	1	1
1	then she suggested i leave a voicemail for brenda the head of housekeeping .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	came back _num_ minutes later with lame lie .	1	1
1	sorry panda ; this loyal customer has had enough .	1	1
1	so , after all was said and done , my sandwich was just ok .	1	1
1	why does pittsburgh have to be so weird ?	1	1
1	the good : the ladies who run the registers are personable and helpful .	1	1
1	pretty awful entrees , sushi was n't bad and decent service .	1	1
1	we wo n't be back to this one .	1	1
1	after i told her my order she repeated something completely different .	1	1
1	coffee makers were loudly talking , and seemed annoyed at my presence .	1	1
1	no one else would help me .	1	1
1	i did n't even eat all of it .	1	1
1	the bar is really small and the staff was really unfriendly .	1	1
1	neither one greeted me or asked me what i would have like to order .	1	1
1	their food was extremely heavy and could only eat one full plate .	1	1
1	zero stars for this guy .	1	1
1	it was horrible .	1	1
1	when make turns , there is noise from front wheel .	1	1
1	i waited _num_ minutes at the bar for someone to just acknowledge my presence .	1	1
1	other times , it does n't seem so busy .	1	1
1	terrible terrible service .	1	1
1	no response to my concerns .	1	1
1	years and years of spilled food / blood from the meat department and etc .	1	1
1	this whole department is insane .	1	1
1	ridiculous .	1	1
1	would not suggest this place to anyone .	1	1
1	service was cheerful though .	1	1
1	i also thought it was extremely over priced .	1	1
1	went there with friends for the first time and felt quite disappointed .	1	1
1	not one employee even said hello !	1	1
1	she did n't rush us , and made good wine recommendations .	1	1
1	if _num_ stars were possible i 'd give em .	1	1
1	also : $ _num_ for pho does not make for hole-in-the-wall pricing .	1	1
1	horrible .	1	1
1	clothes were n't pressed correctly & they 're expensive .	1	1
1	as for my mushroom and cheese omelette , the cheese was lacking .	1	1
1	i 'm not really a messy eater , but come on !	1	1
1	it 's not .	1	1
1	for the prices at this place , i had hoped for so much more .	1	1
1	i 've never had a staring contest with a hostess before .	1	1
1	the rooms are just worn out and in mighty need of a facelift .	1	1
1	there are much better places to shop for thrift in pittsburgh !	1	1
1	she offered no further help and i offered no further business .	1	1
1	grilled asparagus ( $ _num_ ) it was ok ... but just ok .	1	1
1	absolutely worst customer service for a hotel ever !	1	1
1	that was definitely not the case though .	1	1
1	the onions were huge chunks and the mushrooms were straight from a can .	1	1
1	hubby did n't mind his , my was terrible ... horrendous .	1	1
1	terrible .	1	1
1	why could n't they take a couple minutes and wrap our gift for us ?	1	1
1	ugh .	1	1
1	fish was not fresh .	1	1
1	dont hire these people .	1	1
1	the service is awful .	1	1
1	overall :	1	1
1	the small package was _num_ dollars .	1	1
1	my expectations were not that high .	1	1
1	the outlets along the bed wall do n't work at all .	1	1
1	horrible customer service .	1	1
1	cue _num_ minutes after that - finally received our entrees .	1	1
1	security lines are ridiculous .	1	1
1	how can a seafood place serve terrible seafood ?	1	1
1	i have probably rented from over a _num_ different hertz locations .	1	1
1	this is the worst spot on walnut st !	1	1
1	yes , just like a bad date , we were done in _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	the staff is rude and store is usually very dirty .	1	1
1	she did not ask us anything when we were shopping .	1	1
1	there was hardly any meat to be had .	1	1
1	i warn you dear pirates -- it wo n't be pretty .	1	1
1	the character of the place was great but could use a little tlc .	1	1
1	gross .	1	1
1	i 've been here numerous times with the same results .	1	1
1	we 'll feed these to our dogs when we get home .	1	1
1	never been before and went on a thursday night at 6pm before a show .	1	1
1	i dunno .	1	1
1	next week i happily tried to repeat the last order i got .	1	1
1	car did n't work .	1	1
1	all bad news .	1	1
1	both of us ordered pancakes mine was regular pancakes and my husband was blueberry .	1	1
1	so , we again waited & never did see a server .	1	1
1	there is no question that it has everything you could want .	1	1
1	small dogs may be different .	1	1
1	terrible service .	1	1
1	like one reviewer below mentioned , this is just a step above olive garden .	1	1
1	unfortunately we choose cousins .	1	1
1	he was very rude to us .	1	1
1	do n't trust this pace .	1	1
1	you do not pay hundreds of dollars for less than perfect service .	1	1
1	i stopped by the chicken box to grab lunch today .	1	1
1	that 's about as far as it goes though .	1	1
1	i can not recommend this company .	1	1
1	nothing special .	1	1
1	in practice , it 's not very pleasant to go there .	1	1
1	tiffany prices with kay jewelers selection .	1	1
1	we ca n't believe it .	1	1
1	but it 's not great .	1	1
1	too bad i 'm on vacation now .	1	1
1	what a horrible experience .	1	1
1	do not believe he cares about his patients .	1	1
1	possible the most frustrating company i have ever interacted with .	1	1
1	the service was laughable , and i have zero desire to ever go back .	1	1
1	it 's never open ... not even at 6:30 pm on a thursday .	1	1
1	_num_ fights broke out while we were there .	1	1
1	after waiting way too long to even be acknowledged , my order was taken .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	service was mediocre .	1	1
1	nothing special there .	1	1
1	i made reservation and still the table was not ready .	1	1
1	from the other reviews it seems i did n't miss anything .	1	1
1	he asked me if i had $ _num_ cash on me .	1	1
1	it was terrible waiting in line , but it moved quickly .	1	1
1	went once , only due to bad weather , and would never go again .	1	1
1	why every time i come in here , it 's really hot ?	1	1
1	but i figured why not maybe they ordered the wrong thing .	1	1
1	even the server commented on the lack of a sauce .	1	1
1	unfortunately , that was the high point of this service .	1	1
1	but then he asks if he can see the earrings and necklace .	1	1
1	the place was more of a hole in the wall then i can appreciate .	1	1
1	quickly losing stars .	1	1
1	such a shame about this place .	1	1
1	management very rude and customer service is very poor .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	went to this store today and it was worse than usual .	1	1
1	tonight was my second attempt here .	1	1
1	i was horrified - however did not know where else to go .	1	1
1	i was n't impressed at all .	1	1
1	mom and i both ordered the fish sandwich with mac n cheese .	1	1
1	i checked out as quickly as possible and nearly ran out of the store .	1	1
1	the lasagne i ordered was flavorless as well .	1	1
1	another twenty six minutes pass and husbands food comes .	1	1
1	it was quite small though .	1	1
1	soups could have been a bit more full in the cups .	1	1
1	the worst everything .	1	1
1	everything else ( except the friends ) was disappointing .	1	1
1	i have never had anything like this , and there have been bad ones .	1	1
1	the peaches were n't even sweet .	1	1
1	no consideration to the value of our time .	1	1
1	so completely frustrating .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	the descriptions were nice but the food did n't live up to it .	1	1
1	her response , i 'm waiting on biscuits .	1	1
1	very strange and inappropriate comments coming out of one worker in particular .	1	1
1	they took to long ... bad customer service .	1	1
1	tandoori chicken does n't taste like one etc .	1	1
1	oh , no !	1	1
1	for $ _num_ a person it was terrible .	1	1
1	why does n't the schedule know this ?	1	1
1	the fruit was mediocre .	1	1
1	being a pastry chef myself , i had to try it .	1	1
1	not much pineapple in the chicken pineapple dish .	1	1
1	the dining area is brighter than the rest of the restaurant .	1	1
1	the clerk said she was sorry .	1	1
1	they need to be cleaning this dirty restaurant .	1	1
1	we would be paying several hundred dollars to get the doors installed .	1	1
1	worst service i have ever experienced .	1	1
1	my eggs benedict was good , so was my bloody mary .	1	1
1	this is called no mayo .	1	1
1	i showed the lady the picture of my desired bang .	1	1
1	it was also fairly small , but that was almost to be expected .	1	1
1	the manager here needs better training .	1	1
1	the blackened chicken wrap was boring .	1	1
1	employees would much rather carry inappropriate conversations for the work place than assist .	1	1
1	try panera bread across the street .	1	1
1	but bags were covered in grease .	1	1
1	i would n't recommend this place .	1	1
1	i returned my beer and ordered a draft .	1	1
1	the three people i dealt with were all rude and careless .	1	1
1	wifi is spotty .	1	1
1	that completely turned us away from this restaurant .	1	1
1	i give a _num_ rating only because of the service .	1	1
1	the food however was not .	1	1
1	we continued to wait another _num_ minutes then decided to leave .	1	1
1	i just found the worst breakfast spot in pittsburgh .	1	1
1	this showmars is under new management and it sucks !	1	1
1	both salad looked like they been sitting out for awhile .	1	1
1	horrible !	1	1
1	the leasing office is racist .	1	1
1	i could n't help myself .	1	1
1	for a $ _num_ meal each , not great .	1	1
1	def not worth the wait .	1	1
1	just awful !	1	1
1	my husband and i have been going to wan fu for years .	1	1
1	no thank you or thanks for you patience .	1	1
1	i 'm terrified of those things .	1	1
1	`` i completely understand your frustration .	1	1
1	fake words aside , this pizza really sucks guys .	1	1
1	i sat in the little snack area and drank it .	1	1
1	bad food .	1	1
1	the chicken sandwich was burnt and you cook smell the burn !	1	1
1	worst bk ever .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	granted , i like to host social events .	1	1
1	its just sooo unprofessional and annoying .	1	1
1	no management present that we could see .	1	1
1	they did have a free petting zoo and horse ride was eight dollars .	1	1
1	gross .	1	1
1	management said there was nothing they could do about it .	1	1
1	got a bang trim , a low # _num_ cut , and a wash .	1	1
1	you are willing to piss off a client and make _num_ dollars .	1	1
1	that goes for the dated , smelly theater as well .	1	1
1	_num_ which seems to be a never ending construction zone .	1	1
1	they just need a better starting product !	1	1
1	wo n't be going back even though the bagels are okay .	1	1
1	drinks were ordered and were unbelievably slow .	1	1
1	they charge at least $ _num_ more for bridesmaids alteration of a short dress .	1	1
1	i long for a real deli in charlotte !	1	1
1	ordered my pizza tonight via website .	1	1
1	the bathroom was gross , no words other than that can describe it .	1	1
1	and you just lost all of our business .	1	1
1	ashley furniture will get my business from now on .	1	1
1	the service is rather incompetent .	1	1
1	go back to the way it was done before .	1	1
1	went for dinner , service was terrible , food was worse .	1	1
1	i was really excited to hear that they had smoked salmon .	1	1
1	thank you for wasting my time , i wo n't be back .	1	1
1	very disappointed !	1	1
1	i do n't see how they could possibly have any repeat business .	1	1
1	guess not .	1	1
1	my biggest issue was the attitude i received when i called .	1	1
1	biggest disappointment was they smoked in my vehicle while installing .	1	1
1	it was just strange .	1	1
1	looking into this place , they have no website .	1	1
1	it has gone downhill .	1	1
1	massage but still had a _num_ hr .	1	1
1	the food is bland and boring .	1	1
1	not enough staff .	1	1
1	my husband & i , went here for lunch .	1	1
1	much better pizza even if they do n't deliver .	1	1
1	meeting our friends there for a sunday bite was nice .	1	1
1	it was fixed promptly , but made a bad first impression .	1	1
1	it was such a nightmare .	1	1
1	this was the first sign that it was going to be an interesting night .	1	1
1	no `` thank you '' or `` have a good day '' .	1	1
1	clearly , customer service nor quality of food are valued .	1	1
1	she served the beer in a mason jar .	1	1
1	its owner , gary , enjoys parking in handicapped parking spaces .	1	1
1	no offer of a refund .	1	1
1	but they use the cheapest meats they can find and you can taste it .	1	1
1	i sat there for _num_ minutes with my family and was ignored .	1	1
1	not too good and not that much flavor for what chicken can have .	1	1
1	tried to buy about _num_ worth of groceries at self checkout .	1	1
1	mediocre food and mediocre service .	1	1
1	we did n't get anything , and that was a little disappointing .	1	1
1	the airline put me up in this hotel for the night .	1	1
1	i went a second time just in case they were having a bad day .	1	1
1	sadly that is n't the end .	1	1
1	again , very bland .	1	1
1	fool me once , shame on you .	1	1
1	i had chicken and broccoli with limp foul tasting broccoli .	1	1
1	they were not busy , _num_ tables in the whole place .	1	1
1	came back an hour later only to see my car in the same spot .	1	1
1	the food was mediocre at best .	1	1
1	been here a few times now , food is mediocre at best .	1	1
1	its not very good at all .	1	1
1	it is only a _num_ to _num_ minute drive to madison though .	1	1
1	they 'll try to hit you with a bunch of unnecessary repairs .	1	1
1	so , i am fed up with bad service from this state farm office .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	the place was mostly empty .	1	1
1	$ _num_ car bomb shots !	1	1
1	will not return to this place .	1	1
1	we were very disappointed .	1	1
1	there was no noise control so sleep was impossible .	1	1
1	it was all french fries and very little meat .	1	1
1	ok , mistake .	1	1
1	however , on my second visit we had terrible service .	1	1
1	horrible service !	1	1
1	we will not go back .	1	1
1	they do not have 1/2 price apps !	1	1
1	the room smelled awful .	1	1
1	i mean ... shrimp from chilis ?	1	1
1	)	1	1
1	not a good vegan experience .	1	1
1	`` ok , sir .	1	1
1	brixx is not the case !	1	1
1	she just sat there and read a magazine .	1	1
1	the location , atmosphere , and service were all good so no complaints there .	1	1
1	if you like sandwiches with french fries piled on them , go for it .	1	1
1	the veggies were about average , not fresh , but did n't taste gross .	1	1
1	so very bad that i 'm writing my first yelp review .	1	1
1	it 's $ _num_ a head .	1	1
1	tipping should be up to the customer , not the cashier !	1	1
1	will not eat here again .	1	1
1	luckily there was _num_ more flight that night .	1	1
1	the bathroom was gross .	1	1
1	wan 's parking lot was jam packed and he ate with _num_ other friends .	1	1
1	the company was very unprofessional and rude .	1	1
1	when i complained how they failed to honor my reservation mr .	1	1
1	ridiculous .	1	1
1	so , why such a low score ?	1	1
1	we did n't eat anything so i ca n't comment on the food .	1	1
1	is n't even that great at the bar .	1	1
1	the second haircut was great , but styled horribly .	1	1
1	also most hotels offer no free parking , shadyside suites did .	1	1
1	the yams were hard as if they were freshly cut and simply plated .	1	1
1	also , they really have the worst customer service i have ever dealt with .	1	1
1	fridays seems to have gone down hill .	1	1
1	very slow .	1	1
1	tables were all dirty and the drink station was sticky and not very sanitary .	1	1
1	the bathrooms are still disgusting .	1	1
1	the macaroni was good , they used cream cheese or something that tasted okay .	1	1
1	earlier this week i decided to order a rather large order to be delivered .	1	1
1	the pad thai was bland and generic , and tasted almost gummy .	1	1
1	horrible experience .	1	1
1	somewhat slow service and somewhat overpriced .	1	1
1	worst airport experience .	1	1
1	customer service was terrible .	1	1
1	no respect for patients time .	1	1
1	never before have i encountered such unprofessional service at a doctor 's office .	1	1
1	will i come back to your restaurant , i 'm not sure .	1	1
1	the cake part is now dry ?	1	1
1	not good at all .	1	1
1	a takeout place in a supermarket ?	1	1
1	i was meeting up with _num_ other people there .	1	1
1	the service was ok , but not great .	1	1
1	_num_ battery in the tv remote and the phone did n't work .	1	1
1	food is n't good either .	1	1
1	we chose an option for each course of the very limited restaurant week menu .	1	1
1	monday you did n't have meat .	1	1
1	so nobody went home with their own food .	1	1
1	if it was about the pizza you were n't getting it back .	1	1
1	we just picked up a custom cake for a colleague 's going away .	1	1
1	they did not acknowledge me .	1	1
1	i do n't know how corporate keeps this place open .	1	1
1	the food was very mediocre .	1	1
1	the same or better is available elsewhere .	1	1
1	after a long while we realized she must have left for good !	1	1
1	the only thing this place has going for it is the local hype .	1	1
1	my wife ended up waiting _num_ minutes for this .	1	1
1	i did n't save the leftovers .	1	1
1	i was looking to trade and was offered _num_ % of what i paid .	1	1
1	instead all squash was replaced by peppers ... which i can not eat .	1	1
1	as mentioned by others , this road is not in the best shape .	1	1
1	the fish and chips looked great but it did n't taste like anything !	1	1
1	nothing was authentic and nothing was fresh .	1	1
1	this place seems like the opposite .	1	1
1	we woke up late and missed the breakfast hours of our favorite place .	1	1
1	first of all , the store was messy .	1	1
1	she made them all get back out of lines and walk to the end .	1	1
1	he make sure that all of the customers incorrect orders are made correctly .	1	1
1	well they delayed the change for _num_ weeks so they could collect more longer .	1	1
1	there was already a car waiting .	1	1
1	the same problems plague the entirely unremarkable crab rangoon .	1	1
1	it 's just not good .	1	1
1	the restaurant is so small and they have a problem with managing customers .	1	1
1	even the day front desk person was short with us and rude .	1	1
1	the sandwich was n't good want be going back .	1	1
1	like i mean seriously drive past this place .	1	1
1	the estimated arrival time was _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	staff friendly and all but the place looks dirty .	1	1
1	the wait staff were completely absent outside of delivering the food .	1	1
1	i wish there were negative stars i could put for this place .	1	1
1	this is a sketchy location and i do n't feel safe here .	1	1
1	its also extremely odd that they could not contact me via e-mail or telephone ?	1	1
1	the pizza crust tasted like pizza hut .	1	1
1	but rather good could n't complain .	1	1
1	diner _num_ - ordered the lobster roll sandwich .	1	1
1	all right , now i 'm really done .	1	1
1	price : tasty is cheap .	1	1
1	we went to a wedding only to find the hotel had no room .	1	1
1	for appetizer , we had the kimchi pancakes , which were not fully cooked .	1	1
1	it was cold had a horrible flavor a lot of fat on the chicken .	1	1
1	from there it only went downhill .	1	1
1	this place has gone downhill tremendously .	1	1
1	do not go here if you want quick service .	1	1
1	now it 's getting very ghetto .	1	1
1	the patient is not seen as an equal partner .	1	1
1	i made a reservation for _num_ on a saturday night .	1	1
1	once our dinner came , everything went downhill .	1	1
1	the service was terrible .	1	1
1	wish i could give this place negative stars .	1	1
1	the sauce was to sweet and the cheese was not right to me .	1	1
1	looks great from the outside but everything else about it is terrible .	1	1
1	terrible customer service .	1	1
1	i ca n't believe all the high reviews .	1	1
1	also , if you do n't tip enough .	1	1
1	like , i was shocked by how much it tasted like nothing .	1	1
1	the place was completely empty .	1	1
1	i would n't even give this one star now .	1	1
1	i can not tell you how mad this company makes me .	1	1
1	their chicken wings are so tasteless .	1	1
1	the chicken was all dark meat and tasted aweful .	1	1
1	Negative	1	1
1	highly recommend you find another car wash .	1	1
1	you are better off going to another nearby dry cleaner .	1	1
1	you can wait for _num_ minutes at the wine bar . ''	1	1
1	so i left .	1	1
1	the salad dressing was tasteless , the jumbo shrimp was under cooked and chewy .	1	1
1	they used to have a white mocha but not anymore .	1	1
1	if you have an emergency , go to the vca castle shannon animal hospital .	1	1
1	called manager twice only to leave voicemail .	1	1
1	it 's a tiny long bar just like the old irish pubs .	1	1
1	truly pathetic .	1	1
1	one more time she came out and honestly i was getting pissed off .	1	1
1	im _num_ from ohio .	1	1
1	i wo n't be back .	1	1
1	it is no longer .	1	1
1	if not , then go .	1	1
1	for the money i expect that the toppings will be cooked on the pizza .	1	1
1	at least with this experience , did not have the best server .	1	1
1	so i guess if you want an authentic pittsburgh experience then go here .	1	1
1	crappy hair dryer .	1	1
1	never going back .	1	1
1	i was the girl who came in tonight , alone , around 8pm !	1	1
1	i put some hot sauce on it strictly to add flavor .	1	1
1	so i 'm reading the back .	1	1
1	probably one of the worst places i have been to recently .	1	1
1	then , i went again and it was a different story .	1	1
1	i will not be using the shower in the morning .	1	1
1	giant eagle is one of pittsburgh 's more expensive grocery chains .	1	1
1	worst apartments ever .	1	1
1	the attitude of the workers here is just pitiful .	1	1
1	i wo n't go back .	1	1
1	the room looked , smelled , and flat out felt terrible to be in .	1	1
1	: ( i ordered the salmon cakes which were really hard .	1	1
1	bad idea .	1	1
1	extremely slow service and a rude waitress on top of it .	1	1
1	the decor is tired and old but cozy .	1	1
1	no explanation .	1	1
1	avoid .	1	1
1	horrible customer service and horrible food .	1	1
1	would not recommend .	1	1
1	their service was horrible and i would never go to any rock bottom !	1	1
1	its obnoxious , but it fits your airport well i guess .	1	1
1	as a customer i really do n't care .	1	1
1	really , you do n't get much for what you pay for at panera .	1	1
1	are you kidding me ?	1	1
1	what did he want _num_ % ?	1	1
1	i will not be going back .	1	1
1	when i received my order i immediately opened it to take a bite .	1	1
1	that , or she did n't care .	1	1
1	this trip was bad , even for the price .	1	1
1	my husband did not care for his meal either .	1	1
1	and another which was not the one my husband had ordered .	1	1
1	i requested a firm drive it out quote via email .	1	1
1	the lazy river could be much better .	1	1
1	they are wasting so much money on cheese its sad .	1	1
1	the store itself is fairly clean and generic .	1	1
1	garbage !	1	1
1	never open when you need it , unreliable availability with his products .	1	1
1	should have wait times listed for rides .	1	1
1	secondly , the chef had sizzling salmon on the buffet .	1	1
1	unfortunately , that 's where the good stuff ends .	1	1
1	anything more than an oil change , i would n't trust them .	1	1
1	hot & sour soup was highly americanized , not very hot or very sour .	1	1
1	and i could not have given less of a shit !	1	1
1	that 's not too bad , right ?	1	1
1	it was all beans and guacamole .	1	1
1	what a horrible experience !	1	1
1	the terrible experience happened before i even arrived .	1	1
1	upon arrival , the place is nearly empty .	1	1
1	the food is mediocre , even for fast foot 's low standards .	1	1
1	the sales staff ( if you can call them that ) were complete snobs .	1	1
1	it 's that bad !	1	1
1	it was disgusting .	1	1
1	what i got was about _num_ inches taken off and no layers .	1	1
1	worst hotel experience i 've ever had !	1	1
1	horrible stay .	1	1
1	will not be back .	1	1
1	having a _num_ hour drive wasted didnt make it any better as well .	1	1
1	there was no hot water for _num_ days .	1	1
1	breakfast ( mediocre food ) was $ _num_ .	1	1
1	it 's sad to see a small business that just does n't get it .	1	1
1	i wish i was surprised but it was ice cold .	1	1
1	i could n't eat it after the first piece .	1	1
1	however , it 's not worth it here .	1	1
1	i just felt i was rushed out of there .	1	1
1	my advice : locals must not know shit from their asshole .	1	1
1	wo n't be going back .	1	1
1	in addition , one server working there was really rude and had bad attitude .	1	1
1	sadly really went downhill .	1	1
1	unfortunately , that is about where the good ended .	1	1
1	why was my beer warm ?	1	1
1	the selection here is stellar , but the prices are ridiculously high .	1	1
1	the pho was nothing special and place was small and looks dirty .	1	1
1	they know my measurements , they should know what size i should get !	1	1
1	sure , harris grill gets crowded , especially on the weekends .	1	1
1	the worst ever chinese restaurant if we can call this place as restaurant !	1	1
1	i never received anything and also never ate at this location again .	1	1
1	one star .	1	1
1	sad to say , this was a big mistake .	1	1
1	i miss the old owner of the place .	1	1
1	oh , and we did ask to order many times , but just ignored .	1	1
1	the lobster inside was a small amount , cold and tough .	1	1
1	for the most part they were rude and inattentive .	1	1
1	this is not the airport for international connecting flights .	1	1
1	one star for the ridiculous overcharge .	1	1
1	my alfredo was tasteless .	1	1
1	the wings were the most mediocre wings i have ever tasted .	1	1
1	waited _num_ minutes for rice and gravy and got a refund .	1	1
1	menu was extremely limited .	1	1
1	there are other better pizza places in the area .	1	1
1	like two weeks ago when i stayed here for three days ?	1	1
1	it was a really bad experience .	1	1
1	this is the last time i try this unclean and rude establishment .	1	1
1	i 'm certain they notice , they just do n't care .	1	1
1	the room was very small and was not worth the amount we paid .	1	1
1	just skip it .	1	1
1	rude .	1	1
1	then another _num_ minutes to order our food .	1	1
1	annoying ?	1	1
1	nasty , hate this place .	1	1
1	not crispy at all assuming thats why it was so fast .	1	1
1	very dissatisfied and disappointed .	1	1
1	went to easter brunch , was served some coffee from a can .	1	1
1	it looked like baked chicken that was dried out .	1	1
1	fairly average italian food other than the meatballs .	1	1
1	for $ _num_ with the owner .	1	1
1	_num_ 1/2 star rating ?	1	1
1	this is the second bad experience i 've had at this particular location .	1	1
1	avoid this place !	1	1
1	this is probably the worst review of a restaurant i 've ever written .	1	1
1	i would never recommend this boutique to a bride unless you want added stress .	1	1
1	so , lets get back to the menu .	1	1
1	poor service , menu options not available , dirty utensils .	1	1
1	too bad _num_ stars is not an option here .	1	1
1	it should n't be this way .	1	1
1	eating in the best restaurants in town and when we travel is not unusual .	1	1
1	it was also barely cooked , not crispy at all .	1	1
1	it took one kid _num_ minutes to refill our drink .	1	1
1	the mashed potatoes had clearly been in that serving bowl since the morning .	1	1
1	save yourself pain and throw your money out the window .	1	1
1	all patrons walk through the kitchen to use the bathroom which was really gross .	1	1
1	the pita was soft and fresh but the steak was terrible .	1	1
1	our waitress did not seem very enthusiastic .	1	1
1	that 's total bullshit .	1	1
1	my stomach has n't been right since i ate it .	1	1
1	worst pizza hut experience ever .	1	1
1	not delivering .	1	1
1	well , the short stack they served me were lousy pancakes .	1	1
1	Negative	1	1
1	the staff is unorganized and it is incredibly difficult to reach a doctor .	1	1
1	and they are rude .	1	1
1	management will not care about your complaint and certainly will not apologize .	1	1
1	to me , these are the airport 's only redeeming qualities .	1	1
1	we have stayed in westin hotels all over the country .	1	1
1	i had a pretty negative experience for my first trip to sushi kim .	1	1
1	the fries were fairly soggy and otherwise par for the course .	1	1
1	this place does n't feel clean or inviting .	1	1
1	this is why i chose them to begin with as stated about .	1	1
1	i was so mad .	1	1
1	i do n't know how people keep coming here .	1	1
1	avoid this place if you value your health !	1	1
1	_num_ hours to find the cold remedy i wanted .	1	1
1	the soup was a weird creamy mess .	1	1
1	slow service con this cold and wet monday .	1	1
1	thats pretty lame for a downtown bar just because they were not packed .	1	1
1	- sandwiches are nothing special and over priced !	1	1
1	it really was n't her fault that the food was awful !	1	1
1	unfortunately our waiter was not up to par .	1	1
1	i was going to have so much done , too !	1	1
1	they were rude .	1	1
1	this was n't it .	1	1
1	we left overall feeling disappointed in the service and the quality of the food .	1	1
1	potato gratin ( $ _num_ ) needed an extra _num_ min .	1	1
1	awful customer service !	1	1
1	no bueno .	1	1
1	service is terrible .	1	1
1	guests always mention they ca n't wait to try go here .	1	1
1	very bad service .	1	1
1	pedicure 's are overpriced and they do basically nothing .	1	1
1	the bathroom smells , the menus seem filthy , but i like the food !	1	1
1	they could n't tell us when we would be seated .	1	1
1	management did not even apologize for my inconvenience .	1	1
1	overall , shopping there is a poor experience .	1	1
1	imho that 's ridiculous .	1	1
1	it was actually so bad that we asked to talk to the manager .	1	1
1	this used to be my favorite local waffle house .	1	1
1	the wine list did not include descriptions .	1	1
1	my suit coat came back ruined !	1	1
1	i ordered a turkey burger with pickle and mustard .	1	1
1	the food was so greasy and took _num_ min to come out .	1	1
1	being next door to corporate you would have higher expectations .	1	1
1	was too tired to care at that point so we stayed .	1	1
1	i ordered a quarter pound they gave me a 1/3 pound .	1	1
1	i would not pay full price , and i would not return .	1	1
1	the service was slow and prices were way too high for this place !	1	1
1	water temp on the chair got too cold too fast .	1	1
1	stopped in before the panthers sunday night game .	1	1
1	not bad after hours but those hours are pretty narrow .	1	1
1	called manager twice only to leave voicemail .	1	1
1	still , i 'm not sure we will be back anytime soon .	1	1
1	the doctor said it was nothing .	1	1
1	but hour plus for a chicken sandwich is unacceptable .	1	1
1	i was really disappointed .	1	1
1	it took _num_ minutes to get our drink order .	1	1
1	horribly slow service !	1	1
1	this place has the worst french fries i have ever tasted .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	this place needs a severe cleaning job from top to bottom .	1	1
1	Negative	1	1
1	disappointing .	1	1
1	do n't waste your money .	1	1
1	would have been almost enjoyable if there was service .	1	1
1	i was told that the equipment failure caused the delay .	1	1
1	it was a smoking room - and i do n't smoke .	1	1
1	service is sketchy here at best .	1	1
1	i hate that !	1	1
1	it 's really gone downhill .	1	1
1	bar staff not so much this visit .	1	1
1	the wonton soup i have to say though was very good .	1	1
1	they other employee was doing i do n't know what .	1	1
1	and her response was gold .	1	1
1	terrible .	1	1
1	but typical for the entire bojangles chain .	1	1
1	pizza was good but really expensive .	1	1
1	the karaoke host was just lame .	1	1
1	i ordered the chicken marsala ( waitress 's favorite ) and it was disgusting .	1	1
1	we checked in , put our stuff in our room , and left .	1	1
1	oh my god ... .	1	1
1	i originally ordered over the phone the delivery time was _num_ mins .	1	1
1	maybe i went on a bad day but the food was pretty darn terrible .	1	1
1	they used real garlic and it was served with it - minced .	1	1
1	loud , loud , loud !	1	1
1	if i could give negative stars i would .	1	1
1	crust not cooked enough etc i hope this is not a trend .	1	1
1	i was given a sofa bed to sleep on .	1	1
1	do n't try to stay when the experience is that bad .	1	1
1	maybe the hot dog is cold , but the chili is hot .	1	1
1	beware !	1	1
1	overall , the experience was horrible .	1	1
1	i spent days on the toilet after eating the pizza .	1	1
1	i got food poisoning and was so sick .	1	1
1	i ate _num_ bites and threw it away .	1	1
1	creole tasted like a can of crushed tomatoes .	1	1
1	worst experience .	1	1
1	lots of people running around like crazy and if your understaffed hire more people !	1	1
1	i do n't enjoy doing it .	1	1
1	never received a refill on my soda .	1	1
1	very bland .	1	1
1	but my date returned and relaxed with a glass of wine as we chatted .	1	1
1	the deal is kind of fake to bring people here !	1	1
1	the only thing that was remotely redeeming was the cornbread , that was good .	1	1
1	wo n't be back .	1	1
1	me and my wife went here for dinner tonight and the food was horrible !	1	1
1	however , they have several cooked selections .	1	1
1	the only thing i liked was their ranch sauce .	1	1
1	the waiter was young and inexperienced .	1	1
1	drinks are at least $ _num_ a pop .	1	1
1	not a word in _num_ months .	1	1
1	a poached egg on top ?	1	1
1	so beware , you are paying to dollar !	1	1
1	you need a new chef , immediately .	1	1
1	( the hoagie bun was better than average . )	1	1
1	poor service !	1	1
1	i ordered steamed broccoli and he ordered mashed potatoes .	1	1
1	let me tell you , this place is a big let down .	1	1
1	this place is terrible !	1	1
1	the worst customer service ever !	1	1
1	did n't go so well .	1	1
1	the food was also not too good .	1	1
1	i could n't stand to eat more than half .	1	1
1	would 've been so simple to just acknowledge me and offer some service .	1	1
1	the bf and i got lost around pittsburgh for _num_ min .	1	1
1	not all the prices are on the website , which makes for difficult planning .	1	1
1	felt like someone was holding my whole body down .	1	1
1	horrible .	1	1
1	disappointing .	1	1
1	needless to say , my cannoli was awful .	1	1
1	till then , it 's hit or miss !	1	1
1	just bad .	1	1
1	one of the worst restaurant experiences .	1	1
1	it was awful .	1	1
1	i will not eat here again .	1	1
1	chicken fried chicken for three of us and my wife had the sizzling peppers .	1	1
1	it 's bad .	1	1
1	tried using the online order store pickup with the hopes of increased efficiency .	1	1
1	ridiculous i will never patronize again .	1	1
1	the caesar salad was fine , but not inspiring .	1	1
1	however , lately i 'm becoming more and more frustrated by the store .	1	1
1	terrible .	1	1
1	food was not awful , but just barely average .	1	1
1	i informed him i had about _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	the chicken tasted suspect and the rice was mushy .	1	1
1	do n't go here if you require food that has some kind of flavor .	1	1
1	unfortunately , the service we were given ruined our overall experience at buffalo blues .	1	1
1	plates that are old and worn .	1	1
1	the nachos were the worst i 've ever had .	1	1
1	mortified by this , my wife and i quickly finished and left .	1	1
1	the servers were not friendly .	1	1
1	i have driven _num_ miles in the car since beginning of september .	1	1
1	bland again and very chewy .	1	1
1	my first time at primanti bros in pittsburgh , pa .	1	1
1	the food was not prepared well .	1	1
1	wow , this thing is horrible .	1	1
1	do n't expect great results no matter how much money you spend .	1	1
1	no excuse for dirty .	1	1
1	it 's probably a better level of ordinary .	1	1
1	walked off the job and all the work completed was not done properly .	1	1
1	not a medium .	1	1
1	i just did n't feel satisfied at the end of my meal .	1	1
1	- ambiance is nice , upscale , not too loud .	1	1
1	after the 7th time being pushed away , i am taking my business elsewhere .	1	1
1	coming here you get the feeling they have n't changed much .	1	1
1	i did n't like the crust , or the sauce and it arrived lukewarm .	1	1
1	shrimp tacos were ok just on a basic bed of slaw for $ _num_ .	1	1
1	horrible service and horrible food !	1	1
1	the only items that are good there are the bacon and toast .	1	1
1	extremely disappointing and appalling .	1	1
1	pretty disappointed in my service here the other day .	1	1
1	i was sooooo disappointed with this hotel .	1	1
1	one thing i like about the store is the proximity to my house .	1	1
1	also , what kind of idiot buys bottled water as a gift ?	1	1
1	this is a store that could really use a face lift .	1	1
1	food is cheap but portions are small .	1	1
1	crappy place .	1	1
1	my husband likes steak , but -- - i want to eat healthy .	1	1
1	the food on the buffet was cold and tasted old .	1	1
1	she did not apologize nor did she take me seriously .	1	1
1	i waited for _num_ minutes before anyone came and spoke to me .	1	1
1	that was n't to be .	1	1
1	after a brief hold , she came back and said `` no . ''	1	1
1	mcdonald 's is mcdonald 's there 's nothing really special to say .	1	1
1	it 's out of date and feels like _num_ .	1	1
1	it 's been like this for the last _num_ months .	1	1
1	no frills , but not expensive either .	1	1
1	i run several companies and have never run into to this .	1	1
1	also it 's loud as hell !	1	1
1	she shrugged and did not seem interested .	1	1
1	they next wanted to try my hands and i refused .	1	1
1	none at all .	1	1
1	we ordered an app and unfortunately this is where our problems began .	1	1
1	little disappointed with my beer too .	1	1
1	got my order wrong .	1	1
1	the store feels cluttered because there is so much stuff everywhere .	1	1
1	no spa area .	1	1
1	i ate less than half of the meal and left .	1	1
1	Negative	1	1
1	but it was like that through the whole entire meal .	1	1
1	wait _num_ hrs .	1	1
1	they should be serving free meals to anyone they stick at that table .	1	1
1	it 's a drinking place .	1	1
1	my one must get here is the cheesy garlic bread .	1	1
1	ordered the lobster mac n cheese as an appetizer .	1	1
1	this review is n't about the food as much as the service .	1	1
1	i wo n't be coming here again .	1	1
1	i would n't wish this place on my own worst enemy .	1	1
1	really wanted to like it here , but am never going back .	1	1
1	( customer service _num_ ) .	1	1
1	we walked inside to the bar where the bartenders were a lot better .	1	1
1	she , with no hesitation , denied me any medication for the pain .	1	1
1	maybe i just did n't order the right dish .	1	1
1	and it is ugly .	1	1
1	i love hampton hotels more than anything but this was a terrible experience .	1	1
1	from everyone , including bartenders , which is strange to say the least .	1	1
1	dry chicken , bland help , yay it 's southpark .	1	1
1	ok , so they were n't bad , but the fish was dry .	1	1
1	my server was horrific .	1	1
1	oh and drinks for lunch are very expensive !	1	1
1	here i am on yelp looking at queen 's feast and i see blue .	1	1
1	we were very disappointed .	1	1
1	no sincere apology .	1	1
1	do n't stay here if a good night 's sleep is your goal .	1	1
1	it was about _num_ inches off the ground !	1	1
1	save yourself the headache and stay away from this establishment .	1	1
1	waitress amber was courteous and attentive .	1	1
1	another losing season .	1	1
1	again this is pittsburgh not philly , dc , or ny .	1	1
1	the food is terrible .	1	1
1	the sitting area was a nice size and the kitchenette area was clean .	1	1
1	my favorite is the beef noodle and the pig feet .	1	1
1	each time , i ask myself , `` why am i going back ? ''	1	1
1	i ate there over the christmas holidays .	1	1
1	it 's generic , it 's dull , and it 's over rated .	1	1
1	not the way to do it .	1	1
1	mediocre food , horrible service , zero follow through .	1	1
1	i probably would not go back .	1	1
1	great service but the sashimi was bad .	1	1
1	did n't get any refills .	1	1
1	she finds anything to charge you to get extra money out of you .	1	1
1	additionally , the experience at the salon left much to be desired .	1	1
1	as late as it was , there was no offer to comp the pizza .	1	1
1	i could n't chew the steak .	1	1
1	disappointing .	1	1
1	it looks like they do n't vacuum very often .	1	1
1	guess i got spoiled by the washington post .	1	1
1	sometimes i ate there _num_ or _num_ times a month .	1	1
1	how far we have fallen .	1	1
1	the associates are slow and rude .	1	1
1	do not waste your money .	1	1
1	the third haircut was just awful : styled awful , looked strange .	1	1
1	they move super slow and were n't helpful at all .	1	1
1	avoid this place !	1	1
1	besides the limited parking , i would not want to leave my car here .	1	1
1	but it seemed like i was absolutely bothering the staff this morning .	1	1
1	i was pretty disappointed .	1	1
1	overcooked and dry , dry , dry .	1	1
1	i was thinking this place might be like that .	1	1
1	my pizza was okay , nothing yummy .	1	1
1	nothing raw , nothing green , nothing fresh , not even as an ingredient .	1	1
1	that is not a way to earn anyone 's business !	1	1
1	not pleased at all with their professionalism .	1	1
1	hardly worthy of mention here a decade later .	1	1
1	- the usual crap they sell to people because they think they are idiots .	1	1
1	my food was terrible .	1	1
1	another less than impressive showing by hertz .	1	1
1	i do n't know why i keep going back to this place .	1	1
1	rather disappointed .	1	1
1	so nasty .	1	1
1	but the clams casino were inedible .	1	1
1	i canceled my membership and they lost a customer for life .	1	1
1	it was not superior by any means but very nice for the average express .	1	1
1	unfortunately , mike & tony 's closes by 6pm .	1	1
1	it took an hour to get my mediocre wings .	1	1
1	as for the food , it was just okay .	1	1
1	carowinds in my opinion is crap .	1	1
1	the woman who answers the phone is kinda rude .	1	1
1	this has got to be the most overrated restaurant in charlotte .	1	1
1	find a better management who does n't take your money and piss on you .	1	1
1	the service was n't good at all .	1	1
1	either way , no need for rudeness .	1	1
1	the toast was good , but i was too full to keep eating .	1	1
1	it was not a busy night so it was a bit disappointing .	1	1
1	two words ... ... keep driving !	1	1
1	to me , thats a big factor in rating restaurants .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	the drive thru line is always too long and moves too slowly .	1	1
1	terrible customer service at the cafe over the weekend .	1	1
1	actually there was nothing basement like about it .	1	1
1	the main ingredients just seem to be lacking in quality .	1	1
1	looked like it had n't been cleaned in a month .	1	1
1	a friend of mine had a philly cheesesteak that used ground beef .	1	1
1	the service was also overwhelmed and really slow .	1	1
1	this is not the customer service i would expect at a high end jeweler .	1	1
1	and the bathroom looks and smells like something out of the movie saw .	1	1
1	i miss the old garden ridge .	1	1
1	and that is not a compliment .	1	1
1	i do n't understand why this place is so popular .	1	1
1	went for the lunch buffet and was very disappointed .	1	1
1	even the stupid fortune cookies were stale .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	service was extremely grumpy .	1	1
1	no hello on entering .	1	1
1	first off , it was gross .	1	1
1	bad service all around !	1	1
1	this company is the worst to deal with .	1	1
1	worst wendy 's i have ever had .	1	1
1	they have `` lost my security deposit '' !	1	1
1	they are also not very flexible .	1	1
1	we were excited to dine at blue as part of restaurant week .	1	1
1	went to the regular line and was through in less than _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	it was very bland and did n't have a lot of taste to it .	1	1
1	bland .	1	1
1	it reflects poorly on the entire hotel .	1	1
1	no tip , never coming back .	1	1
1	for almost $ _num_ , i 'm calling this a total bust .	1	1
1	under renovations until december _num_ , _num_ .	1	1
1	it 's a little annoying .	1	1
1	the food : plentiful and too expensive to even think of buying .	1	1
1	it was gross !	1	1
1	but the worse is the pasta trio .	1	1
1	some customers may like it , me , not so much .	1	1
1	the views are not worth it .	1	1
1	nobody else even ordered drinks while we were there .	1	1
1	a group was sat without the reservation ahead of us .	1	1
1	mushy , times before food was much better .	1	1
1	so disgusted !	1	1
1	who knows how long that sour cream had been sitting out !	1	1
1	most of the bags that contained these watches were missing something .	1	1
1	but it was quite underwhelming .	1	1
1	the concept is n't that ridiculous either .	1	1
1	i may come to have drinks , but never to eat .	1	1
1	the prices , however , are my biggest beef .	1	1
1	the chicken was chewy and dry .	1	1
1	chef 's special was penne in a light alfredo sauce with crab and shrimp .	1	1
1	never have i had so much anxiety having a meal .	1	1
1	he truly comes across as if he could care less , and it shows .	1	1
1	however , this past visit was unfortunate .	1	1
1	very disappointing experience recently .	1	1
1	at the same time , this chain is past its prime .	1	1
1	i wandered in here looking for a pedicure .	1	1
1	also , our damn room key would never work !	1	1
1	not saying they had to immediately hand me my order , but come on !	1	1
1	always extremely slow service and long lines .	1	1
1	i will never step foot in this place again .	1	1
1	i was very unimpressed .	1	1
1	no beer either .	1	1
1	i could n't eat it .	1	1
1	at this point the whole place feels bad for the mother and daughter .	1	1
1	i could n't even pick them up .	1	1
1	food is just ok , grease upon grease .	1	1
1	you wo n't get what you order anyway , so go anywhere else .	1	1
1	when i go to eat my meal , utensils were not included .	1	1
1	the sauce that was served with it did n't do much to save it .	1	1
1	there was no lemon or anything fresh .	1	1
1	_num_ hour wait and then cold food served .	1	1
1	i was also disappointed that they do n't serve brown rice .	1	1
1	i will not be coming back .	1	1
1	the pool was empty ( no water ) mid may .	1	1
1	terrible service .	1	1
1	i never asked for it and do n't know why it was done .	1	1
1	i could n't understand why people raving about it too much .	1	1
1	it was pretty busy and there were people everywhere .	1	1
1	the worst dental experience of my life .	1	1
1	chicken was very tough .	1	1
1	store is open until 2:00 .	1	1
1	the pickles came out fast and were very hot .	1	1
1	horrible customer service !	1	1
1	find something ... anything else ... it is going to disappoint .	1	1
1	my aunt picked up lunch , and left the tip .	1	1
1	she assured me that it was cooked earlier today and reheated when ordered .	1	1
1	but i do n't think i 'll be going back anytime soon .	1	1
1	he was loud , very loud .	1	1
1	asked to refill my coffee and got a cold one .	1	1
1	i asked for a cappuccino for dessert and was told the machine was broken .	1	1
1	just to rent a car for _num_ hrs ?	1	1
1	he appeared to have no idea what he was doing half the time .	1	1
1	let me just say that this used to be a place i loved .	1	1
1	the eggs were under done but the toast was fine .	1	1
1	if i had to use one word to describe my experience : depressing .	1	1
1	luckily the waitress did not put up too much of a fight .	1	1
1	jiffy lube sucked .	1	1
1	the biscuit was even small and dense .	1	1
1	the food is terrible .	1	1
1	that 's the ultimate turn off .	1	1
1	the two jumbo fried shrimp were ok.	1	1
1	unfortunately this is the only restaurant on the lake and they know it .	1	1
1	my hot and sour soup was terrible in flavor .	1	1
1	you 're probably thinking $ _num_ or $ _num_ , right ?	1	1
1	she took me into the room of dresses and said to look around .	1	1
1	no apology , no action thus far .	1	1
1	well it 's not the place it use to be .	1	1
1	this is the worst chinese food my entire family has had in years .	1	1
1	anyway , we sip our disappointing drinks and decide to order an appetizer .	1	1
1	i was turned away , despite the obviously urgent situation .	1	1
1	not something i 'd regularly do .	1	1
1	the sign says it , the looks of this place are not the best .	1	1
1	they offered a lifetime warranty , so no future issue would be a problem .	1	1
1	the cashier was very polite , inviting , and helpful .	1	1
1	this restaurant is horrible .	1	1
1	i do not recommend .	1	1
1	avoid this place .	1	1
1	i ca n't believe this airport has three and a half stars .	1	1
1	i was not impressed !	1	1
1	headed to backyard pools the next time i need something pool related .	1	1
1	both were completely flavorless .	1	1
1	do n't use the drive-thru .	1	1
1	they do not stand by their mistakes .	1	1
1	the first time i got to the car and checked - it was wrong .	1	1
1	the drinks are not so great .	1	1
1	what a terrible manager !	1	1
1	busy , slow and awful .	1	1
1	worst venue iv been to .	1	1
1	seems ridiculous and all about $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ !	1	1
1	it was n't even spicy .	1	1
1	smallest bathroom ever for a hotel i 've stayed in .	1	1
1	service was very slow ass and the management was not customer friendly .	1	1
1	it 's close to my neighborhood , hence the _num_ star .	1	1
1	do n't waste your time staying here if you are a business traveler .	1	1
1	ummm no ?	1	1
1	their sandwiches taste terrible as well , they 've always been terrible .	1	1
1	kind of a dingy version of the walgreen 's chain of drug stores .	1	1
1	but i wo n't be back .	1	1
1	will never step foot at this place again .	1	1
1	finally ... this fee based to get news online is a complete joke .	1	1
1	this place was terrible .	1	1
1	i was not impressed by the food nor the ambiance .	1	1
1	one of the worst indian meals we have had in a long time .	1	1
1	the mac and cheese and cornbread was all we ate .	1	1
1	our second basket was better , but still lacking .	1	1
1	the chicken was like tasteless rubber .	1	1
1	when the police got there they made them refund my money !	1	1
1	nothing to write home about .	1	1
1	worst taco bell ever !	1	1
1	worst experience ever at a wendy 's !	1	1
1	hate security here .	1	1
1	the food was decently made and the environment was welcoming .	1	1
1	menu is very basic .	1	1
1	good food but this is ridiculous .	1	1
1	more business than they wish to handle .	1	1
1	it was a small roll cut into _num_ pieces ( maki ) .	1	1
1	the garbage and mail are very inconvenient .	1	1
1	the top was n't even and was kind of a mess .	1	1
1	employees watching reality tv during business hours really puts me off .	1	1
1	horrible horrible service .	1	1
1	not hearing me , she goes , `` what was that ? ''	1	1
1	just got a shirt destroyed there .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	and why did you wait all that time to tell me ?	1	1
1	the food just does n't measure up to that kind of poor customer service .	1	1
1	i noticed the beer sampler and thought i would give it a try .	1	1
1	they had no baked potatoes .	1	1
1	the counter personnel assured my husband it was no problem to change the reservation .	1	1
1	everyone who works in this airport is miserable .	1	1
1	i have had several of their beers and all of them have been forgettable .	1	1
1	people from work drag me here to lunch more often than i would like .	1	1
1	i have no idea how this has n't failed a health inspection .	1	1
1	i could go on for hours but it 's not worth it .	1	1
1	not sure and we wo n't be back to find out .	1	1
1	however the content was way too old for my _num_ yr old .	1	1
1	it 's beyond ridiculous and not to mention annoying to try and sleep on .	1	1
1	for hours - over two to be exact .	1	1
1	i 'm continued to be so disappointed by the `` hostess '' .	1	1
1	let alone very poor value for portion size .	1	1
1	when we showed up , it was like i 'd never called .	1	1
1	i have terrible foot pain and can barely walk .	1	1
1	disappointed every time i 've gone ... wo n't be trying it anymore !	1	1
1	i was disgusted .	1	1
1	there is a reason this location has such bad reviews .	1	1
1	they still have not apologized when they lost her insurance card .	1	1
1	and that 's not what we got .	1	1
1	i just ate it and it was a sloppy , greasy mess .	1	1
1	i sat for almost ten minutes at the window while my food was prepared .	1	1
1	really bad service .	1	1
1	i really could care less at the moment .	1	1
1	i ordered the margarita , sauce , cheese and basil .	1	1
1	sides are ordered separately ; we selected grilled asparagus and potato gratin .	1	1
1	atmosphere is awesome ... food is terrible .	1	1
1	used to go there for tires , brakes , etc .	1	1
1	i signed up as they knocked at my door .	1	1
1	then the stack was topped with whipped cream .	1	1
1	walking through the halls it becomes evident this is an old hotel .	1	1
1	after sitting there and being ignored for _num_ minutes we just left !	1	1
1	oh , and the grocery store wine was way over priced .	1	1
1	very outdated , and super crowded .	1	1
1	unbelievable .	1	1
1	it was overcooked , like rubber , and served on plain white beans .	1	1
1	we had dinner tonight and were so disappointed .	1	1
1	do not fall for the hype .	1	1
1	five minutes later the $ _num_ easter special came out .	1	1
1	i waited as long as i could but she never came back .	1	1
1	it was like oil on oil .	1	1
1	everything ready in _num_ seconds because it sat under a heat lamp .	1	1
1	if i could give _num_ stars i would .	1	1
1	it was so nasty my stomach hurt so bad afterwards .	1	1
1	i asked for an estimated wait time , not how many appointments there are .	1	1
1	horrible experience more than once .	1	1
1	my latte was n't bad ... was n't anything special either .	1	1
1	ehh ... it 's not all that .	1	1
1	gross !	1	1
1	drove _num_ hours to get to the park .	1	1
1	i got nowhere until i asked that a count of the register receipts .	1	1
1	there were no complaints with the chicken , the only star of this evening .	1	1
1	kettle one with soda - everyone knows that 's soda water right ?	1	1
1	think twice people before going here .	1	1
1	apparently , we were out of luck .	1	1
1	not even a ceiling fan in sight .	1	1
1	it 's not me .	1	1
1	bad idea .	1	1
1	the owner was sitting right there and did n't do anything or say anything .	1	1
1	for my car the average oil change runs about $ _num_ .	1	1
1	disappointing : ( i expected more out of pf chang 's .	1	1
1	i 'll probably not be back .	1	1
1	no wonder they need coupons for customers .	1	1
1	needless to say , we did not stay .	1	1
1	thus , it makes me sad to write a negative review .	1	1
1	while everything was decent , nothing really came together .	1	1
1	do they think we are idiots ?	1	1
1	the pasta was also overcooked .	1	1
1	not even a glass of water .	1	1
1	the only good thing was the lemon drop martini .	1	1
1	i understand , you ca n't try them all .	1	1
1	my `` squash '' side was lacking squash .	1	1
1	they have food , and they even have subs , but a deli ?	1	1
1	i could have saved a lot of money and time and done it myself .	1	1
1	i had a pizza and it was quite bland .	1	1
1	we had reservations , which was good because it was packed that saturday night .	1	1
1	i ordered chicken tortellini pasta and chicken noodle soup .	1	1
1	and the pedicure was really really painful !	1	1
1	this place really did suck .	1	1
1	the restaurant was not busy so we should not have been so rushed .	1	1
1	the wine list is lacking .	1	1
1	found a manager to inform that we never received service or a bill .	1	1
1	it was an overall bad experience here .	1	1
1	salmon cakes were just ok .	1	1
1	our pizza was cold and our drinks where empty .	1	1
1	i will never go back into this establishment again .	1	1
1	anyway , the food was not very good .	1	1
1	that said , i counted only _num_ dishes with any vegetables at all .	1	1
1	here 's where things got a little weird .	1	1
1	which were n't anything to write home about .	1	1
1	in my opinion , sing sing is really not worth it .	1	1
1	i guess i will now wait another _num_ weeks to get this problem solved .	1	1
1	never ordering from pizza hut again .	1	1
1	it was bland !	1	1
1	the `` lobster '' was sparse , tough , and flavorless .	1	1
1	kevin had lobster pasta and i had steak .	1	1
1	_num_ but i rounded down .	1	1
1	what was delivered was a basket of chips and cheese dip .	1	1
1	i am torn on this late night pizza joint .	1	1
1	just awful .	1	1
1	that was one of the worst burritos i have ever , ever had .	1	1
1	caution to anyone having that craving for good upscale chinese food .	1	1
1	the whole experience was awful and uncomfortable .	1	1
1	the quality of all there food simply was not there .	1	1
1	this place needs to be closed - stay away !	1	1
1	the server got my order wrong .	1	1
1	had n't even read the reviews beforehand .	1	1
1	the elevator was broken ( and had been for a month ) .	1	1
1	but not good at all .	1	1
1	this airport is _num_ years behind other airports of similar size and volume .	1	1
1	i had trouble finding a seat since most had trash or were dirty .	1	1
1	its connection is also very spotty .	1	1
1	our waters were n't refilled but once .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	lots of tv 's though .	1	1
1	i did n't check the bathrooms .	1	1
1	the mediocre : everything else .	1	1
1	yeah , that 's why i booked one at your salon .	1	1
1	i called back and eventually he offered to refund my money .	1	1
1	the tsa at this airport is the worst !	1	1
1	try tom 's diner or eat 'n park instead .	1	1
1	no way to find out what is going on .	1	1
1	make sure no flies land on your food .	1	1
1	horrible college .	1	1
1	first time nothing unusual happened .	1	1
1	i guess it does n't have to be .	1	1
1	i am standing waiting for our table _num_ minutes past our time .	1	1
1	i do n't eat seafood often so i would n't know .	1	1
1	very sloppy !	1	1
1	and the food was terrible too !	1	1
1	it just was n't that good .	1	1
1	this place was horrible .	1	1
1	the coffee was just a little off .	1	1
1	shrimp and scallop with garlic was bland as hell .	1	1
1	the size that i ordered required zero alterations .	1	1
1	this location has the worst service .	1	1
1	i just want it right & this ordeal over !	1	1
1	a pulled pork appetizer was passable , nowhere near the dish it replaced .	1	1
1	i thought it was actually not very appetizing at all .	1	1
1	i ordered the veggie burrito with no cheese .	1	1
1	well , it 's been better than it is now .	1	1
1	try as he could , he could not do it all .	1	1
1	she could n't tear herself away from the movie to address me .	1	1
1	ridiculous , especially if they were expecting us to be there .	1	1
1	this is by far not true in this store .	1	1
1	i 'm not a fan of that .	1	1
1	it just looked really sparse .	1	1
1	like many successful restaurants this one too - tanks .	1	1
1	about _num_ minutes later someone came with soap .	1	1
1	today was the worst , though .	1	1
1	disgusting .	1	1
1	too bad i ca n't give no stars .	1	1
1	we ordered the humongous $ _num_ lobster and we should have known better .	1	1
1	drop the bad attitude and step it up .	1	1
1	stay away from time warner .	1	1
1	so in short the prices have gone up and the quality has gone down .	1	1
1	some of the bathrooms were really old and disgusting .	1	1
1	boneless ribs were n't typical .	1	1
1	i tried to steal a few of his fries , which were a failure .	1	1
1	i will not order anything from this place ever again .	1	1
1	the only thing i enjoyed was the wonton soup !	1	1
1	avoid !	1	1
1	however , i will never return to this place .	1	1
1	waited a long time to try this place .	1	1
1	the sauce is horrible and the service is n't much better .	1	1
1	oh well , their loss .	1	1
1	if it would have been me alone , i would have walked out .	1	1
1	ordered _num_ dishes , all pretty average .	1	1
1	i wo n't be back .	1	1
1	i would not recommend going to this best buy location .	1	1
1	the room are _num_ stars .	1	1
1	service was horrible .	1	1
1	later on , we saw them on our bill .	1	1
1	they never fix the problem , or attempt to make it right .	1	1
1	no thanks .	1	1
1	and while you 're waiting , tsa agents stand around chatting .	1	1
1	none of that .	1	1
1	unfortunately , the worst part of my meal were the steaks .	1	1
1	the desk ) until i 've given the room the all clear .	1	1
1	it should n't take more than an hour to make and deliver a pizza .	1	1
1	maybe it is really just me who prefer cold sodas .	1	1
1	i was a little salty with her , i 'll admit .	1	1
1	not impressed .	1	1
1	fish out of water here when it comes to hardware related things .	1	1
1	it took _num_ minutes to get the mustard and mayo .	1	1
1	but do n't go for the menu .	1	1
1	money trouble ?	1	1
1	the desserts were absolutely pathetic .	1	1
1	this is not giant eagle !	1	1
1	its close , so this is where i go .	1	1
1	however the experience here was not very good !	1	1
1	_num_ more minutes to get plates .	1	1
1	better luck next time .	1	1
1	ridiculous .	1	1
1	they topped off my coolant for free and changed my oil .	1	1
1	well since no one would wait on us , we left .	1	1
1	the service was n't bad , and the presentation was typical .	1	1
1	not really what i would call a full size , but that 's fine .	1	1
1	we will not be back .	1	1
1	too bad the food is so bad .	1	1
1	i felt horrible .	1	1
1	however , arriving in clt is another story .	1	1
1	the restaurant is understaffed , poorly managed , and the staff is badly trained .	1	1
1	horrible in every sense of the word .	1	1
1	do n't bother !	1	1
1	the pasta was mushy -- way overcooked .	1	1
1	also , what kind of a market does n't have bread you can buy ?	1	1
1	- chuck the driver for the shuttle is cool .	1	1
1	not sure why it would be featured on the show .	1	1
1	what you are getting for that value is not the same .	1	1
1	simply because of the view i would only go there for a drink .	1	1
1	darts , pool , tuesday blues night ( live blues band !	1	1
1	as for quality , my chicken was piping hot just out of the fryer .	1	1
1	not acceptable .	1	1
1	w h at a shame .	1	1
1	it 's fake asian food .	1	1
1	i made an order over the phone for a _num_ oz .	1	1
1	although i love the store , this store has horrible customer service .	1	1
1	full of rotten people .	1	1
1	second best my margarita ( s ) that our server made was awesome !	1	1
1	i shrugged it off and called maintenance .	1	1
1	aside from that , the desserts were good .	1	1
1	you pay for a choice cut of meat and get waffle house food .	1	1
1	i continued to stand there , and finally she ( lindsey ) greeted me .	1	1
1	do n't get excited like i did .	1	1
1	and once again , pretty nasty .	1	1
1	like , just walked out .	1	1
1	he said no problem .	1	1
1	the coffee at this place was brewed to perfection which a appreciate .	1	1
1	owner is rude & does n't handle customers well .	1	1
1	the service , in my opinion , is often quite rude .	1	1
1	this buffet is by far the worst buffet i 've ever been to .	1	1
1	ick .	1	1
1	i am not sure how someone thinks this food is great .	1	1
1	not so much .	1	1
1	i was quite underwhelmed with this restaurant .	1	1
1	simply awful .	1	1
1	the front staff is very curt and short .	1	1
1	that , like i said , i give up .	1	1
1	they are apparently saying i cant cancel a custom order .	1	1
1	not anymore i guess .	1	1
1	i had a bacon cheeseburger and it was okay .	1	1
1	the beef was disappointing to say the very least .	1	1
1	the young waiter was ok but clearly scared of the woman .	1	1
1	he did n't make a comment but i thought , rude .	1	1
1	drama , drama , and more drama .	1	1
1	bad move .	1	1
1	the managers do n't care .	1	1
1	not well designed .	1	1
1	in a word : forgettable .	1	1
1	receive my check to find out it was all full price .	1	1
1	but the situation inside is fairly ridiculous .	1	1
1	there 's $ _num_ down the drain .	1	1
1	this is not italian .	1	1
1	hell 's kitchen would n't stand for it .	1	1
1	we booked this hotel to stay during an overnight layover in charlotte .	1	1
1	there 's a reason why this place has no reviews .	1	1
1	then , in june , my maid of honor calls me .	1	1
1	the bloody mary was pretty awesome for what i assume is a pre-made mix .	1	1
1	will not use them again .	1	1
1	yep , this place is terrible .	1	1
1	not only is the quality bad , but the service is horrendous .	1	1
1	avocado is like banana .	1	1
1	i needed usually needed to wait and attempt to attract her attention .	1	1
1	ugh .	1	1
1	could n't even finish it , which says a lot for friday happy hour .	1	1
1	the manager was rude .	1	1
1	worst eggs benedict experience i 've ever had .	1	1
1	in addition to being slow , the cashiers i have encountered are rude .	1	1
1	no thanks .	1	1
1	sadly i will never purchase a vehicle here again because of this experience .	1	1
1	i am extremely disappointed and will never order or recommend them for anything !	1	1
1	_num_ min from when seated . )	1	1
1	no pasta was served with the chicken .	1	1
1	i told my friend to forget about it .	1	1
1	the first time we were there almost _num_ hours .	1	1
1	i , like most people , do not answer `` unknown '' phone numbers .	1	1
1	so i did n't pay for the white .	1	1
1	but the dipping sauce for the tots were on point .	1	1
1	this place is overpriced and the service is not good at all .	1	1
1	the food is so-so at best .	1	1
1	this is the absolute worst outback .	1	1
1	cardboard .	1	1
1	if there were _num_ stars that 's the rating this place would get .	1	1
1	it certainly was not me .	1	1
1	if i wanted a microwave omelet i would have gone to burger king .	1	1
1	food : sub-par for your money .	1	1
1	they could care less about your complaints and then tell you some bs excuse .	1	1
1	i will not be returning again .	1	1
1	all of this after very thorough instruction as to where to go .	1	1
1	lots of it , though i guess that accounts for the high price .	1	1
1	i went here after seeing a musical and it was terrible .	1	1
1	do n't sign a lease with these jerks .	1	1
1	anyways , horrible experience .	1	1
1	( sigh ) ... so here 's why i 'll never shop here again .	1	1
1	the bisque was lukewarm at best .	1	1
1	when i finally get someone on the phone , they are rarely helpful .	1	1
1	final verdict : most mediocre wings in town !	1	1
1	the meat balls had absolute no taste , kind of like cardboard .	1	1
1	horrible brunch experience .	1	1
1	no green onions , carrots , and all that other good stuff .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	the quality of service from the staff was inconsistent .	1	1
1	i would not recommend this hibachi .	1	1
1	put the tires in my basement , no problem .	1	1
1	the egg roll 's did n't even have shrimp in them .	1	1
1	food was mediocre as well .	1	1
1	really , not good .	1	1
1	i will not go back again .	1	1
1	the same _num_ pack cost _num_ back in my hometown .	1	1
1	this is a personal experience that stuck with me for years .	1	1
1	did it , wo n't do it again .	1	1
1	slow , rude , unhelpful , and completely clueless .	1	1
1	i am a fan of olive garden but this one is horrible !	1	1
1	the store itself seemed really outdated and stinky .	1	1
1	there was also no pineapple chutney .	1	1
1	some overpriced crackers , nuts , or pretzels .	1	1
1	who cares what i think though , everyone has a different taste .	1	1
1	i do not recommend .	1	1
1	this is the last time i visit this establishment .	1	1
1	waitress said i could double rice , but no soup change .	1	1
1	when i called in to let them know , they did n't even care .	1	1
1	fuck this place fuck this college , fuck the staff .	1	1
1	very disappointed ... .	1	1
1	the guy at the register took my money , did n't say anything else .	1	1
1	it had shoe string onion rings and slaw on it .	1	1
1	never once have i been told the tip amounts at a restaurant .	1	1
1	this is a review of their business practices online .	1	1
1	service was weak .	1	1
1	came in for a quick bite to eat on a sunday for lunch .	1	1
1	just crap .	1	1
1	service was terrible .	1	1
1	she said `` fine '' ( rude ) .	1	1
1	avoid this place at all costs .	1	1
1	the meatballs were greasy and very bland .	1	1
1	we will not be staying here again .	1	1
1	i feel like i wasted my hunger , time , and money .	1	1
1	there are fruit flies hovering around our table too .	1	1
1	it was busy but at times could n't find her .	1	1
1	the food is greasy and tasteless .	1	1
1	no stars !	1	1
1	i was very uncomfortable the whole time i was there .	1	1
1	goodbye lowes ... hello home depot !	1	1
1	this place is awful .	1	1
1	internet is free but outdated .	1	1
1	worst marriott experience in twenty years of traveling .	1	1
1	but : concessions are a complete rip-off .	1	1
1	felt like i was in someone else 's hood .	1	1
1	she did not have a solution for the problem at hand .	1	1
1	it was generous for the `` _num_ scoop '' order .	1	1
1	but this is n't what i ordered .	1	1
1	not sure why people like it so much .	1	1
1	speaking of coffee , their coffee is brutal .	1	1
1	[ the not so bad . ]	1	1
1	like who goes from _num_ 's to _num_ 's in _num_ days ?	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	i let it ring about _num_ times and then hung up .	1	1
1	the drinks are weak as well .	1	1
1	i hated this food and this experience .	1	1
1	the service was friendly but the food was very poor .	1	1
1	gross .	1	1
1	the lunch portion was huge , too much in fact .	1	1
1	never again .	1	1
1	not `` how can we make it better for you ? ''	1	1
1	i am completely disappointed .	1	1
1	worst experience of my life .	1	1
1	it tends to bring in the worst of people .	1	1
1	i am sorry i ca n't give less than _num_ star .	1	1
1	we 're done with this poor excuse for a mexican restaurant .	1	1
1	from there , it takes them another _num_ minutes to fill one prescription .	1	1
1	all the regular stores , plus some of the more trashy ones .	1	1
1	called back and was told wait time would be _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	ok , but that is n't what i wanted to do .	1	1
1	they also cut back bus services and lay off all these bus drivers .	1	1
1	i wo n't be going back .	1	1
1	the rest was dry .	1	1
1	!	1	1
1	seriously how to you mess up a simple oil change appt in multiple ways .	1	1
1	waited for the shuttle around _num_ min at the airport .	1	1
1	i would caution against this rental company .	1	1
1	the waiter was terrible .	1	1
1	worst mcdonalds !	1	1
1	the slice of chocolate cake , while a descent size , was rather tasteless .	1	1
1	it seems way too small for the volume of foot traffic moving through it .	1	1
1	ultimately you will get screwed over .	1	1
1	i do n't care to ever go back and will tell friends to avoid .	1	1
1	the hotel was totally booked .	1	1
1	terrible service .	1	1
1	only good part was an outdoor concert going on just outside of it !	1	1
1	the bartender looked at us walked away .	1	1
1	waitress walked away two times while opening our bottle of wine .	1	1
1	con 's : outdated decor and seating , average food to sub par food .	1	1
1	his side of mac and cheese was laughable .	1	1
1	no way .	1	1
1	terrible service !	1	1
1	all that said , the huge table of _num_ had left .	1	1
1	piss poor customer service doesnt even begin to cover it .	1	1
1	they probably just fry it plain .	1	1
1	real bad .	1	1
1	they 've ruined my clothes on _num_ separate occasions !	1	1
1	its only been in new york and dc for years !	1	1
1	none of them responded to me .	1	1
1	not to mention the price was about $ _num_ .	1	1
1	despite the spa pricing this is not the spa treatment .	1	1
1	i 'd suggest finding bbq elsewhere .	1	1
1	have n't gone back since .	1	1
1	waiter clearly did not know what he was talking about .	1	1
1	overall myself and my friend were deeply disappointed in our visit .	1	1
1	i would prefer to leave _num_ stars .	1	1
1	sadly , this was the last time that she ever came to our table .	1	1
1	the chicken wings use to be one of the highlights of going here .	1	1
1	my wife had a gyro that she said was just ok .	1	1
1	they also have a wind problem every time the front door is open .	1	1
1	this is about _num_ minutes after i arrived .	1	1
1	this is n't it .	1	1
1	a little seasoning ( salt , pepper ? )	1	1
1	unfortunately , the party stops there .	1	1
1	transfer _num_ , to the phone representative ( again ) !	1	1
1	however , they were very shady at the end .	1	1
1	the spice was horrible .	1	1
1	lidia 's was one of our favorite italian restaurant in the city .	1	1
1	seriously , fuck this place .	1	1
1	no apology , just want some different chicken ?	1	1
1	so , better pizza ?	1	1
1	two words : grossly overrated .	1	1
1	takeout is a mess at this location .	1	1
1	service is horrible .	1	1
1	old owners or new owners , it was n't very good .	1	1
1	i do n't know much about about french food so i was curious .	1	1
1	not overly impressed .	1	1
1	okay , i 'm not from pittsburgh .	1	1
1	they would n't even give us a couple minutes to settle our child down .	1	1
1	without fail its always the same .	1	1
1	the service is here so incredibly inconsistent .	1	1
1	the food was ok , but the service was lacking .	1	1
1	probably the least professional business i 've ever worked with .	1	1
1	way too much coleslaw .	1	1
1	the food however was really dry , and not at all authentic .	1	1
1	just meh sorta flavorless .	1	1
1	they seem overpriced , too .	1	1
1	what a shame !	1	1
1	overly intrusive server did n't help .	1	1
1	worst customer service i 've seen in a while .	1	1
1	what saved them was the bbq sauce .	1	1
1	staff training is badly needed .	1	1
1	i read online that it opened at 11am , wrong .	1	1
1	it looks terrible does n't it ?	1	1
1	the only good thing about the experience was the warm donuts .	1	1
1	no dipping oil with herbs and spices .	1	1
1	horrible experience again made sandwich wrong for 3rd visit .	1	1
1	that 's not how you treat people .	1	1
1	i 've had the pork nachos and they were blah .	1	1
1	common areas needed to be vacuumed !	1	1
1	he immediately brought our waters over and we ordered drinks .	1	1
1	the whole experience was absolutely ridiculous .	1	1
1	my hope is that they fix their problems .	1	1
1	the only plus to this place was the super sized sodas .	1	1
1	secondly , there were ants everywhere !	1	1
1	i wo n't be back .	1	1
1	i 'm so disappointed in my experience at the carnegie library !	1	1
1	flavor was ok but the lack of real substance was overbearing to anything else .	1	1
1	it did not even look appetizing .	1	1
1	so far i have not found a good chinese food place here in charlotte .	1	1
1	i spend _num_ dollars on soggy food that lacked flavor .	1	1
1	thank goodness i was staying on the first floor with my disabled mother .	1	1
1	i have never visited a store with such a bad staff .	1	1
1	first place i went on my visit to pittsburgh .	1	1
1	fired oysters and scallops over $ _num_ here .	1	1
1	complete failure the moment we arrived .	1	1
1	the service is awful .	1	1
1	edible is a better word for it .	1	1
1	i use to pass by this place all the time .	1	1
1	the store seems to be a kind of a ripoff .	1	1
1	fortunately , i 'd gotten that info when i ordered .	1	1
1	needless to say , i will not be returning .	1	1
1	i did n't see my bill , and was told everything was taken off .	1	1
1	the food is inconsistent , but often good .	1	1
1	because i 'm not prepared to pay $ _num_ for a single visit ?	1	1
1	junk worse than mcdonald .	1	1
1	here , however , i have received nothing .	1	1
1	most of the counter employees are rude or cold and not helpful .	1	1
1	food was horrible .	1	1
1	i 'm very disappointed with the way carowinds is run .	1	1
1	i ordered the bone in fillet , they brought me a ribeye .	1	1
1	worst part is my vehicle afterward still had a problem !	1	1
1	the chicken egg drop soup was oddly sweet .	1	1
1	what a horrible experience .	1	1
1	the food was decent .	1	1
1	my boyfriend and i have been coming to this place for a long time .	1	1
1	needless to say , i 'm never going back .	1	1
1	my total bill does n't reflect the price of the dishes i ordered .	1	1
1	and i am certainly not a fan of the olive garden .	1	1
1	avoid at all costs .	1	1
1	i got uncomfortable with the waitress so i told another waitress about my situation .	1	1
1	food was mediocre at best .	1	1
1	the agency says that they do n't have that file either .	1	1
1	the service was very slow and obviously not very interested in being there .	1	1
1	had a beer and an appetizer , so-so .	1	1
1	meanwhile , the food was terrible .	1	1
1	my visit was on a saturday between noon and _num_ pm .	1	1
1	i was really excited to checkout brixx .	1	1
1	i certainly appreciated her making the adjustment , considering my aggravation and valid concerns .	1	1
1	nothing special about it .	1	1
1	maybe ringing up pre packaged food is not for you .	1	1
1	worse check-in system yet encountered in my travels .	1	1
1	the order was $ _num_ for hash browns .	1	1
1	there 's nothing about this specific location that is bad .	1	1
1	they are not concerned with quality of courtesy services ie shuttle and breakfast .	1	1
1	to me , it 's just your average , run of the mill pizza .	1	1
1	three of our five meals , the beef was n't cook completely .	1	1
1	my god the sun will be coming up soon !	1	1
1	she got my order wrong not once , but twice .	1	1
1	the service was also slow .	1	1
1	and there 's hardly any tables to sit at .	1	1
1	the gelato counter was disappointing .	1	1
1	sweating at the lanes while trying to hold a loaded gun .	1	1
1	the squash was flavorless .	1	1
1	this place is way over priced .	1	1
1	aside from just being terrible , she was also unfriendly .	1	1
1	the rental buses are relatively quick but the guy that was driving -- suck !	1	1
1	absolutely the worst sushi my husband and i have ever had .	1	1
1	avoid uptown at all costs .	1	1
1	the noodles were just falling apart .	1	1
1	it was made from pork instead of beef with frozen peas and carrots .	1	1
1	it had no spice or bite at all .	1	1
1	skip to the second time .	1	1
1	it is definitely not for me .	1	1
1	all _num_ entrees ( big family ) ordered were served cold .	1	1
1	in short , i do not believe we will be dining here again .	1	1
1	unfortunately we did not .	1	1
1	went for queens feast tonight .	1	1
1	i went to exchange a product , instead i just returned .	1	1
1	waited _num_ minutes for someone to take our order .	1	1
1	huge portion .	1	1
1	it was all i could do not to make a scene .	1	1
1	horrible !	1	1
1	the pair never was ordered .	1	1
1	went a second time and did not have a great experience .	1	1
1	the food was decent but _num_ issues , _num_ major one .	1	1
1	not enough sets and it 's like going back to the 80s .	1	1
1	terrible service .	1	1
1	seemed cranky and overworked and ruined the experience completely .	1	1
1	the service is rather poor .	1	1
1	no , no , and no !	1	1
1	very cold .	1	1
1	breadsticks and salad came out like expected .	1	1
1	very kind , gave me minor changes without question .	1	1
1	what a rip off and so much for my budget .	1	1
1	poor customer service .	1	1
1	there was no smoke flavor at all .	1	1
1	i did not have one of those .	1	1
1	for starters , the food is always served cold .	1	1
1	obviously she hates her job , then get another one !	1	1
1	mind you , our food still has n't came yet .	1	1
1	if you are not facing the stage , the sound is terrible .	1	1
1	but we would n't know because no one ever came to the counter .	1	1
1	the price was fair and the delivery driver was nice .	1	1
1	it gets packed .	1	1
1	never ever going back .	1	1
1	they were again completely flavorless , but warmer .	1	1
1	delayed flights all around and sharing seating with another gate is ridiculous .	1	1
1	i do n't like coleslaw .	1	1
1	not even cooked !	1	1
1	i could n't even taste the crab !	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	i gave one star because you ca n't give none !	1	1
1	do n't believe the hype .	1	1
1	the parking situation is weird so make sure you valet .	1	1
1	they charged us on the bill an additional _num_ dollars without telling us .	1	1
1	`` unfortunately we do n't have that information . ''	1	1
1	the potato salad was awesome everything else was super sub par .	1	1
1	instead , it was dry and tasteless i know filling .	1	1
1	- the fees are unreasonable for the customer experience we get here .	1	1
1	i am a big fan of olive garden but not this one .	1	1
1	we all went home after and did n't feel like doing anything after this .	1	1
1	we also have a horrible neighbor problem .	1	1
1	this place is just not what it used to be .	1	1
1	maybe this starbucks just want to sell all the coffee they made this morning .	1	1
1	i said to myself , this is unsanitary practices being used here .	1	1
1	the hotel subs out the services for the business office .	1	1
1	worst service .	1	1
1	also , not one of us got ours cooked as ordered .	1	1
1	my breakfast burrito tasted like nothing and a our food was cold .	1	1
1	the soda was flat .	1	1
1	i would not recommend the spring rolls they are kinda bland .	1	1
1	looks better than it tastes .	1	1
1	last two years have noticed quality of food sadly going down .	1	1
1	word to the wise , choose another company if at all possible .	1	1
1	not the best neighborhood either with a bar nearby .	1	1
1	_num_ ) what the hell is with the _num_ lbs .	1	1
1	Neutral	1	1
1	they have completely horrible , rude customer service reps .	1	1
1	overall terrible over priced food experience .	1	1
1	our waiter greeted us nearly as soon as we walked through the door .	1	1
1	i just was n't impressed !	1	1
1	do n't say i did n't warn you !	1	1
1	did n't like the presentation of the buffet .	1	1
1	neither one of us ate more than _num_ chips .	1	1
1	service is slow .	1	1
1	to each his own , i guess .	1	1
1	breakfast options in the immediate area are almost nonexistent .	1	1
1	the chicken was soggy , and tasteless .	1	1
1	most time i wait so long i end up going inside .	1	1
1	worst of all , our server gave us the worst service .	1	1
1	there is way better hibachi in pittsburgh , for a lot less money .	1	1
1	there was mildew on the floors of my bathroom and bathtub .	1	1
1	there is also a _num_ inch ?	1	1
1	the items inside the taco were n't that great either .	1	1
1	friends ordered a chicken sandwich and a chicken salad .	1	1
1	none of us even like onions .	1	1
1	i fianc gave me a gift card here for my birthday .	1	1
1	not acceptable .	1	1
1	blood pressure reading was input in my chart before taking my blood pressure .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	that aside , the crepes are okay , nothing special .	1	1
1	gave my family a car and the next day the battery was dead .	1	1
1	i really would n't go back again .	1	1
1	what the hell !	1	1
1	the employees are nice but i get the sense it 's managed terribly .	1	1
1	my girlfriend ordered chicken alfredo .	1	1
1	you might ask `` how do you mess up a cup of coffee ? ''	1	1
1	no good .	1	1
1	the owner is different now and the new menu sucks !	1	1
1	i was mostly wrong .	1	1
1	so i have no gripe with the tailoring itself .	1	1
1	we never lacked for anything .	1	1
1	the breakfast bar is lame .	1	1
1	unfortunately at this location i was n't given a chance to get a pizza .	1	1
1	restaurants : disappointing .	1	1
1	it 's not worth _num_ bucks .	1	1
1	thank you for your feedback regarding your visit to spaghetti warehouse .	1	1
1	no wonder the store was empty .	1	1
1	so that made me excited and i did not hesitate in my ordering .	1	1
1	i ca n't stand it .	1	1
1	are employees required to be grumpy here ?	1	1
1	$ _num_ per hour per person ... with an one hour minimum .	1	1
1	and the veal was dry .	1	1
1	this explains why i got my haircut there so many times .	1	1
1	so what was the point in an app ?	1	1
1	6am is too early for her .	1	1
1	i could 've said yellow for all she cared .	1	1
1	it saved me from cooking and doing dishes though .	1	1
1	the barista came off dishonest and unfriendly with the up sell push .	1	1
1	i wish that i did n't have to give this location even one star .	1	1
1	bad service .	1	1
1	i simply do not get a good feeling about practice !	1	1
1	by all that is holy , do not stay here .	1	1
1	the rice was bland .	1	1
1	might have been a stomach bug but it is kind of strange .	1	1
1	also , they did n't have much of a sushi menu at all .	1	1
1	[ the bad . ]	1	1
1	it begins with no signs saying where the hotel is at .	1	1
1	sunday went by then monday went by .	1	1
1	would not recommend to anyone .	1	1
1	on average probably twice a month .	1	1
1	after all the garbage food you get unbelievable attitude .	1	1
1	then shortly after , i needed to replace the alternator or the like .	1	1
1	i was afraid to sleep in that nasty bed .	1	1
1	somehow this restaurant gets packed and i never understand why .	1	1
1	the icing was not damaged though as they were so stale they were hard .	1	1
1	which you failed , because of your tire .	1	1
1	just get fries and coleslaw and put it in your sandwich .	1	1
1	he was the rudest , most ignorant employee i encountered in the entire airport .	1	1
1	i 'm sure i will be back as my coworkers visit this place frequently .	1	1
1	gross , what happened ?	1	1
1	and fallen far .	1	1
1	gumbo was a bit watery and a pinch of salt would n't have hurt .	1	1
1	car was not in the spot .	1	1
1	he also made a mistake that required fixing after the fact .	1	1
1	ca n't go wrong there .	1	1
1	the restaurant is rather large with lots of seating and a pool table .	1	1
1	i had to wash my hands just from opening the bag .	1	1
1	$ _num_ burgers , $ _num_ domestic bottles .	1	1
1	i 'm not paying $ _num_ to get rushed service .	1	1
1	did n't even get a `` thanks '' with my change .	1	1
1	the spring rolls were good and the dipping sauce was ok , nothing special .	1	1
1	he said , `` no , absolutely not .	1	1
1	they did n't even cover up all of my roots !	1	1
1	did we catch them on a bad day ?	1	1
1	items do n't have price tags .	1	1
1	if i could rate it zero stars i would .	1	1
1	i wo n't come back to this location .	1	1
1	she then brings out the salmon ... gosh that poor friend who ordered salmon .	1	1
1	it was not my pillow .	1	1
1	it was disgusting and filthy .	1	1
1	then the bill came to over $ _num_ .	1	1
1	nothing special .	1	1
1	neither one of my two friends finished their plates .	1	1
1	just average unfortunately .	1	1
1	the overall condition of the hotel was n't promising on first entrance .	1	1
1	the eastern european girl at the register is awful .	1	1
1	the bread was already soggy like it had been sitting for a bit .	1	1
1	i spoke with brian at the desk who was very polite and professional .	1	1
1	at this point i ca n't even get a return call .	1	1
1	the next time i went was for a lunch on saturday .	1	1
1	no empathy whatsoever about the situation .	1	1
1	this will be our last trip here as there are now much better options .	1	1
1	completely disappointing .	1	1
1	i ordered lobster & shrimp `` enchiladas '' , which had practically no filling .	1	1
1	they had _num_ opportunities to assist us with the process and ignored us .	1	1
1	food is over priced and not very good .	1	1
1	it was a disaster on date night , and very disappointing .	1	1
1	spinach side was a little bitter .	1	1
1	just a bad experience all around .	1	1
1	you 're not going every which way to try and find things .	1	1
1	guess the best advice , just pay at door .	1	1
1	too bad .	1	1
1	overall not a bad experience .	1	1
1	this is the worst fucking experience i 've ever had at a wine room .	1	1
1	i gave the car hop $ _num_ and told him to keep the change .	1	1
1	food takes forever and it does n't come out right .	1	1
1	their staff is horribly rude that way .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	the one lady who told us our car was ready was rude !	1	1
1	they would not give me the dogs and work out a payment plan .	1	1
1	i actually found this salon on yelp and am terribly disappointed .	1	1
1	ugh .	1	1
1	glad i wo n't be coming to this location anymore .	1	1
1	my name was the next one not marked off .	1	1
1	tried my coworkers penne vodka , and that was tasty !	1	1
1	i am completely disappointed .	1	1
1	the side soup is luke warm , soup should always be hot .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	the hotel is very noisy because the walls are paper thin .	1	1
1	however , i hate it because i believe the alcohol and food is overpriced .	1	1
1	very bad service .	1	1
1	no idea why this place was full .	1	1
1	but i am never going back again , and this is why .	1	1
1	we left einstein 's because it was crowded .	1	1
1	it was loud - very loud - as usual .	1	1
1	told the test would be $ _num_ .	1	1
1	so i decided to try thai house again as my craving was strong .	1	1
1	sign is blank and all fixtures from the store have been removed .	1	1
1	wrong .	1	1
1	i probably wo n't be back .	1	1
1	one minute later all of our food was delivered cold .	1	1
1	my entree was the combo etouffee with shrimp , chicken and crawfish .	1	1
1	she paid top dollar for the tree because she believed it was guaranteed .	1	1
1	i was hoping to have a similar experience and was thoroughly disappointed .	1	1
1	i was sad to see how far down the quality of food had gone .	1	1
1	this store , however , is definitely lacking in customer service .	1	1
1	i will never use lowe 's for installation ever again .	1	1
1	nothing in here did i want , or have any desire to try .	1	1
1	they never were opened and nothing was applied to the furniture .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	he looked annoyed that we stopped him and showed no level of customer experience .	1	1
1	this place was awful .	1	1
1	we ordered delivery from them tonight and we are so disappointed !	1	1
1	i guess i do n't really have a choice .	1	1
1	they clearly used too much oil and did not let the meat rest .	1	1
1	this time , my car is not clean at all .	1	1
1	$ _num_ bill for four -- sorry i expect much better service !	1	1
1	pasta trio had the worst sauce i have ever tasted .	1	1
1	i was embarrassed because he was my guest and it was my idea .	1	1
1	that is a downfall .	1	1
1	she did n't make my experience at this airport the best .	1	1
1	not impressed .	1	1
1	this is just my experience .	1	1
1	and , all were nothing to write home about .	1	1
1	bad idea .	1	1
1	the room and bed was fine and the hotel did not look run down .	1	1
1	i said no , please , no tomatoes .	1	1
1	customer service is not even located in this country .	1	1
1	with that said , i opted out of the calzone .	1	1
1	burger was okay , but over cooks and not very flavorful .	1	1
1	the decor was old _num_ 's which could have charm but this did n't .	1	1
1	awkward .	1	1
1	it took forever to get our drinks of simply water and soda .	1	1
1	this was such an absolutely horribly disappointment of a restaurant .	1	1
1	terrible service and terrible food !	1	1
1	hate slaw but tried it with slaw anyway .	1	1
1	plus , the ratio of staff to customers is too low .	1	1
1	our server was not at all attentive to our needs .	1	1
1	big mistake .	1	1
1	fyi : no smoking in any bar or restaurant anywhere in north carolina .	1	1
1	the menu is boring .	1	1
1	worst mcdonalds in the united states of america .	1	1
1	we decided to try room service ... what a mistake .	1	1
1	just goes to show , it depends on what you order .	1	1
1	i really like the chili .	1	1
1	saturdays there is a cover for the dj which was $ _num_ .	1	1
1	the food was terrible .	1	1
1	i spent $ _num_ and only ate the fortune cookie .	1	1
1	and the pizza was n't good .	1	1
1	the food was not bad but it was not good .	1	1
1	it 's absolutely pathetic and borderline useless .	1	1
1	the dining room is also a bit cramped .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	cheap gyro combo = cheap tasting meal .	1	1
1	this location though has horribly slow service .	1	1
1	sorry , but this site may disappoint .	1	1
1	first thing they said to us was , we only accept cash .	1	1
1	if this is the case then my oh my how the mighty have fallen .	1	1
1	she brought our soups , which luckily had spoons in the huge bowls .	1	1
1	i told her that was no problem .	1	1
1	got ta say , i 'm not a fan of this place .	1	1
1	while the place itself looked clean , the stylist 's rolling cart was not .	1	1
1	do you really need _num_ bk employees standing around doing nothing ?	1	1
1	first off the management here sucks ass !	1	1
1	firstly , i knew there was something wrong with the server when we arrived .	1	1
1	was seated for _num_ min and no wait staff came to take our order .	1	1
1	that is how much i hate them .	1	1
1	did not want to buy another mattress online .	1	1
1	the service was terrible and the food was not all that great .	1	1
1	this place is one of only a couple open in the burgh _num_ hours .	1	1
1	so , we were n't allowed to sit at the bar or a table .	1	1
1	no sauce much and cheap cheese .	1	1
1	i 'm a vegetarian and have lived behind the restaurant for over _num_ years .	1	1
1	_num_ to _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	i thought it was a bit too much .	1	1
1	not long enough or wide enough for your vehicle too .	1	1
1	worst experience with a hairdresser ever , at this location .	1	1
1	stopped in for breakfast on sunday .	1	1
1	there are n't too many things to see or do here .	1	1
1	now it wo n't fit .	1	1
1	the men 's locker room is always nasty .	1	1
1	i ate about _num_ bites and left the rest .	1	1
1	i 'll be honest , i just do n't get it .	1	1
1	their food , service , and hours are inconsistent .	1	1
1	i guess that 's what they say to excuse the lack of proper a/c .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	the location is n't ideal ; on the side of a busy highway .	1	1
1	it is dark , so do n't expect to take any good photos .	1	1
1	complete disappointment !	1	1
1	my meal was marked as spicy and it was n't at all .	1	1
1	plus they have the worst presentation ever !	1	1
1	you should never have to wait that long at a diner !	1	1
1	rude !	1	1
1	my roasted duck breast with spinach and gnocchi was not hot .	1	1
1	the food is mediocre ( at best ) .	1	1
1	just did n't care for it .	1	1
1	my boyfriend and i decided to split the platter , which was horrible .	1	1
1	it was ok but not something i would order again .	1	1
1	i 've only eaten here once before .	1	1
1	but the customer service is by far the worst i have ever experienced .	1	1
1	the chicken nuggets and sandwiches are also passable .	1	1
1	people were sat after us and have already received food .	1	1
1	had the absolute worst dinner experience tonight at tgi fridays on harris blvd .	1	1
1	the burgers are okay , but there are better ones in madison .	1	1
1	i could n't eat anymore .	1	1
1	things like that really bother me .	1	1
1	the place is not clean , the table we sat was sticky .	1	1
1	terrible service .	1	1
1	absolutely terrible night .	1	1
1	do not trust this days in .	1	1
1	so i ended up taking whatever she could find .	1	1
1	every thing about this place is wrong .	1	1
1	i did not get a chance to eat there .	1	1
1	i am not sure how appropriate is to talk to a customer like this .	1	1
1	worst customer service and business model i have ever seen .	1	1
1	( i got the crawfish creole and my girlfriend had the chicken etouffee . )	1	1
1	finding a good ol ' diner in pittsburgh is n't exactly easy .	1	1
1	her steak was over cooked and dry .	1	1
1	i wo n't be going back .	1	1
1	the room was gross and the shower was disgusting .	1	1
1	_num_ minutes to wait for a standard order is not acceptable .	1	1
1	hope i have better luck next time !	1	1
1	except all of them were yelling over each other .	1	1
1	_num_ minutes later , she arrived .	1	1
1	the second time , we visited in the afternoon for lunch .	1	1
1	secondly , it was not that great .	1	1
1	the burger was just a big slab of flavorless ground beef .	1	1
1	unfortunately i usually come here for the pharmacy .	1	1
1	i was a bit disappointed in the selection .	1	1
1	it looked more like tomato soup with sausage than a sandwich .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	the price is appealing but not worth it .	1	1
1	instead of the amazing tomato bread i got plain rye .	1	1
1	am not going back to this particular one for sure !	1	1
1	i may try the pizza but other reviews noted it was pricy .	1	1
1	my dad would always take me to this place when i was little .	1	1
1	the batter was crispy and the squash was soggy on the inside .	1	1
1	but it was n't very good .	1	1
1	it 's tacky too hot .	1	1
1	it was very awkward considering it was a first date .	1	1
1	the owner has a complete disregard for customers and the customer experience .	1	1
1	shame on me .	1	1
1	, but instead they decided to take advantage of my position .	1	1
1	at this point i really had to use the restroom .	1	1
1	we went on a sunday and i expected a wait , which was fine .	1	1
1	our waitress was good , but the manager ruined any positive experience .	1	1
1	not worth it .	1	1
1	stay away from this group of companies .	1	1
1	sorry just had my first taste of pierogies plus .	1	1
1	rude , unfriendly , just a miserable male server .	1	1
1	the bill .	1	1
1	this location is terrible .	1	1
1	he did not care one bit .	1	1
1	this is not an acceptable response for management .	1	1
1	i can guarantee you we will not be wasting our time in this theater .	1	1
1	totally reminded me of a mexican soup nazi attitude !	1	1
1	too many other good choices nearby to give them a second chance - sorry .	1	1
1	high prices , horrible service !	1	1
1	the food is ok but the service is awful .	1	1
1	rent from somebody else if you have the choice .	1	1
1	not worth the $ _num_ i spent on the muffin and coffee .	1	1
1	the salmon was way over seasoned , over cooked and had a suspicious smell .	1	1
1	wish there was a choice of no stars .	1	1
1	after almost _num_ minutes , the food arrived .	1	1
1	( all same kind of cookie ) .	1	1
1	wo n't go back .	1	1
1	for example , at my most recent visit i ordered the steak gorgonzola alfredo .	1	1
1	not like you starbucks !	1	1
1	the first visit took almost seven hours , not _num_ .	1	1
1	sit back down and i 'll take your order . ''	1	1
1	not particularly flavorful but edible .	1	1
1	we originally sat upstairs , which was open per the sign .	1	1
1	this was really disappointing .	1	1
1	i 'll stick with trader joe 's for my alternative market , thank you !	1	1
1	the chopped salad had weird cheap ingredients like celery and carrot .	1	1
1	it 's not a good establishment and certainly did n't meet my standards .	1	1
1	i could n't finish it and left hungry .	1	1
1	the wait staff is slow and management has no clue .	1	1
1	a paying customer that will never patronize your business again !	1	1
1	he talked loudly across the whole restaurant to staff members back in the kitchen .	1	1
1	i was forced to stay a night here and it was so disgusting !	1	1
1	i am a sushi snob , and am extremely particular about my sushi .	1	1
1	i just hate to see it .	1	1
1	mac n cheese can pass for soul food .	1	1
1	it was not flavorful or moist nor worth the calories .	1	1
1	the one rabbit is ( per statement vet ) not going to get better .	1	1
1	the beer was cold and that is the only reason they got one star .	1	1
1	when i poured onto my salad it was just drenched in oil .	1	1
1	lived there for almost _num_ years , at the very back if it matters .	1	1
1	was really excited to try this out .	1	1
1	coffee pot in our room was broken .	1	1
1	no way , dudes .	1	1
1	water glasses stayed empty for almost _num_ minutes !	1	1
1	our salad and bread came out with our food which was a little irritating .	1	1
1	wine was outrageously overpriced .	1	1
1	kitchen staff was slow in execution especially for not having a big crowd .	1	1
1	terrible service ... .	1	1
1	it was a disaster , a horrible experience .	1	1
1	the food is not so great and neither is the beer on tap .	1	1
1	they know they sell out before _num_ and they only open at _num_ !	1	1
1	i 've been _num_ times and i have never been impressed .	1	1
1	unless your are here for a beer , forget about it .	1	1
1	if this establishment were to be in any other city they would be closed .	1	1
1	then all the food was cold and hard .	1	1
1	no way it got near _num_ or i would have been freezing .	1	1
1	the seafood tasted old .	1	1
1	if you do n't like your job , quit .	1	1
1	seriously folks , the bathrooms here are beyond nasty !	1	1
1	took me over an hour on the call but nothing had been done .	1	1
1	store is usually understaffed and cleanliness is fair .	1	1
1	especially considering the french dip was so boring .	1	1
1	his french onion soup was decent , but my salad was lacking .	1	1
1	the pie it self was a real mess .	1	1
1	the portions are tiny , and the pho broth leaves you unsatisfied .	1	1
1	i wo n't go back .	1	1
1	major fail !	1	1
1	the food was awful .	1	1
1	all bland , boring curries and an always empty naan bin .	1	1
1	after _num_ years of ordering here i wonder if it is under new management .	1	1
1	the lady who works their , is super rude and never smiles .	1	1
1	we had pizza there the other night and i could taste the freezer burn .	1	1
1	just poor service .	1	1
1	we waited another _num_ mins for another car .	1	1
1	no help at all .	1	1
1	if you have an emergency do not come here .	1	1
1	the wait time to check out is absurd .	1	1
1	there 's no smoking inside , of course , but it always happened .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	i recently stayed here through priceline .	1	1
1	i was really hoping that this place would have good food .	1	1
1	it was an okay experience - sure was n't what i expected .	1	1
1	go for drinks , eat elsewhere .	1	1
1	the only thing i liked from the box was the french fries .	1	1
1	grilled octopus : where 's the octopus ?	1	1
1	the company never responded to my questions in the store or online .	1	1
1	the beef pho was sub par .	1	1
1	this is not ihop quality food .	1	1
1	disappointed .	1	1
1	the owner is very pretentious and rude .	1	1
1	lame as heck .	1	1
1	first of all , the pie had almost no real flavor .	1	1
1	customer service leaves much to be desired .	1	1
1	but no good sandwich needs nonsense like that .	1	1
1	if my simple needs can not be met , then i become very disappointed .	1	1
1	anybody that is not would be totally screwed by these people .	1	1
1	bad sauce with flavorless cheese .	1	1
1	so pissed !	1	1
1	been there _num_ times .	1	1
1	_num_ - new orleans .	1	1
1	wine selection is very weak .	1	1
1	lousy scratched up car .	1	1
1	while not on par with new orleans , it 's not without charm .	1	1
1	someone else brought us water tho .	1	1
1	it 's awful .	1	1
1	oh how the mighty have fallen .	1	1
1	overall , haircut & style = _num_ stars .	1	1
1	not much of a coconut taste either .	1	1
1	we left and nothing was even said about why we never got our food .	1	1
1	wait staff did not come to ask if our steaks were cooked correctly .	1	1
1	all the techs are nice except the man ( andy ) he is horrible !	1	1
1	could not have been more patronizing .	1	1
1	i wish there were other options of stores similar to them in the area .	1	1
1	i have n't been back .	1	1
1	total waste of $ _num_ bucks .	1	1
1	i 'm too annoyed right now to make any funny comments .	1	1
1	my expectations for mcdonalds are t rarely high .	1	1
1	very disappointed with this restaurant .	1	1
1	it was gross .	1	1
1	bottom line , enterprise ca n't be trusted .	1	1
1	first no spoon or soy sauce .	1	1
1	the toilet then for the next hour continued to run .	1	1
1	across the board , the dishes were flavorless .	1	1
1	claimed his repair guy was out of cell range all day .	1	1
1	waiting in line took roughly _num_ minutes on a tuesday about _num_ noon .	1	1
1	turns out , that wine was not included and was a $ _num_ bottle .	1	1
1	not worth your money .	1	1
1	the drinks were n't anything special either .	1	1
1	typical chicken place .	1	1
1	oven was n't working so no pizzas available .	1	1
1	i would not recommend this company to anyone ever .	1	1
1	i also came in many times before and the employees never helped me .	1	1
1	_num_ stars ?	1	1
1	my largest complaint is the cut it is awful !	1	1
1	she was slow , rude , and incompetent .	1	1
1	as chance would have it , the owner gary was around .	1	1
1	probably because he knew he was n't getting a tip .	1	1
1	my wife has made multiple phone calls only to have one returned .	1	1
1	pitiful !	1	1
1	they will ruin your car .	1	1
1	they did not offer me a chance to pay for it .	1	1
1	i went and the service was ok , nothing special .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	this was such a sour experience .	1	1
1	in regards to the polish change , it was a complete disaster .	1	1
1	i recently ate a _num_ oz cheeseburger at a local burger joint .	1	1
1	only plus is the beer was $ _num_ and they validate parking .	1	1
1	the mac and cheese was good but again , it 's mac and cheese .	1	1
1	spent almost $ _num_ on a custom tattoo i found online that i wanted .	1	1
1	so far really slow food service .	1	1
1	is n't that your job ?	1	1
1	no big deal .	1	1
1	i feel sick in so many different ways about this experience as a whole .	1	1
1	it was awful we could n't find any positive in it .	1	1
1	the place is old and outdated , and the restrooms were horrible .	1	1
1	my dinner there was a substantial miss for a pretty substantial price .	1	1
1	well _num_ turned into _num_ .	1	1
1	the only nice thing about this place is the ambiance .	1	1
1	it was n't me .	1	1
1	sorry to say , restaurant is riding on its former reputation .	1	1
1	but then i had to wait more than _num_ minutes to get my food .	1	1
1	they , again , were not cooked to medium ... overcooked to medium well .	1	1
1	bad service !	1	1
1	i will never go back though .	1	1
1	this place should be like $ _num_ a night .	1	1
1	they did n't even paint the roof .	1	1
1	boxes and toys were all over the floor in the store .	1	1
1	skip it .	1	1
1	it was around $ _num_ .	1	1
1	_num_ ) the lemonade is _num_ % ice !	1	1
1	went in to have a slow leak fixed on a tire .	1	1
1	after receiving my food i walked back to my hotel to enjoy some bbq .	1	1
1	turns out they do n't have soup .	1	1
1	i mean , we went here thinking we would get a good value .	1	1
1	i would give this restaurant _num_ stars if i could .	1	1
1	boo , bad customer service and not worth the food .	1	1
1	so unfortunately , i did n't enjoy majority of my reception .	1	1
1	i talked to the waitress and she offered to bring out another side .	1	1
1	the smell of urine when you walk in is overwhelming .	1	1
1	the staff is very rude .	1	1
1	_num_ of _num_ of our steaks came out totally wrong .	1	1
1	truly the worst customer experience ever .	1	1
1	it fell apart and had bones in it .	1	1
1	no refills on coffee , and the food was nowhere as good as previously .	1	1
1	what animal hospital does not stock those items ?	1	1
1	stay away from sales person kevin .	1	1
1	the sandwiches were fine and were inexpensive .	1	1
1	dirty floor , cardboard pizza .	1	1
1	i 'm really torn by this review .	1	1
1	the overall experience seemed somewhat disappointing .	1	1
1	wrong .	1	1
1	do n't understand the hype .	1	1
1	i had the chicken flatbread and the chicken was more like subway chicken !	1	1
1	she had to check with kitchen several times to answer our questions .	1	1
1	so bad service .	1	1
1	i wo n't be back .	1	1
1	the menu says there 's a charge for fried rice instead of white .	1	1
1	bug problem .	1	1
1	i ordered the spiced pear drink and it was terrible .	1	1
1	the sandwich itself was mediocre .	1	1
1	do n't get married here .	1	1
1	most likely will not return .	1	1
1	i did n't leave a tip for probably the second time in my life .	1	1
1	the wait staff leaves a lot to be desired , the hosts are great .	1	1
1	it 's really frustrating .	1	1
1	the current tenant informed me that the roof leaked .	1	1
1	im never going back .	1	1
1	the veggies were the only high spot .	1	1
1	i wo n't be back .	1	1
1	i wan na love bar louie , i do .	1	1
1	i pretty much hate this hotel .	1	1
1	what i learned ... do n't trust the stars , read the reviews .	1	1
1	a little more pricey but it caught my eye .	1	1
1	the front desk staff is the worst i 've ever encountered .	1	1
1	after looking online , i 'm fairly certain that was just plain wrong .	1	1
1	this is not the first time either .	1	1
1	finally - a halfway decent tv setup , pittsburgh !	1	1
1	i had to pay $ _num_ to add cheese to the hoagie .	1	1
1	i was n't paying for a meal twice and getting attitude from this guy .	1	1
1	this was just bad pizza .	1	1
1	that has never happened in our household .	1	1
1	she showed me two options and i chose one .	1	1
1	just plain gross .	1	1
1	it seems that this is a common experience at this restaurant .	1	1
1	... no wonder .	1	1
1	( _num_ ) lack of amenities .	1	1
1	i immediately notified the staff and was told the manager would be notified .	1	1
1	that is the last money i will spend in that place .	1	1
1	when i got the food it was cold and i was so disappointed .	1	1
1	the waitress just was too young and inexperienced .	1	1
1	we love japanese steak houses and this was our least favorite meal in pittsburgh .	1	1
1	the place was n't too crowded for a lunch hour so that was nice .	1	1
1	if i could less than a star i would .	1	1
1	it is not worth it .	1	1
1	the employees are rude , particularly scott who works in the plant section .	1	1
1	there was nothing memorable about the taste of it whatsoever .	1	1
1	_num_ minutes later , nothing .	1	1
1	too pricey for the quality .	1	1
1	have n't had this bad of an experience in a while .	1	1
1	do not trust this days in .	1	1
1	not very good chinese food here .	1	1
1	my steak was not cooked to the right temperature - well vs medium well .	1	1
1	_num_ stars .	1	1
1	maybe that 's for atmosphere , but it was not enjoyable .	1	1
1	if you are looking for customer service , look elsewhere .	1	1
1	they did n't care that the flights were all delayed by _num_ hours .	1	1
1	it was cold .	1	1
1	manager did not even offer to comp my _num_ hour stay either !	1	1
1	glad they have plenty of shorts to buy when its _num_ degrees outside .	1	1
1	they just do n't run a very professional operation .	1	1
1	so , this looks like a three star review .	1	1
1	lack of professionalism with the management staff .	1	1
1	so disappointed ... .	1	1
1	this additional charge should have been mentioned on the menu .	1	1
1	it was n't spoiled tasting , more like a really cheap cut of meat .	1	1
1	never notified me , never called nothing .	1	1
1	there was nothing to dip my celery in .	1	1
1	i have no idea why it ever left the kitchen .	1	1
1	but did nothing to make up for it .	1	1
1	she laid it down and walked off .	1	1
1	_num_ employees confirmed no more waters in back .	1	1
1	waitresses do not make much of an effort .	1	1
1	so i asked how to return it and he did n't know .	1	1
1	deserts were nothing less than stellar , and the service was awesome .	1	1
1	everything else was sub-par .	1	1
1	summary : very noisy , terrible service .	1	1
1	it pains me to write this review !	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	checked in to a room on the 6th floor ( out of _num_ ) .	1	1
1	they were all crisp , no potato , and no flavor .	1	1
1	the chips were all broken and stale .	1	1
1	its not like she got nothing out of it !	1	1
1	the miso soup was barely average .	1	1
1	the line was over three hours long .	1	1
1	she poured me a _num_ oz pour and charged me around $ _num_ .	1	1
1	we sadly left with extreme disappointment !	1	1
1	they may ask you where the food came from ?	1	1
1	horrible service .	1	1
1	otherwise , i do n't think i 'll order from there again .	1	1
1	thankfully i just dislike tomatoes and it was n't an allergy issue .	1	1
1	the decor was pretty nice but the food left alot to be desired .	1	1
1	server was prompt getting to the table , took our order and then disappeared .	1	1
1	food was only just ok and service was even worse .	1	1
1	i wish i could give them _num_ stars ... total waste of money .	1	1
1	half the time you do n't understand what they speak in english .	1	1
1	i want to like this place , but just ca n't .	1	1
1	waste of time .	1	1
1	_num_ others in same situation .	1	1
1	the service was terrible , took _num_ min to get a water .	1	1
1	she disappeared for about _num_ minutes before returning .	1	1
1	when i want to cook pretentious gourmet food , they have every ingredient ready .	1	1
1	for $ _num_ that is a rip off , a joke and unacceptable !	1	1
1	i did not leave a tip .	1	1
1	my wife had a chicken special .	1	1
1	i 'm sure the room service would have been better .	1	1
1	i was n't too impressed with my visit here .	1	1
1	lobster roll was dry and salty .	1	1
1	minimal meat and a ton of shredded lettuce .	1	1
1	the tempura , i had no taste for it .	1	1
1	i have not met anyone there with a personality yet .	1	1
1	poor management and extremely poor customer service !	1	1
1	i unfortunately ordered the fettuccine alfredo -- worst ever .	1	1
1	our waitress was also terrible .	1	1
1	their policy is `` no teams '' .	1	1
1	medium cup of tomato soup : $ _num_ do n't expect a roll .	1	1
1	however , lots of seats since the place was empty .	1	1
1	i was disappointed when my next piece was also quite fatty .	1	1
1	there are better hibachi options in the area .	1	1
1	our server was nice , but not attentive at all .	1	1
1	i just ca n't imagine having to deal with this a year .	1	1
1	what a disappointment !	1	1
1	last time we were there the server was horrendous as well .	1	1
1	we ordered two seafood entrees , two beers , and an order of sushi .	1	1
1	disappointing experience after almost a year since the last time i was here .	1	1
1	ugh .	1	1
1	the tv is outdated and old .	1	1
1	after ordering from here my credit card number was stolen .	1	1
1	the service was mediocre .	1	1
1	_num_ stars .	1	1
1	he does not know everything .	1	1
1	awful place with rude people .	1	1
1	worst wifi of any airport !	1	1
1	i just do n't get how anyone could like it ?	1	1
1	my rating used to be four stars , yes that 's four stars .	1	1
1	_num_ minutes later our appetizer comes out .	1	1
1	with all of the fabulous choices in the south hills , pick another destination .	1	1
1	that is where the efficiency and service took a turn for the worst .	1	1
1	um , this airport sucks , okay ?	1	1
1	extremely low quality chicken on the orange chicken .	1	1
1	go to domino 's if this is your papa johns for your area .	1	1
1	just chunks of tomato .	1	1
1	this is the worst wendy 's i 've been too !	1	1
1	no sign of italian meat to be found .	1	1
1	i dont know , i do n't care .	1	1
1	we were really disappointed in this hotel and will not be returning at all .	1	1
1	i waited for a while before i called back and there was no answer .	1	1
1	i ordered the cheese ravioli and added two meatballs .	1	1
1	my biggest gripe , though , would be the overcooked scallops .	1	1
1	rooms were clean and the amenities were fine .	1	1
1	the ac barely works .	1	1
1	worst lunch option uptown .	1	1
1	how this place has _num_ stars i do not understand .	1	1
1	sorry , but i just do n't get it .	1	1
1	there was not one thing that i would even recommend to anyone .	1	1
1	the customers and the staff are miserable at red white and blue .	1	1
1	i bought tickets online _num_ days prior to the show .	1	1
1	we probably wo n't be coming back to this location .	1	1
1	the food did n't taste right .	1	1
1	horrible customer service , i will never spend another dime in this dive !	1	1
1	not a good idea .	1	1
1	this is the `` service '' industry and you missed the mark tonight .	1	1
1	back and forth a total waste of time .	1	1
1	i ordered two double cheeseburgers and waited over twenty minutes for them .	1	1
1	i have zero problem moving over in order to allow faster drivers to pass .	1	1
1	there are about _num_ seating options , _num_ were used all the others empty .	1	1
1	that 's not a lobster roll !	1	1
1	the rating is a zero !	1	1
1	that was unacceptable .	1	1
1	also , very expensive !	1	1
1	there were other customers of hertz with the same situation as well .	1	1
1	food was terrible and woman who rang me up was soooooo rude .	1	1
1	this is not japanese food , period .	1	1
1	it is all watered down and gross .	1	1
1	however , the food quality simply does n't warrant the cost .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	i would never patronize a place like this .	1	1
1	like no extra dishes , no splitting anything , etc .	1	1
1	pricey and does n't live up to it at all .	1	1
1	this is not a place that a neighborhood should support .	1	1
1	only had a bite of that and threw it away .	1	1
1	was she having a bad day ?	1	1
1	also , i wrote to the restaurant and received no response .	1	1
1	bad bad service .	1	1
1	two of us were there early and rudely treated by the hostess .	1	1
1	rules made by men .	1	1
1	it 's just a numbers thing at this point .	1	1
1	we walked in and waited to be sat .	1	1
1	some of the worst chinese take out i 've had in a long time .	1	1
1	never again will i rent from them .	1	1
1	the clientele , for some reason , really made for a loud dining experience .	1	1
1	worst hotel i 've stayed at in years .	1	1
1	also the ambiance of anthony 's is not the same .	1	1
1	cole saw sucked , it was soggy lettuce smothered in warm mayonnaise .	1	1
1	needless to say i am extremely displeased with my services here .	1	1
1	she damaged my hair so badly i ended up having _num_ inches cut off .	1	1
1	do not live here .	1	1
1	eggs , green beans , mac and cheese were all above par .	1	1
1	i paid _num_ $ all together and it should have been free .	1	1
1	first off , i sat in the sushi bar area .	1	1
1	i had one of my worst dining experiences here ever .	1	1
1	it is very isolated with not much within walking distance .	1	1
1	first impression : the place is old and in need of some updates .	1	1
1	taste like noodles , salt , and water .	1	1
1	and the one sit down restaurant that is open has no outlets .	1	1
1	missed my flight and this was the cheapest option .	1	1
1	i stopped at the local stores the whole time i 'm in nc .	1	1
1	it was $ _num_ a piece for my wife and i to get in .	1	1
1	the crust was super doughy and the cheese was pretty gross .	1	1
1	i go once or twice a week roughly , but never again .	1	1
1	i chose your fried steak with green and salad to go .	1	1
1	i chose the fiesta chicken chopped salad and new chicken tortilla soup .	1	1
1	Neutral	1	1
1	apparently they feel that frozen cakes are acceptable for events .	1	1
1	the times i 've been here , its been an ok experience .	1	1
1	not laid out well .	1	1
1	typical fast chinese food .	1	1
1	future actions : will not come again for sure !	1	1
1	nothing about the menu items say louisiana or french quarter .	1	1
1	unbelievable that they 're still in business .	1	1
1	perhaps next time we 'll just stop by for drinks instead .	1	1
1	not quite sure what the target market is for this place .	1	1
1	it 's not that hard .	1	1
1	while the food remains okay , the service leaves something to be desired .	1	1
1	i could make better alfredo using the sauce from a supermarket jar .	1	1
1	this pizza is mediocre at best .	1	1
1	i called the manager over , to let them know the situation .	1	1
1	the refried beans was like sauce .	1	1
1	of course nothing happened on monday .	1	1
1	the beer specials and _num_ .	1	1
1	the duck was really rough & fatty .	1	1
1	the owner was rude and did not even apologize for the horrible service .	1	1
1	ppl have been waiting _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	how can i describe my experience here ?	1	1
1	horrible treatment .	1	1
1	i would give this place half a star if i could .	1	1
1	drove locally around charlotte for two days and used about 1/4 tank .	1	1
1	i was confused asked to speak tho the manager by another waitress .	1	1
1	the service was friendly and the beer is cold .	1	1
1	wow , only in charlotte would you find a chain restaurant bar crawl .	1	1
1	finally i had enough and walked out .	1	1
1	why does the food taste weird ?	1	1
1	the gun shot great , unfortunately the staff and facilities were well below par .	1	1
1	no frills .	1	1
1	do not order steak or prime rib here .	1	1
1	still looking for a good chinese food place here in charlotte wish me luck !	1	1
1	not very tasty .	1	1
1	not my favorite .	1	1
1	to any new potential new customer out there , please be warned .	1	1
1	establishment was not busy at all , decided to seat ourselves at the bar .	1	1
1	you 're probably asking why order that when at a fish market .	1	1
1	it was n't overly crowded which made it easy to get drinks .	1	1
1	it does n't make sense .	1	1
1	the flavor was meh and the black truffle butter was surprisingly boring .	1	1
1	i refused .	1	1
1	so turned off by this club .	1	1
1	the store never looks very clean .	1	1
1	not enough gooey cheesy saucy mess .	1	1
1	i was then transferred to housekeeping where i was constantly sent to a voicemail .	1	1
1	but it was seriously bad .	1	1
1	i even asked for low salt , low sugar , and low msg .	1	1
1	the food looks like my patients vomit .	1	1
1	i do n't have time for this , i 'm very busy '' .	1	1
1	this is not the way to treat potential customers and just people in general .	1	1
1	this place is soon so gross .	1	1
1	i want to know what to expect , you know ?	1	1
1	marinara sauce over spaghetti was far too sweet .	1	1
1	it was hard to find `` tomatoes '' in the dish .	1	1
1	no pizza , no call .	1	1
1	this is why i chose them to begin with as stated about .	1	1
1	as for the food .	1	1
1	things have really slipped since then though .	1	1
1	i guess she figured we were new and did n't know any better .	1	1
1	horrible .	1	1
1	i would not suggest this bar to anyone .	1	1
1	literally the worst steak i 've had in a year or two .	1	1
1	had a _num_ am appointment and was told it would be a hour wait .	1	1
1	this level of noise makes sleep difficult .	1	1
1	it just was n't as authentic as i was hoping for .	1	1
1	i thought the menu had said tapas style for the table - my bad .	1	1
1	since the changes its just awful .	1	1
1	the drive-thru workers are rude and they give you crap food .	1	1
1	it made me worry what smell they were trying to cover up .	1	1
1	quite frankly they were disgusting .	1	1
1	i did n't think it was that good .	1	1
1	the service is the worst i 've ever seen .	1	1
1	this hotel is billed on-line as a _num_ star hotel .	1	1
1	we will not be back .	1	1
1	none of the items were cooked properly .	1	1
1	they drowned my salad in ranch dressing and cheese ... .	1	1
1	i stand by my decision : pass .	1	1
1	she left her other co-worker to handle the entire crowd .	1	1
1	do n't waste your time ... .	1	1
1	far too much cream and cheese .	1	1
1	throughout the entire order , we got nothing but attitude .	1	1
1	small portions and pricey lunch .	1	1
1	i will say i still ate them so shame on me .	1	1
1	cold cold cold .	1	1
1	crab rangoon is soggy .	1	1
1	finally , we felt like the whole restaurant clientele has declined .	1	1
1	i 'm _num_ and i almost felt too old there .	1	1
1	then it was loud , due to people , and the bartenders .	1	1
1	both tasted very fishy to me .	1	1
1	the bald manager is not a very nice person also .	1	1
1	the rolls were extremely bland and chewy .	1	1
1	it 's a museum , not a zoo after all .	1	1
1	please do not support a place that sells puppy mill dogs .	1	1
1	wake up or you are going to lose your business .	1	1
1	because you could n't fit me in within a day i get screwed ?	1	1
1	i looked at my boyfriend who checked his watch while i checked my iphone .	1	1
1	i 've given it _num_ chances , and they all sucked .	1	1
1	staff was supposed to help with a reservation and dropped the ball .	1	1
1	they do n't clean urine off the toilet seats .	1	1
1	it is not near the top of my favorites .	1	1
1	do n't waste your time .	1	1
1	also a heads up - only _num_ pedicure chairs in the place .	1	1
1	update ... shadyside inn refunded the charges from our stay .	1	1
1	i was advised by maria that they will come from italy .	1	1
1	i 'm always always always made to feel like i 'm stupid ( seriously ?	1	1
1	it 's sad when a park can only give you a drink for compensation .	1	1
1	our waitress was hit or miss and we waited awhile for the bill .	1	1
1	you do n't get to see the room .	1	1
1	still , i think there are newer hotels that provide the same .	1	1
1	i 'm not sure if i 'll go back to thai house .	1	1
1	same exact job but also including a new hose cost me $ _num_ .	1	1
1	they also run out of sweet tea a lot .	1	1
1	unfortunately the order was sent to flower hut .	1	1
1	- lots of food choices ... burgers ... steak ... chicken ... salads .	1	1
1	we booked a total of _num_ rooms with them and checked in individually .	1	1
1	how ironic !	1	1
1	the mac and cheese was okay , but oddly a bit bland .	1	1
1	this pizza hut is quite possibly the worst service i have ever received .	1	1
1	the service was pitiful !	1	1
1	this is a personal experience that stuck with me for years .	1	1
1	lamb chops and shrimp pasta were just ok.	1	1
1	this hotel is stuck in the middle of nowhere .	1	1
1	during the wedding , all i saw was how things were going wrong .	1	1
1	they have the worst transportation service ever in pittsburgh .	1	1
1	in my opinion , the is a prime example of a bad shadyside bar .	1	1
1	did n't really make anything i could n't make at home .	1	1
1	it 's not sanitary .	1	1
1	i called to complain and they hung up on me .	1	1
1	shortly after , another lady comes over .	1	1
1	the cable and internet did not work our first night there .	1	1
1	then when i got it , it was cold !	1	1
1	neither of our messages were returned .	1	1
1	d. reception desk : lack of a sense of urgency plus no follow-up .	1	1
1	fine ... no big deal , i got to use my coupon .	1	1
1	_num_ ) the private room was great but never warmed up .	1	1
1	do not waste your time and money at this restaurant .	1	1
1	the entire place was just filthy !	1	1
1	wo n't come again to this place ... .	1	1
1	excuse me ?	1	1
1	the receptionist can not handle tips at all .	1	1
1	with grilled veggies and mashed potatoes .	1	1
1	unfortunately , they were very disappointing .	1	1
1	we got the scallop appetizer and it was to die for !	1	1
1	none of the three ever tried to assist .	1	1
1	we were disappointed in this hotel .	1	1
1	interior could use an update .	1	1
1	definitely has the local irish bar feel to it .	1	1
1	extremely slow !	1	1
1	she was sick six ways to sunday .	1	1
1	i was a customer , and my car got towed .	1	1
1	the towel the girl put out had large brown stains on it !	1	1
1	moderately busy , but seated right away .	1	1
1	we had a horrible experience here last summer .	1	1
1	this location is no exception to that rule .	1	1
1	two of those came wrong again .	1	1
1	i asked for a refund and left immediately .	1	1
1	huge waste of a layover .	1	1
1	i 'm still waiting to find out what ate me up !	1	1
1	if i could give this place zero stars i would .	1	1
1	i think she got _num_ out of every _num_ drink orders correct .	1	1
1	they also tend to forget some essential ( i.e .	1	1
1	nothing had improved .	1	1
1	_num_ tries , _num_ mins each time .	1	1
1	every vet i 've been to takes the temp through her ear .	1	1
1	it did not taste authentic .	1	1
1	pricing is horrendous for beers .	1	1
1	this is the worst sushi place in charlotte .	1	1
1	trust the reviews , it 's not worth the wait or the money !	1	1
1	our food took forever and when it got there i was highly disappointed .	1	1
1	the food was very disappointing .	1	1
1	the vet met with us for a very short amount of time .	1	1
1	please ... .	1	1
1	avoid the buffalo chicken , just get the plain .	1	1
1	interior is dark and dated .	1	1
1	shrimp on top was nice but no lobster filling .	1	1
1	why ca n't employees act kind to those who are dining in their home ?	1	1
1	i thought the charges were excessive and questionable services that they stated i needed .	1	1
1	not a fan .	1	1
1	crappy service and food .	1	1
1	two hours later , i called and left another voice mail .	1	1
1	do n't know what that meant ; did they run out of spinach ?	1	1
1	wo n't make the _num_ hour drive again from charleston .	1	1
1	the pillows were appalling and there was no complimentary breakfast and no refrigerator .	1	1
1	okay thai food , nothing special , and overpriced .	1	1
1	i wo n't be back .	1	1
1	worst food in pittsburgh .	1	1
1	every time i have been to cafe sam i have been very disappointed .	1	1
1	dude - here 's a tip - do n't ask for a tip .	1	1
1	this was not nearly as good .	1	1
1	friday night is apparently not the night to go .	1	1
1	it was accompanied by some typical frozen steak fries .	1	1
1	the salad was made with iceberg lettuce and did n't look appetizing .	1	1
1	not a fan at all .	1	1
1	the penne ala vodka was sauteed canned tomatoes and no flavor .	1	1
1	the filling in the middle had a bland taste , nothing special about it .	1	1
1	will not go again .	1	1
1	probably the worst i 've ever had .	1	1
1	im sorry .	1	1
1	at this point , one star is being generous .	1	1
1	if i were to go back , it certainly would not be to eat .	1	1
1	like i said maybe just an off night but we wo n't be back .	1	1
1	not cool .	1	1
1	( $ _num_ + $ _num_ ) .	1	1
1	tastes plain & over cooked .	1	1
1	wise guys is your typical off beat pizza shop .	1	1
1	went here a night during final four ( basket ball ) .	1	1
1	after i ordered , the waiter came back twice .	1	1
1	yet again , not one courtesy call , nothing resolved .	1	1
1	worst arby 's in the planet .	1	1
1	it really is a pittsburgh staple but come on ... .	1	1
1	it was a small side salad of iceberg lettuce and croutons with italian dressing .	1	1
1	there were dirty plates and cups everywhere .	1	1
1	was n't very busy which was a plus .	1	1
1	just a poor , poor experience at this location overall .	1	1
1	sadly , they prepared kung pao beef instead .	1	1
1	i had the shrimp and grits and it was ... not good .	1	1
1	and thus my rating of meh .	1	1
1	just said to try back again !	1	1
1	for _num_ girlfriends , they brought _num_ joint check .	1	1
1	curry fried rice was also bland , luckily we have sriracha at home .	1	1
1	the meat were tasteless and dry and so were the veggies !	1	1
1	nothing more ; nothing less .	1	1
1	but wait , it gets worse .	1	1
1	by the time we ordered , there were _num_ other people behind us .	1	1
1	i do not recommend .	1	1
1	park was beyond rude and unhelpful about it .	1	1
1	this is the place for wan na be steelers fans .	1	1
1	get your shit together .	1	1
1	i also ordered provolone sticks which also did not taste good .	1	1
1	but their repeated attempts to enter woke us up .	1	1
1	okay so the app was meh , main entrees yay !	1	1
1	stick to a boutique if you want real customer service .	1	1
1	probably should have gotten a salad .	1	1
1	the bun came out soggy and the sandwich did not hold very well together .	1	1
1	eventually one of them fell ... .	1	1
1	i would hire any number of them at any time .	1	1
1	the food is also terrible and overpriced .	1	1
1	ugh .	1	1
1	the biggest rip-off ever .	1	1
1	customer service is awful i wo n't be eating here ever again !	1	1
1	so why my low score ?	1	1
1	the cheese was loaded on the top with almost no crab flavor .	1	1
1	was n't even nice enough to bring them to me .	1	1
1	the bar food is typical .	1	1
1	like i said , olive garden , only local .	1	1
1	our food is always wrong .	1	1
1	and it seems like everybody that goes in there are trashy and rude .	1	1
1	there are far better mexican restaurants in charlotte .	1	1
1	it 's awful and we wo n't be going back .	1	1
1	what an insult .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	it 's almost been _num_ hours and i 'm still waiting .	1	1
1	getting on and off is confusing .	1	1
1	having worked in the rental business i knew she was n't telling the truth .	1	1
1	they need to get out of the _num_ 's with the decor .	1	1
1	bad idea .	1	1
1	when they paid for my stuff the girl pretty much threw my money down .	1	1
1	false advertising at its best -- should n't that be illegal ?	1	1
1	because there regular food is mall grade at best .	1	1
1	i managed one bite and was done .	1	1
1	the rice tasted like a flavorless mush with chewy `` pork '' .	1	1
1	the most disappointing were the pita and the gyro meat .	1	1
1	and their garlic dressing is disgusting .	1	1
1	ignoring the fact that i was unhappy and i did n't like it .	1	1
1	the atmosphere is nice but the food quality was lacking .	1	1
1	will not be going back .	1	1
1	ca n't mess that up right ?	1	1
1	we started off with two appetizers : calamari and crab dip .	1	1
1	nonetheless , filing taxes is a necessary evil .	1	1
1	it almost looked like boiled ground beef .	1	1
1	_num_ ) they use canned whipped cream .	1	1
1	i talked to him for _num_ minutes and he was polite and friendly .	1	1
1	but the positives stop there .	1	1
1	the fish was edible , but there is way better fish fry out there .	1	1
1	this place is beautiful but not worth the money , stress , or headache .	1	1
1	ugh .	1	1
1	too bad the man who answers the phone was rude as all heck .	1	1
1	from that point on , our experience was unbelievably bad .	1	1
1	it does n't change much .	1	1
1	however , it was absolutely nothing special .	1	1
1	do not go here , it 's an utter disgrace .	1	1
1	grab any car in the lane and drive away .	1	1
1	if not , stay away .	1	1
1	panera bread has to be the most inconsistent restaurant i have ever been to .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	i really feel sorry for those who continue to buy from here .	1	1
1	i did n't like it .	1	1
1	very classy , wish i could remember her name .	1	1
1	stopped by fiori 's , have n't been there in years .	1	1
1	`` no , it 's not ready yet .	1	1
1	do not get married here !	1	1
1	service was ok but occasionally inattentive .	1	1
1	um ... no !	1	1
1	horrible .	1	1
1	i gave it a try and i was really disappointed .	1	1
1	this place is the worst , and i have never even stepped inside !	1	1
1	the whole call took _num_ minutes most of it on hold .	1	1
1	does n't anyone come and check this ?	1	1
1	ugh .	1	1
1	they had no idea how long it would take .	1	1
1	bland reheated samosas .	1	1
1	staff appears confused regularly .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	he was very rude to us .	1	1
1	in its current state , i would not recommend it .	1	1
1	but each time i come away disappointed , even more than last time .	1	1
1	went for brunch and spent $ _num_ .	1	1
1	it looked horrible .	1	1
1	it happens !	1	1
1	( i was _num_ cars away ) .	1	1
1	no one called , no apologies .	1	1
1	it was another _num_ before i got my food .	1	1
1	overall not impressed .	1	1
1	run away from this property as quickly as possible !	1	1
1	you ca n't mess it up ) .	1	1
1	cost was $ _num_ .	1	1
1	will not return and i do n't recommend you waste your money here .	1	1
1	the food was underwhelming at best .	1	1
1	this is one of the worst experiences i have had at a restaurant .	1	1
1	pretentious and overpriced .	1	1
1	did n't bring my refill receipts and got charged _num_ .	1	1
1	when i went in to discuss , i heard another patient checking in .	1	1
1	first mistake .	1	1
1	the worst mcdonald 's i have ever experienced .	1	1
1	they really need to pull some tables out of there to make more room .	1	1
1	i called a bit late and they only had _num_ pm open .	1	1
1	the wait staff had to be reminded several times of what we ordered .	1	1
1	i mean , this could cost me for a long time .	1	1
1	rode my bike out to meet my old man .	1	1
1	it is not worth the time or money .	1	1
1	their orange juice is never too tart , never too sweet .	1	1
1	it was just okay nothing special at all !	1	1
1	the service manager is not an individual i feel that i can trust !	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	this is not one of them .	1	1
1	the weekdays are bad enough .	1	1
1	mixed in with this were some dried herbs - maybe an italian mix ?	1	1
1	so i went back first thing the next day , and showed the tailor .	1	1
1	it 's extremely frustrating .	1	1
1	the chicken wings were delivered nice and hot , crispy but lacking in flavor .	1	1
1	- it 's _num_ and they have no website or menu .	1	1
1	it 's an ayce trio .	1	1
1	i wish someone had informed the port authority of this .	1	1
1	this place was trashy , dirty and probably not even up to code .	1	1
1	they were apologetic when they finally realized my meal was n't touched .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	yelp as well as the online website said they close at _num_ .	1	1
1	mushy spaghetti drenched in the worst sauce i ever had .	1	1
1	the food is n't something to rave about but it 's edible .	1	1
1	from my first bite it was missing something ... flavor .	1	1
1	no ... these bagels are about the same you would get anywhere .	1	1
1	i would n't even have cooked this way for an enemy .	1	1
1	the room was not very nice .	1	1
1	a little pricy for food but not too bad .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	the salad was just alright , nothing terribly impressive .	1	1
1	i 'm still trying to figure out how one manages to burn noodles .	1	1
1	this is the most outdated and dingy major city airport i 've ever seen .	1	1
1	they just broke into my house without any notice to show around .	1	1
1	i 'm actually sorry i ever even ate there .	1	1
1	the bill was way too high .	1	1
1	service was slow but they were nice about it .	1	1
1	i get alright service sometimes , then terrible at other times .	1	1
1	went in there with friends knowing `` friends '' but everyone was rude .	1	1
1	this particular location has really let me down !	1	1
1	the bread was the worst part .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	i had to throw it in the microwave because it was no longer hot .	1	1
1	however , there were three hostesses at the bar chatting and seemingly doing nothing .	1	1
1	the absolute worst service i have ever had at any bar or restaraunt .	1	1
1	menu description is poor though .	1	1
1	i now know why this place is always empty .	1	1
1	i have no need to do that .	1	1
1	it reminded me of a cheap college place .	1	1
1	the menu was pretty random and everything we tried was really average .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	bbq was disgusting and swimming in grease .	1	1
1	i ordered a shrimp and veggie stir fry to go .	1	1
1	i would not bring a spider there .	1	1
1	however , food wise , it was just ok and a bit disappointing .	1	1
1	clt is begging for a major renovation !	1	1
1	over _num_ hours after they say it 'll be ready .	1	1
1	maybe i chose poorly but i was n't impressed at all .	1	1
1	my first & second experience here were both the same -- horrible .	1	1
1	and just leave this one alone .	1	1
1	not impressed , left hungry .	1	1
1	the visit i made on my birthday jan _num_ , was the absolute worst .	1	1
1	i got a medium _num_ topping and this pizza was very bland to me .	1	1
1	so go thee instead .	1	1
1	it just sucks here .	1	1
1	my boyfriend ordered the hot fish , but it was way too salty .	1	1
1	oh , and its very very expensive !	1	1
1	either the batteries are almost dead or its just terrible .	1	1
1	cutting too many corners .	1	1
1	what is really bad is the food was horrible !	1	1
1	ca n't comment on food since i was just in for beers .	1	1
1	wow just really bad .	1	1
1	this was our first visit to this restaurant .	1	1
1	if you sign a lease now it 's $ _num_ .	1	1
1	do n't waste your money or time .	1	1
1	if i could give this place zero stars i would .	1	1
1	the vibe felt kind of lame , it was n't for me .	1	1
1	so not worth it .	1	1
1	how do places keep getting good reviews when they are so bad .	1	1
1	it 's spacious and they have outdoor seating and open windows .	1	1
1	i wo n't be going back .	1	1
1	endless apps were over _num_ mins apart from the kitchen .	1	1
1	service could have been better .	1	1
1	much better value for money spent .	1	1
1	am i still expected to keep waiting ?	1	1
1	stay away , there 's nothing here to see .	1	1
1	there 's no restaurant outside security except a starbucks .	1	1
1	either my tastes have improved or the quality has gone downhill .	1	1
1	decent furniture but wow was i disappointed by the payment process .	1	1
1	they ripped me off .	1	1
1	apparently they do n't have a lot of confidence that their prices are competitive .	1	1
1	no he did n't !	1	1
1	then the egg roll was soggy .	1	1
1	when we got to the table , we were hoping for a better experience .	1	1
1	it 's sad to me that someone would open a coffee shop like this .	1	1
1	terrible .	1	1
1	avoid this place at all costs !	1	1
1	last i had the vegetarian curry dish , the only vegetarian main i found .	1	1
1	this store is not customer service friendly .	1	1
1	strike _num_ .	1	1
1	food : sub-par for your money .	1	1
1	the bed was comfortable enough and the room was mostly clean .	1	1
1	when i called him out , he proceeded to get loud and walked away !	1	1
1	nasty !	1	1
1	( _num_ ) i called multiple times but could n't reach anyone .	1	1
1	i fall into the later category : i did n't like it at all .	1	1
1	waited for _num_ minutes for a bagel with cream cheese with no line .	1	1
1	the food is crap .	1	1
1	tasted like sauce and cheese on toast .	1	1
1	walk-in customers will be treated with less effort than existing customers .	1	1
1	very quick but kinda confusing to find the place .	1	1
1	in philly , they 'd be out of business in a heartbeat .	1	1
1	so it was no discount at all .	1	1
1	considering the size of pittsburgh , the bus system here is actually pathetic .	1	1
1	order : big mac , large fries , diet coke .	1	1
1	but this was our first visit , and we wo n't be back .	1	1
1	tonight was the worst experience we have had for a very long time .	1	1
1	we both threw down a brew nasty , paid and left .	1	1
1	this is the worst customer service i 've ever had at a starbucks .	1	1
1	overall the experience was unpleasant , i 've been to much better airports .	1	1
1	the food was ok but it 's not memorable .	1	1
1	it 's either just decent , or just plain bad .	1	1
1	i could n't check out of that hotel fast enough .	1	1
1	well , my update has half of my original rating .	1	1
1	is n't the rule `` customer is always right '' ?	1	1
1	very forgettable .	1	1
1	the location and staff gives off bad vibes .	1	1
1	who on earth could possibly find this place worth returning to ?	1	1
1	stop apologizing and fix the problem !	1	1
1	maybe a warning sign .	1	1
1	they sent the original glasses off to be filled .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	sadly we were disappointed with our meal .	1	1
1	ingredients were n't fresh and the gyro was heavy on the spices .	1	1
1	also they had problems with their soda machine .	1	1
1	next time i 'll try morton 's or capital grille .	1	1
1	the shop is n't that great anyway .	1	1
1	and , insult to injury , my bloody mary was watered down .	1	1
1	first , they charge for beer and wine .	1	1
1	bland .	1	1
1	would not recommend !	1	1
1	the only plus to the restaurant was the servers .	1	1
1	your comments have been sent to our general manager , christopher beers .	1	1
1	should have listened to my gut on this one .	1	1
1	every order was lacking just that little something that would make a meal enjoyable .	1	1
1	she did n't listen at all .	1	1
1	which i do n't really need .	1	1
1	$ _num_ for _num_ '' italian and $ _num_ for _num_ '' mushroom steak .	1	1
1	that should have tipped me off .	1	1
1	the food was warm and nothing was heating it .	1	1
1	this is n't just for premium parking , but its for general too .	1	1
1	good for kids , bad for people who appreciate good japanese food .	1	1
1	she came back _num_ minutes later , with the beers and took our order .	1	1
1	alot of money for very poor care .	1	1
1	maybe my standards are too high .	1	1
1	no flavor or seasoning and the texture was reminiscent of spam .	1	1
1	i got the penne ala vodka without prosciutto because i do n't eat meat .	1	1
1	i know , you say , how can one possibly have too much cheese .	1	1
1	i asked the waitress ... did n't this come with the mango salsa topping ?	1	1
1	avoid !	1	1
1	this is by no means a must go to spot .	1	1
1	i visited around lunch time and the food was not that good .	1	1
1	c. incompetent `` maintenance '' personnel .	1	1
1	we waited fifteen or so minutes , the shots were consumed , etc .	1	1
1	i just want it right & this ordeal over !	1	1
1	so , to anyone reading this , i would look for another breakfast option .	1	1
1	the breakfast was weak .	1	1
1	na ... wo n't be back !	1	1
1	however , my father and i shared the porterhouse for two .	1	1
1	ordered _num_ gallon of sweet tea .	1	1
1	on top of that the cake was n't even fresh .	1	1
1	i wish there were zero stars .	1	1
1	then there 's the main restaurant that i really was n't that impressed with .	1	1
1	horrible !	1	1
1	i felt sick before i got halfway through it .	1	1
1	worst baggage claim area i 've ever experienced .	1	1
1	ugly dcor , bad food , poor service .	1	1
1	and was really disappointed .	1	1
1	from horrible service to terrible seafood ... would never return .	1	1
1	called this morning to check about the watch .	1	1
1	the worst tsa experience !	1	1
1	then , my brother got the prosciutto and arugula pizza .	1	1
1	the meat in both was slightly greasy and not particularly flavorful .	1	1
1	not exciting .	1	1
1	worst nail salon ever .	1	1
1	never again will i rent from this company .	1	1
1	worst hotel !	1	1
1	it is ridiculous !	1	1
1	_num_ minutes later , we were done .	1	1
1	and , apparently , delivery .	1	1
1	sat in a different seat and that seat did n't work as well .	1	1
1	their customer service is terrible .	1	1
1	however , i wo n't be back .	1	1
1	needless to say i did not get to .	1	1
1	we did n't realize most of the restaurants are closed on mondays .	1	1
1	the only thing i ever have to wait on are the free weights .	1	1
1	it just was n't a great environment .	1	1
1	_num_ the bread .	1	1
1	overly salted entree as well as very salty side of roasted mushrooms .	1	1
1	it looked like it went bad and they cooked it anyway .	1	1
1	my girlfriend is a vegetarian so one can imagine this ruined her dinner .	1	1
1	there was dust around the windows and possible old ketchup .	1	1
1	this appetizer reminded me of my mother 's irish cooking : tasteless .	1	1
1	slowest drive thru in the whole world .	1	1
1	last night i decided to give it another try and got crappy mozzarella sticks .	1	1
1	the ambiance is a little strange .	1	1
1	i ca n't rate it at zero stars ...	1	1
1	it was clear all she cared about was bringing me to the cleaners .	1	1
1	`` could be _num_ .	1	1
1	disappointment .	1	1
1	someone needs to wake up , update , and start cooking with passion .	1	1
1	ridiculous wait as they make us sit here waiting for returns to come in .	1	1
1	thee buffalo chicken sandwich had no lettuce or tomato on it .	1	1
1	if you want terrible pizza go here .	1	1
1	no wonder disney world is making a killing in this side of the woods !	1	1
1	we felt bad , and stuck around .	1	1
1	the staff was rude and poorly trained .	1	1
1	never going back .	1	1
1	i should n't have to ask for napkins at the point of need .	1	1
1	the bus number is _num_ .	1	1
1	did my irish name cause my order to be overly americanized ?	1	1
1	tonight we placed an order got home and half the order was wrong .	1	1
1	i just started laughing , i was sure this entire night was a joke .	1	1
1	this is `` name brand '' prices for crap clothing .	1	1
1	i 'd stay away from this garden like the plague , though .	1	1
1	it was flavorless and i had to add a ton of salt .	1	1
1	it did n't have a lot of flavor .	1	1
1	they probably knew we would n't have the money for a lawyer .	1	1
1	i just sat there for _num_ minutes while my party ate their food .	1	1
1	lidia should be ashamed that this is being run this way .	1	1
1	you might love this place but i had such a poor experience and follow-up .	1	1
1	the sandwiches , although unique , were not that good .	1	1
1	avoid !	1	1
1	i feel like the food is not flavorful and are always missing something .	1	1
1	unfortunately , went in for lunch today and had a similar experience with service .	1	1
1	when i say frequent , i mean every friday .	1	1
1	never ever whatsoever !	1	1
1	the management team of this mall would get negative stars if that was possible .	1	1
1	the scene reminds me of ... a garage .	1	1
1	none at all .	1	1
1	the drive through service here leaves something to be desired .	1	1
1	do they not make fresh brew coffee .	1	1
1	for dessert i had the apple pie cheesecake .	1	1
1	worst run business in the free world .	1	1
1	the server brought some cold , salty garlic rolls .	1	1
1	the slice of tomato that i had them add was not ripe .	1	1
1	the rice was some of the worst i have ever had .	1	1
1	fried chicken , macaroni and cheese and collards .	1	1
1	as bus stations go this one is pretty neat , tidy and clean .	1	1
1	i will look for a more hospitable hotel next time i 'm in charlotte .	1	1
1	however , it was very deceiving because the customer service was not good .	1	1
1	i will remember to never return while i 'm in pittsburgh .	1	1
1	worst us airport ever !	1	1
1	i do not recommend this dentist .	1	1
1	i ate two of the _num_ tenders ( seven ! )	1	1
1	she then rings me up .	1	1
1	for those that know me , i 'm not the gambling kind .	1	1
1	i thanked the jerk for his time and drove off .	1	1
1	unfortunately i heard after i ordered .	1	1
1	unfortunately , our experience was dreadful .	1	1
1	avoid at all costs if possible .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	i got the lobster roll and was really disappointed .	1	1
1	just getting our drinks out was confusing .	1	1
1	i gave her the benefit of the doubt & i completely regret it .	1	1
1	that 's $ _num_ for _num_ drinks .	1	1
1	i was forced to locate another vet when i adopted a new kitten .	1	1
1	she needs more training in customer service .	1	1
1	the salsa was ok ... not amazing but not bad .	1	1
1	she ( the employee ) left without paying her tab .	1	1
1	all in all this meal was just sad !	1	1
1	it took so long to get , we just left .	1	1
1	tonight i wanted to grab a quick brew before a yelp event .	1	1
1	the restaurant was busy , but was n't packed .	1	1
1	more screaming and yelling than the night before .	1	1
1	from the bakery , you walk along a long meat wall .	1	1
1	sorry to see this place go down hill .	1	1
1	called me a liar when i said the beer was stale .	1	1
1	the free breakfast is as bad as it gets .	1	1
1	they did the same service for $ _num_ .	1	1
1	he did not understand and said , no coupon .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	now , i 'm _num_ miles away and ca n't do anything about it .	1	1
1	the location also seemed a bit sketchy ; i 'd avoid this one .	1	1
1	the beef i got was so tough i could n't chew it .	1	1
1	can you give a company zero stars ?	1	1
1	it restaurants are over prices for a state that ends in carolina .	1	1
1	third sign i chose to ignore .	1	1
1	the bun was tasteless .	1	1
1	never been here before .	1	1
1	i 've been here a few times and have always been disappointed .	1	1
1	sure , it 's friday a busy night so an hour seemed reasonable .	1	1
1	your brand is being damaged because your staff does n't seem to care .	1	1
1	needless to say , the one hostess on duty never returned .	1	1
1	she asks employee to scale back .	1	1
1	generic , but what else do you expect from most downtown businesses .	1	1
1	very long wait .	1	1
1	it was around 11:30 and the restaurant was mostly empty .	1	1
1	the food is n't terrible , but not impressive .	1	1
1	i was a little dissatisfied in how poorly i welcomed to the hotel .	1	1
1	rip off .	1	1
1	you 've been warned !	1	1
1	that was not a real latte .	1	1
1	first , all of the food was extremely overpriced .	1	1
1	the light fixtures were too modern to be considered cozy .	1	1
1	ugh .	1	1
1	unbelievable .	1	1
1	my lunch companion had roast beef and regretted ordering anything .	1	1
1	i would try something else ... if i go back .	1	1
1	this service really sucks .	1	1
1	stopped by sunday morning .	1	1
1	i really want to like this place .	1	1
1	and i hate wasting food !	1	1
1	i 've walked in to make purchases .	1	1
1	i just have n't been impressed by anything i 've ordered there .	1	1
1	oh , and like _num_ slices of meat and a slice of cheese .	1	1
1	very inconvenient in a world where cash is pretty much on the way out .	1	1
1	i ca n't hold it against them though .	1	1
1	_num_ stars .	1	1
1	save yourself the trouble and just flush your money down the toilet !	1	1
1	i 'm very disappointed .	1	1
1	after a lengthy wait we ended up sitting at separate tables .	1	1
1	they were not that busy at all .	1	1
1	there are many places less expensive or where you get more for your money .	1	1
1	when we walked in the restaurant decor seems dated , or perhaps just generic .	1	1
1	however , they have let themselves go downhill .	1	1
1	apathetic service staff all around , the peanut and i were really disappointed .	1	1
1	the salad was just so-so .	1	1
1	so something weird to begin our visit ... .	1	1
1	it was more than once that i heard glass breaking .	1	1
1	they are officially on the back end of my list of best delis .	1	1
1	the nose was off , and so was the taste .	1	1
1	total for the above was $ _num_ !	1	1
1	it 's really sad actually .	1	1
1	overpriced and my muffin was stale .	1	1
1	too much to expect at a fast food joint .	1	1
1	the chicken was overly breaded and very soggy .	1	1
1	i want to know what fool made this decision .	1	1
1	i never really understood why doc 's was so popular .	1	1
1	bank of america at it again with less than exceptional customer service .	1	1
1	they deserve zero stars .	1	1
1	tough , clearly overcooked , and just downright horrible .	1	1
1	the music was too loud for conversation .	1	1
1	still no email quote .	1	1
1	this apple is too green to eat much less pay for .	1	1
1	the selection was not unique , though there were plenty of dresses .	1	1
1	for me , who was paying the bill ... not ok .	1	1
1	i wish i could review that lady on here .	1	1
1	she complained and the waitress brought out a side of broccoli .	1	1
1	i submitted a request online , a week went by and i heard nothing .	1	1
1	my air conditioning broke down a total of four times my stay here .	1	1
1	skip this .	1	1
1	very disappointing .	1	1
1	poor excuse for seafood !	1	1
1	we finally just walked out to go elsewhere .	1	1
1	thank god i only went bc i had a groupon .	1	1
1	but truth be told , i 'll probably be back .	1	1
1	no more .	1	1
1	his eggs were under cooked and the bacon was again , soggy .	1	1
1	food was lukewarm at best by the time it arrived .	1	1
1	dont get me wrong , i kinda like applebees .	1	1
1	most recently , i went here on a sunday for brunch with my family .	1	1
1	there 's a reason it cost that , because it was n't very good .	1	1
1	most of the staff were borderline rude or down right rude .	1	1
1	i think it is ridiculous that they say they need more clients !	1	1
1	do n't waste your time music out of date .	1	1
1	the wings came out wings , but lacked any sort of taste in it .	1	1
1	unfortunately , this is the only game in town .	1	1
1	i just want it right & this ordeal over !	1	1
1	i signed all paper work and returned the keys .	1	1
1	the steak was overcooked .	1	1
1	my husband and i stayed in pittsburgh for weeks and wanted to have pho .	1	1
1	there was no internet at the time .	1	1
1	the wedding soup was the worst i have ever had .	1	1
1	needless to say , i will not be back .	1	1
1	did not receive another paper until july 6th .	1	1
1	would not recommend until they work their production issues out .	1	1
1	at that time , i even had a terrible interaction with the owner .	1	1
1	i was mortified , my boyfriend was mortified , the waitress looked mortified .	1	1
1	i 'm not a hair stylist .	1	1
1	there is nothing worse than someone else 's hair in your food .	1	1
1	owners should know how they are being represented at the front register .	1	1
1	_num_ came and went and no shuttle .	1	1
1	unfortunately , the food was sub-par .	1	1
1	do n't bother .	1	1
1	not acceptable !	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	the service was bad and unfortunately the haircut was even worse .	1	1
1	never again , national .	1	1
1	both cars left the shop looking worse than they did when they entered .	1	1
1	the continental breakfast was ok but a little lackluster .	1	1
1	the manager on duty came out to apologize , which i did appreciate .	1	1
1	they only allow certain tiny bags in or clear plastic bags .	1	1
1	the room i was given has water damage in the ceiling near the window .	1	1
1	the service was pretty bad .	1	1
1	i ordered a hamburger with fries for $ _num_ .	1	1
1	five people could n't see an opened table clearly behind them ?	1	1
1	am i the only one ?	1	1
1	the sofa looked old and was not comfortable .	1	1
1	but their pizza was remarkably terrible .	1	1
1	espresso is pretty bad .	1	1
1	_num_ $ later , i tossed it and walked out , miserable .	1	1
1	the workers however suck balls .	1	1
1	we were seated quickly for a friday night and the server was fine .	1	1
1	very disappointed after reading the other reviews .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	i was n't impressed with my clam chowder .	1	1
1	'	1	1
1	the pizza was simply ok .	1	1
1	the staff completely ignored it .	1	1
1	crab fries , naturally .	1	1
1	consider yourself warned .	1	1
1	my husband has eaten there before and was sorely disappointed as well .	1	1
1	slow service .	1	1
1	used to be so much better .	1	1
1	it was a waste of my day time and money .	1	1
1	she did n't smile .	1	1
1	i would not return , and i can not recommend .	1	1
1	i will never try it again .	1	1
1	there was no way this order was prepared and cooked that fast .	1	1
1	could n't you have told me to move ?	1	1
1	my experience here was not great at all .	1	1
1	almost _num_ hours to get a pizza delivered .	1	1
1	my wife had the chicken pesto pasta .	1	1
1	bathroom leaks atleast _num_ times a month .	1	1
1	the shrimp was just gross .	1	1
1	they replaced the normal wooden board , and replaced it with a plate .	1	1
1	too bad even then the orders are not right .	1	1
1	the pizza at this place is o.k .	1	1
1	at this point i 'm tired of hearing that .	1	1
1	if i could give the place zero stars , i would .	1	1
1	and then _num_ minutes later , a fifth entree was brought out .	1	1
1	this whole this is just so ridiculous .	1	1
1	my salad came out shortly after the appetizer sliders .	1	1
1	they charge for internet service in the room , that 's so _num_ !	1	1
1	i was so disappointed .	1	1
1	it could be so much better .	1	1
1	there were very few vegetables to order with it .	1	1
1	korean barbecue requires either the patron or the server to cook at the table .	1	1
1	i woke up with bed bug bites all over my body !	1	1
1	we finished the meal , paid , and left without tipping .	1	1
1	the reason you would stick to this gym is the classes .	1	1
1	all i have to say is no thanks .	1	1
1	i only gave it _num_ stars because i liked my mac and cheese .	1	1
1	the service as mentioned was poor .	1	1
1	to be fair there was n't anything particularly wrong with the food or service .	1	1
1	the beds are very comfortable so you can get a good night 's sleep .	1	1
1	i probably wo n't return .	1	1
1	dry and flavorless .	1	1
1	bottom line : _num_ for _num_ bucks !	1	1
1	however , the pricing really is low when you 're lazy .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	the food was fine , but our service was atrocious .	1	1
1	an hour .	1	1
1	the slaw was also minced rather than being shredded .	1	1
1	have n't been here in a long time because the service and food suck !	1	1
1	customer service : disappointing .	1	1
1	it came highly recommended so maybe i just had a fluke experience .	1	1
1	time to find a better indian place , i 'm afraid .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	neither angel nor anyone else came to top up our drinks even once .	1	1
1	they were cold but did not taste fresh .	1	1
1	the wi-fi was free and the tv channel selections were pretty good .	1	1
1	today i gave them _num_ chance .	1	1
1	later on , we realized that there was no soap anywhere in the bathroom .	1	1
1	the pumpkin creme pie looked like it was sliced by a _num_ year old .	1	1
1	the wait staff was helpful and service was quick .	1	1

1	i wo n't go back .	1	1
1	do not use this cleaner .	1	1
1	not much , even in the used section .	1	1
1	not worth the price .	1	1
1	we will never return to this establishment for a meal again .	1	1
1	sounds sorta like stealing , does n't it ?	1	1
1	really _num_ 1/2 stars .	1	1
1	disgusting is putting it lightly .	1	1
1	the reservation was for _num_ and _num_ of us got there first .	1	1
1	after _num_ minutes we get our drink orders taken .	1	1
1	i would n't take somewhere here as a pittsburgh destination though .	1	1
1	there was a very angry woman who came running and yelled at everyone .	1	1
1	when was the last time you ate chinese food that was cold ?	1	1
1	and the food itself certainly left a lot to be desired .	1	1
1	try $ _num_ , for real .	1	1
1	simply gross .	1	1
1	do not eat the pastries !	1	1
1	potato pancakes taste like they had vinegar in them .	1	1
1	send it my way , i 'll get you payment .	1	1

1	the place just seemed small and shabby to me .	1	1
1	not happening again .	1	1
1	cake dry boring i dont believe it was home made .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	it then took another _num_ minutes to get wine glasses .	1	1
1	going through aaa is a bit worse than your average dmv .	1	1
1	epic fail on this entree .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	however , i recently missed an appointment .	1	1
1	it is difficult to get under my skin .	1	1
1	not even worth a star .	1	1
1	waited _num_ minutes for drink , waitress got my order wrong .	1	1
1	although the it includes a dish washer it does not include any dishes .	1	1
1	have been to many restaurants but this was my worst experience .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	hoping it 's just been a bad few nights .	1	1
1	first time i 've eaten here i went during lunch time .	1	1
1	i assumed i was covered for my next refill .	1	1
1	also the mushrooms were out of a can .	1	1
1	first and last to this club .	1	1
1	not a good dinner place .	1	1
1	it is a crap shoot do i get the paper ?	1	1
1	they did n't accommodate for a member of our group that had an allergy .	1	1
1	i ca n't even guess how unsanitary it might be .	1	1
1	at least _num_ in one room of the tour .	1	1
1	they have no clue what the word `` toasted '' means .	1	1
1	and they taste like cooking oil .	1	1
1	i have left bleeding twice .	1	1
1	received bad service today .	1	1
1	they 're tasty and pretty cheap .	1	1
1	still not sure i would order it again .	1	1
1	the ac in the room also did not seem to operate properly .	1	1
1	the chicken nuggets come out under par .	1	1
1	his staff is embarrassed .	1	1
1	i do n't care how many awards they have hanging on they wall .	1	1
1	the prime rib , ordered rare , was medium , dry and extremely salty .	1	1
1	the pasta a bit dry and bland as well .	1	1
1	i was hung up on twice before i could even get my order out .	1	1
1	kmart is doing okay as is the giant eagle .	1	1
1	we were eating here often , but it got boring quickly .	1	1
1	our family of six went there may _num_ , _num_ at 5:30 pm .	1	1
1	i will not return , terrible customer service .	1	1
1	i even asked my husband to check in case i missed it .	1	1
1	it 's not like they were busy .	1	1
1	service good prices cheap but food very bland and pre made .	1	1
1	i hate this place .	1	1
1	rude .	1	1
1	i was n't all that impressed with it .	1	1
1	unfortunately , it 's more than a lot of other comparable places in uptown .	1	1
1	i was wrong .	1	1
1	the staff did n't look very professional either .	1	1
1	did n't get our food until after _num_ .	1	1
1	the spot we stayed in was quite long , and very level .	1	1
1	i 'm a foodie and disappointed .	1	1
1	_num_ stars might be too generous !	1	1
1	i made a huge mistake .	1	1
1	even the bread was stale .	1	1
1	am i asking for too much ?	1	1
1	i had a burger and it was pathetic .	1	1
1	our waitress was very friendly but slow .	1	1
1	completely unacceptable !	1	1
1	shrimp had no flavor .	1	1
1	wow , i was wrong .	1	1
1	called two days later to confirm it was ready .	1	1
1	mac and cheese boring , bland , no flavor .	1	1
1	but got the invoice three days before i got the estimate .	1	1
1	food sucked and i through left overs and cake in garbage .	1	1
1	needless to say one guy was outside and one inside .	1	1
1	i would n't order food here , again .	1	1
1	it 's hit or miss with this place , but mostly a miss .	1	1
1	they have the worst customer service i have ever received in life .	1	1
1	anything to acknowledge an unacceptable wait time .	1	1
1	what an embarrassment .	1	1
1	it was very inexpensive and i understand why .	1	1
1	but of course , our food came and mine was cold .	1	1
1	my friend 's beer had a due date of november _num_ .	1	1
1	only because they were my only option .	1	1
1	a breakfast sandwich had weird burnt meat on it .	1	1
1	i did n't think it could get any worse ... .	1	1
1	the folks on the phone are incredibly rude .	1	1
1	tea was very weak and the glasses were very small .	1	1
1	i would n't be surprised to see it close .	1	1
1	will not recommend .	1	1
1	wing sauce was spilled all over bag .	1	1
1	however , i 'm mainly rating their food and service .	1	1
1	never came out to see how we were doing .	1	1
1	times , and it still is not resolved .	1	1
1	if i could give it _num_ stars i would .	1	1
1	the drinks took forever , i had something floating in my wine .	1	1
1	i would n't be as concerned if i were here for pleasure .	1	1
1	i 've never posted a yelp review before .	1	1
1	hostess also provided _num_ new lame lies .	1	1
1	not quite horrible , but not quite good either .	1	1
1	maybe , to try the breakfast everyone seems to enjoy so much .	1	1
1	well , my first time was typical mediocre kfc .	1	1
1	visited with a party of _num_ last weekend for a friend 's birthday .	1	1
1	if i could leave a lower rating , i would .	1	1
1	they are n't very friendly there at all either .	1	1
1	the food left much the be desired .	1	1
1	delivered wrong pizza .	1	1
1	i can not imagine complaints about portion size !	1	1
1	so with that said i 'm not sure i would be back .	1	1
1	you have been warned ... stay away !	1	1
1	it was just really lackluster in my opinion .	1	1
1	so why is laundry on liberty so expensive and so busted ?	1	1
1	chili 's can cook a better steak than them .	1	1
1	the bread got soggy and the darn thing fell apart .	1	1
1	the chicken tacos were good .	1	1
1	i had a very unfortunate experience with this groomer .	1	1
1	the service was not that professional !	1	1
1	flights we 're canceled so i needed to drive _num_ hours home .	1	1
1	the taste was mediocre .	1	1
1	it was a very weird situation for us .	1	1
1	the rest of the experience was kind of bizarre .	1	1
1	i was frustrated .	1	1
1	probably the rudest receptionist and office staff we have ever encountered .	1	1
1	at best , less than mediocre breakfast .	1	1
1	the bathroom door did n't close over the rug that was on the floor .	1	1
1	or , they can pick-up the entire set and provide _num_ % credit .	1	1
1	we tried to explain this and the clerk said nope , not allowed .	1	1
1	should try ordering from the menu it might be better .	1	1
1	probably one of the worst indian food i have ever had in usa .	1	1
1	i did not have a good experience here tonight .	1	1
1	waitresses was pushing hard on the chicken tenders that she loved .	1	1
1	so why does my bill say different .	1	1
1	i 'm sure they do but i had to spit mine out .	1	1
1	i had the fillet , scallops and shrimp .	1	1
1	my guess is they were understaffed .	1	1
1	getting a fitting room in that place is a disaster .	1	1
1	we had reservations for _num_ people at 7pm this past saturday .	1	1
1	avoid at all cost .	1	1
1	she did n't refill drinks .	1	1
1	been here several times and well , shame on me .	1	1
1	the owner called me to apologize .	1	1
1	on top of that , my boyfriend and i encountered the rudest staff there .	1	1
1	these a holes .	1	1
1	she received neither .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	service was n't too hot .	1	1
1	we were in an area with a server , but the service was terrible .	1	1
1	i was not impressed with the sushi either .	1	1
1	it was just a waste of $ _num_ because we could n't eat it .	1	1
1	the waitresses said little to nothing ( which is the usual case ) .	1	1
1	food quality left a lot to be improved .	1	1
1	nice courts , but horrible communication about the courts being reserved .	1	1
1	at least the place was quiet -- there were empty tables everywhere .	1	1
1	the soup was nothing to write home about .	1	1
1	you could have fooled me .	1	1
1	so we ate our apps and still no one .	1	1
1	people walked in after us and were seated .	1	1
1	but i did n't send it back because i never send anything back .	1	1
1	( oh , heck no ! )	1	1
1	it was a nightmare .	1	1
1	such a shame .	1	1
1	still no confirmation yet after _num_ days .	1	1
1	it 's so cold - like sit with your coat on cold .	1	1
1	there is very little meat on the sandwich .	1	1
1	it felt awkward to be there .	1	1
1	visited two years ago and got chicken that was raw inside .	1	1
1	the girl behind the desk told me it was $ _num_ per box .	1	1
1	but why did they sign up for this contract in the first place ?	1	1
1	it 's not worth it .	1	1
1	very bland .	1	1
1	it was way better !	1	1
1	the food was underwhelming and pricey .	1	1
1	i would n't recommend richard or the salon to anyone .	1	1
1	the combination kills it for you .	1	1
1	bad business practices are very disappointing .	1	1
1	i 've never been overly impressed with hyatt .	1	1
1	for the entree , i had the eggplant parmigiana .	1	1
1	i just could n't believe a _num_ oz .	1	1
1	not even worth one star !	1	1
1	we could n't wait to leave .	1	1
1	no one seems to be communication for efficiency .	1	1
1	i 'm never going back , and you should n't either .	1	1
1	ugh .	1	1
1	lidia should spend more time in her restaurants to see first hand .	1	1
1	that was a little awkward though .	1	1
1	the place was empty .	1	1
1	we stopped going after we got some serious attitude from our waiter .	1	1
1	this hotel does not live up to the westin standards i 'm used too .	1	1
1	no smile , no hi , nothing .	1	1
1	however , my room was foul .	1	1
1	i know its fast food - but this place is bad .	1	1
1	the manager wears face earrings , how very unprofessional .	1	1
1	they really overload the sandwiches with coleslaw and french fries .	1	1
1	the cheapest thing on the menu was $ _num_ .	1	1
1	my final piece of advice , wear comfortable shoes and stay alert .	1	1
1	it 's poor form .	1	1
1	this place is slow beyond belief .	1	1
1	i would hate to lose this place !	1	1
1	she failed to follow-up when she promised .	1	1
1	i said no , not yet which was probably a mistake .	1	1
1	stopped by tonight with a friend .	1	1
1	i always keep my university thai house leftovers for a second meal .	1	1
1	it really feels like a total lack of effort , honesty and professionalism .	1	1
1	but overall the store is way too pricy - for no good reason !	1	1
1	_num_ . )	1	1
1	no explanation at all was given .	1	1
1	there should be a negative rating on here .	1	1
1	completely bitter and disgusting !	1	1
1	another lost sale opportunity .	1	1
1	so be aware they added an automatic _num_ % gratuity to the check .	1	1
1	trash .	1	1
1	pho is ok , not bad .	1	1
1	however , the service we experienced was terrible .	1	1
1	not the shrimp , the sauce with bread dipped in .	1	1
1	they most certainly sat in broth for hours .	1	1
1	the salads came out and the plates were a little sloppy in appearance .	1	1
1	the corn bread was the only good thing in the restaurant .	1	1
1	buy their upgrades and it is a waste .	1	1
1	but today , i think i have had enough with this place .	1	1
1	very disappointed .	1	1
1	wait , ceasar salad was ok !	1	1
1	the crust was hard and flavorless .	1	1
1	the store manager 's attitude was horrible .	1	1
1	but i was n't feeling it here .	1	1
1	service is lacking and food is mediocre .	1	1
1	both were not unique in flavor or presentation .	1	1
1	even the home fries where spicy .	1	1
1	this experience was not worth the beautiful dresses .	1	1
1	the _num_ bedroom apartment we rented was a fucking dump when we moved in .	1	1
1	he kept loudly requesting a credit card and the women did not have one .	1	1
1	bbq sauce was n't good at all .	1	1
1	reputation aside the salmon cakes had no seasoning and the ribeye was tough .	1	1
1	but it just fails to deliver too often .	1	1
1	first off , everything was dripping everywhere .	1	1
1	would not go hear again .	1	1
1	i will not be going back again .	1	1
1	it is very dense and flavorless with no crunch at all .	1	1
1	_num_ bartenders on staff while the bar was completely full .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	i try to be fair ... but after _num_ strikes .	1	1
1	it 's not worth the money .	1	1
1	hertz ca n't even do what their whole company is about .	1	1
1	even a small crack with a few problems set on it .	1	1
1	you should just go to fedex where they gladly accept your patronage .	1	1
1	no soup for you !	1	1
1	these people are very unprofessional and rude .	1	1
1	i guess this nightmare will never be over .	1	1
1	oh and last thing that should n't be over looked , the shower .	1	1
1	it was just meh .	1	1
1	the door locks are a joke .	1	1
1	Negative	1	1
1	over crowded tiny gates with no place to sit or charge a phone .	1	1
1	she thought the potato side was just so-so .	1	1
1	worst airport for baggage .	1	1
1	i made an appointment weeks ago .	1	1
1	the odd food selections are maybe a cross between southern style and fake chinese .	1	1
1	however , they only have two waitresses outside for about _num_ tables .	1	1
1	i could get food faster in a prison cell .	1	1
1	we would n't have been able to sleep in even if we wanted to .	1	1
1	the eggplant was soggy and not great .	1	1
1	no call to update me or explain the delay .	1	1
1	the customer almost feels like they are bothering the workers .	1	1
1	do n't understand why people are obsessed with nasty fried chicken .	1	1
1	why does it take almost _num_ minutes to get the paperwork .	1	1
1	could have been a fluke , but i am guessing msg ?	1	1
1	on this beautiful friday evening there was no ticket office open .	1	1
1	server was very slow and was n't attentive .	1	1
1	was also told i get free $ _num_ gift certificate at restaurant.com .	1	1
1	my co-worker said the omelette was ok .	1	1
1	horrible horrible service on the phone .	1	1
1	i 've stopped coming here cause they suck to no end .	1	1
1	oh , wait .	1	1
1	the food was n't very good at all .	1	1
1	the food is basic and inexpensive , you get what you pay for .	1	1
1	it also was served at room temperature .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	she admitted it was she who answered yet refused to accommodate her mistake .	1	1
1	somewhat disappointed would best be the title for my review .	1	1
1	however , afterwards , both of us mentioned it to each other .	1	1
1	elevator always has problems .	1	1
1	one of the pieces i received was totally different from what i ordered .	1	1
1	terrible sales staff .	1	1
1	very visible and inappropriate .	1	1
1	did n't even offer a food menu .	1	1
1	sad to say , my entree was a little bland .	1	1
1	i will never never never never never go back .	1	1
1	the second bite was stringy steak .	1	1
1	trashy , nasty and extremely rude staff .	1	1
1	she was hesitant to give me a straight up answer .	1	1
1	yes , i was a little stressed .	1	1
1	to many restaurants want my patronage .	1	1
1	the pasta was overcooked and the shrimp just sort of were there .	1	1
1	i brought my boots here to get fixed .	1	1
1	i hear oyster bar and think delicious raw oysters not deep fried crap .	1	1
1	avoid harris grill .	1	1
1	i had to pay them to waste my time and do nothing !	1	1
1	they came out on a sunday which is much appreciated .	1	1
1	honestly i am not convinced our billing ever did get corrected .	1	1
1	our tour guide was the worst tour guide i 've ever had .	1	1
1	just a poor design all around .	1	1
1	bland .	1	1
1	from the food to the prices , you could n't find better .	1	1
1	i 've had appointments with salon owners and never had to leave payment info .	1	1
1	wrong !	1	1
1	they should have been included in the price of the brunch .	1	1
1	i was overall unhappy with the service and the food at this establishment .	1	1
1	terrible terrible .	1	1
1	i really do n't know why i bother with chain restaurants anymore .	1	1
1	the bun was soggy and gooey .	1	1
1	do n't waste your time or money .	1	1
1	italian sausage was bland at best .	1	1
1	i 'll be sure to spend my money elsewhere next time .	1	1
1	this place barely uses any flavor other than salt and msg .	1	1
1	we mention our reservation , he says no problem _num_ min ... great !	1	1
1	the food was absolutely mediocre .	1	1
1	this version of dick 's does n't get me excited .	1	1
1	i have been there _num_ times .	1	1
1	pay less has better !	1	1
1	not pleased with all the hidden costs behind my hair color service .	1	1
1	they screwed up a club sandwich & fries .	1	1
1	and there was no alcohol in it .	1	1
1	this place wo n't be around for too much longer i 'm sure .	1	1
1	i say `` some '' turkey wrap because it was really that unimpressive !	1	1
1	also , the service is slow and poor .	1	1
1	no one goes to applebees because they want outstanding food .	1	1
1	seating inside is very limited .	1	1
1	i will not be returning .	1	1
1	it was n't bad , just nothing great .	1	1
1	no one to help with bags morning or night .	1	1
1	the coffee was disappointing -- it came with plastic cups of half & half .	1	1
1	the blond hostess refused .	1	1
1	the food was even worse than i remembered .	1	1
1	it was gross .	1	1
1	my first visit was to the one in south hills .	1	1
1	the place was much less noisy and crowded at my second visit .	1	1
1	i ordered food that i believed was gluten free .	1	1
1	the manager was rude when giving me my order .	1	1
1	what a mess of a hotel .	1	1
1	if not for the nice waitress , would have been _num_ star .	1	1
1	this place is the worst !	1	1
1	not good .	1	1
1	sorry we picked it after reading rave reviews online .	1	1
1	so bland .	1	1
1	so he ca n't bother with mine .	1	1
1	real bad .	1	1
1	she never even looked at me .	1	1
1	she 's either incompetent or she ruined my hair on purpose .	1	1
1	service is the reason why i will never give the food another chance .	1	1
1	i would have felt better if she had said that she was sorry .	1	1
1	i would not recommend uptown retreat .	1	1
1	it 's a gas station , how hard can it be ?	1	1
1	i wo n't go back to this location .	1	1
1	dirty and slow .	1	1
1	i do not recommend this place .	1	1
1	but i 'm not going to anymore .	1	1
1	i always notice that chicks is super slow .	1	1
1	that was disappointing .	1	1
1	very disappointed .	1	1
1	i could n't taste salt or pepper or garlic or even feel any heat .	1	1
1	if you stand near the soda fountain area it will smell like sewage .	1	1
1	honestly some of the worst service i 've ever received anywhere .	1	1
1	voicemail is all you get with no returned calls by the way !	1	1
1	once they have you they make it hard to escape .	1	1
1	service was horrible !	1	1
1	atmosphere was casual but prices were upscale .	1	1
1	disgusting ... .	1	1
1	do n't waste your time here .	1	1
1	dead roach on the bamboo on my steam dumpling basket .	1	1
1	the last _num_ hoagies i 've gotten here is again only mediocre .	1	1
1	the noodles were very bland and almost chewy .	1	1
1	avoid .	1	1
1	i thought the turkey was slimy and tasted weird .	1	1
1	no bill no nothing .	1	1
1	fuck that i do n't need to be disrespected like that .	1	1
1	this was sorely lacking .	1	1
1	do n't waste your time at this office .	1	1
1	you try holding a scared cat in a room full of dogs .	1	1
1	husband had chicken & cheese enchiladas and said they were bland .	1	1
1	but would it kill you to spend a little to upgrade your rooms ?	1	1
1	it 's not .	1	1
1	and , its not good .	1	1
1	i have never felt more uncomfortable in a retail store before .	1	1
1	`` apologies for the mistake .	1	1
1	no note or sign for explanation .	1	1
1	_num_ . )	1	1
1	when the pizza finally arrived , it was almost doughy it was so undercooked !	1	1
1	i vote time warner cable the worst company of all times .	1	1
1	this is simply a customer service review .	1	1
1	there were five very small shrimp on the plate .	1	1
1	unfortunately being a charlotte institution does not mean tasty food .	1	1
1	that 's probably how they got so sick !	1	1
1	it really is pure torture sometimes .	1	1
1	food was awful .	1	1
1	it was dry and tasteless .	1	1
1	how can a restaurant not have proper seating for its paying customers ?	1	1
1	wo n't be coming back .	1	1
1	why even reserve a car when they are n't going to have it ?	1	1
1	if you hated your job that much just quit .	1	1
1	frozen dough with chopped vegetables on it , little or no sauce .	1	1
1	will never return to any location !	1	1
1	my salad was serviced in a tea cup plate .	1	1
1	the manager was rude and not very accommodating .	1	1
1	i have never dealt with such poor management in my life .	1	1
1	the reason why i rate this place low is the atmosphere is abysmal .	1	1
1	after all that , the treatment didnt work at all .	1	1
1	it really just is a crap place to live .	1	1
1	parking sucks .	1	1
1	the lunch took _num_ hours .	1	1
1	well scratch the quick now .	1	1
1	no ... not a sir and i wanted to order mozzarella wheels .	1	1
1	it 's not a very good longhorn .	1	1
1	it is april and there are no grass tees yet .	1	1
1	support local businesses , but make sure they are deserving of your money !	1	1
1	it 's difficult to do business with a company that you do not trust .	1	1
1	the meat was extremely bland , with very little seasoning .	1	1
1	there was no soup or anything kind of body was .	1	1
1	this hertz location is a complete toss up .	1	1
1	how about horrible customer service ?	1	1
1	not good .	1	1
1	sure enough , a few minutes later it was on my table .	1	1
1	waste and pet waste all over .	1	1
1	food was not good on three occasions .	1	1
1	he was there for approximately _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	i wish i 'd read these reviews before deciding to stay here .	1	1
1	it 's absolutely disgusting , and you get no peace whatsoever .	1	1
1	really only space for our 5th wheel .	1	1
1	there is no other way to describe everything in my room .	1	1
1	this place is going downhill fast .	1	1
1	all the white people get to eat , we do not ?	1	1
1	tried a variety of foods & none have been particularly good .	1	1
1	bun was also cold like just out of the refrigerator .	1	1
1	edit : in my original review i stated this procedure was $ _num_ .	1	1
1	horrible !	1	1
1	second , the rolls here are sloppy .	1	1
1	eggs were cold and the fresh fruit was n't fresh .	1	1
1	it was turned into gray meat and cost almost _num_ dollars .	1	1
1	cheap eats yes but not high quality just typical flavor i guess .	1	1
1	u can find all the yummy food on the authentic menu .	1	1
1	the sub was not one bit better than subway .	1	1
1	all honesty , you are better off going somewhere else or a different location .	1	1
1	i past here daily and will never patronize this establishment again .	1	1
1	showed up to the ghetto as expected , but the meal was underwhelming .	1	1
1	they had n't been cleaned properly .	1	1
1	the lamb chops were awful .	1	1
1	do n't waste your money .	1	1
1	so , it 's not really much of a win at all .	1	1
1	the second was passable , but nothing special .	1	1
1	omg what a nightmare .	1	1
1	we always took the trash out .	1	1
1	no need to ever return .	1	1
1	the food handling left much to be desired .	1	1
1	the pancakes were pretty tasty , though .	1	1
1	the place is a total dump .	1	1
1	duke energy pulled some really shady crap on us .	1	1
1	no apology or explanation , just a bad attitude .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	he make sure that all of the customers incorrect orders are made correctly .	1	1
1	mostly negative , but hey i was hungry and gave it a shot .	1	1
1	try house of lee instead .	1	1
1	i took a _num_ lb package to ups and asked for a quote .	1	1
1	nothing in charlotte is that special for me to go through all that .	1	1
1	they get _num_ star because less was not an option .	1	1
1	the line behind me very long and no concession was offered .	1	1
1	if there were zero stars i would give that rating instead !	1	1
1	a completely clueless one , that 's what kind .	1	1
1	there are no frills , there are no items i would particularly recommend .	1	1
1	avoid hertz and go with a reputable company instead .	1	1
1	the fries are very salty .	1	1
1	charlotte ... could suck less but there are some things they are doing ok .	1	1
1	the food ai n't bad .	1	1
1	it 's a lot better than the nothing that i got .	1	1
1	more midnight traffic than a _num_ hour dennys .	1	1
1	very busy place for rather mediocre food .	1	1
1	even managers saw us sitting there and didnt bother to greet us .	1	1
1	it was no more than _num_ minutes long .	1	1
1	the food came out cold and not fresh .	1	1
1	it was not a gluten free menu at all !	1	1
1	please pay attention to the negative reviews before you experience carmel family physicians .	1	1
1	you 're better off with a garden hose .	1	1
1	almost immediately she came back and said her manager refused to change our bill .	1	1
1	the meat itself did not taste good .	1	1
1	so i was appalled by a lousy not fresh dirty salad !	1	1
1	it was bad .	1	1
1	very sad .	1	1
1	somehow i feel like they have served chicken from the day before .	1	1
1	smoked salmon plus creamy sauce , yum .	1	1

1	we feel completely cheated .	1	1
1	Neutral	1	1
1	my server was nice , but not friendly at all .	1	1
1	for one , the service was terrible .	1	1

1	it looked rather like a barber shop .	1	1
1	not a ton of flavor there either .	1	1
1	the auto show was a disappointment .	1	1
1	big fail on that expectation .	1	1
1	very , very slow service .	1	1
1	they should be closed down for good and removed from the park .	1	1
1	i really wish i had read these reviews before ordering from this company .	1	1
1	i had visiting family and they tried to sit us at separate tables ?	1	1
1	there is no reason that they should n't have caught that he was dying .	1	1
1	all said , we spent $ _num_ for soul food !	1	1
1	like a cup of water mixed condiments was poured on the burger .	1	1
1	if there was a way to give no stars i would .	1	1
1	on second though i think my cafeteria was better .	1	1
1	it was super busy and only _num_ employees were making food .	1	1
1	ok , so i really wanted to like this place .	1	1
1	literally on even one croutons or slice of tomato nothing but shredded lettuce .	1	1
1	the only thing they did n't want to do was flush my brake fluid .	1	1
1	they simply ca n't get the orders right .	1	1
1	the waiter was loud and annoying and our drinks ran out several times .	1	1
1	really disappointed .	1	1

1	i really wanted to like this place , but i really did n't .	1	1

1	she said ummm not really !	1	1
1	the food is quite bland .	1	1

1	very loud , bad service , and the food does n't met the expectations .	1	1
1	their patient referral service is n't any better .	1	1
1	avoid this company like the plague .	1	1
1	the customer service however has been lacking each and every time .	1	1
1	would n't go back .	1	1
1	fail !	1	1
1	talking to friends over the weekend , we were told it was pretty good .	1	1
1	so now i have a very sick kitten on my hands .	1	1
1	nothing happens .	1	1
1	a place i would go back to but not regularly .	1	1
1	more than one occasion they came before the agreed upon time .	1	1
1	however , my dish was nothing to brag about .	1	1
1	they were gracious to direct us to signs that got us out of parking .	1	1
1	the home fries were just diced potatoes .	1	1
1	not keeping with the the _num_ star yelp review that brought us here .	1	1
1	for my entree , i tried the lasagna recommended by the waiter .	1	1
1	i 'd have to say it was no where near an awesome experience .	1	1
1	the wait staff was not that great either !	1	1
1	horrible service and food .	1	1
1	$ _num_ for one meatball and three bites of pasta .	1	1
1	this place is sad .	1	1
1	what a joke of a company .	1	1
1	then she gave it to us before thinking to ask if we wanted another .	1	1
1	the spaghetti tasted no different than boxed pasta .	1	1
1	i was disappointed with the seafood salad .	1	1
1	the customer next to me asked three more times very nicely for the water .	1	1
1	( not the waitress ) .	1	1
1	i was offended .	1	1
1	i can not get over how unprofessional and rude this office staff is !	1	1
1	more pear shaped , waitress was no where to be found for _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	we stood there for _num_ minutes waiting for somebody to take our order .	1	1
1	it was not even $ _num_ including se day shipping !	1	1

1	i mean really , this is ridiculous .	1	1
1	there 's nothing fast about this fast food .	1	1
1	over _num_ % of the restaurant was filled with people from our convention .	1	1
1	service is slow and horrible .	1	1
1	when i picked it up , it did not fit !	1	1
1	i will not be going back to this doctor .	1	1
1	however , no matter what you will always find a bad store .	1	1
1	service was just ok .	1	1
1	major disappointment !	1	1
1	my boyfriend came with me to eat but was not eating .	1	1
1	i have shopped at harris teeter park road for over _num_ years .	1	1
1	coffee is not that bad and it is convenient if nothing else .	1	1
1	however i agree with the previous reviews that the staff are killing it .	1	1
1	food can be pretty good , service can be pretty bad .	1	1
1	he had a replacement steak that was just the same as the first .	1	1
1	the staff was very unhelpful .	1	1
1	this hotel was a mistake from beginning to end .	1	1
1	the music is horrible , but most sport bars have that trend .	1	1
1	the waitress the first time i went was a little short , not personable .	1	1
1	but based on other reviews , even this is n't always the case .	1	1
1	they would just sell all there stuff and buy new on the other end .	1	1
1	avoid this place like the plague !	1	1
1	yes , my food was tasty ( _num_ on a scale of 1-10 ) .	1	1
1	exercise equipment and some of the dryers and washing machine were broken .	1	1
1	this was one of the worst dinners out i 've had in recent memory .	1	1
1	it was n't even a super busy night either .	1	1
1	i explained to her that this has been going on for weeks .	1	1
1	it appears this location has a serious management issue .	1	1
1	it 's probably cause its just meant for sports and drinks .	1	1
1	but when i 'm on a budget i choose motel _num_ .	1	1
1	service was sub par at best .	1	1
1	this is no longer the chicken box cafe .	1	1
1	service was absolutely horrible !	1	1
1	so on to the sushi , oh yeah , it 's gross too !	1	1
1	this place is out of my dry cleaning budget !	1	1
1	i stuck them in my mouth and wow ... they were flavorless .	1	1
1	the food was uninspired , tired , and ordinary .	1	1
1	this mcdonald 's is so bad it 's amazing .	1	1
1	so disappointed .	1	1
1	although nothing was awful , i would n't come back .	1	1
1	i am also disabled and have a service animal .	1	1
1	_num_ ) my hot chocolate was just gross .	1	1
1	some pieces were way over cooked .	1	1
1	clearly , they do n't need my business .	1	1
1	the rest of the food was overly heavy and greasy .	1	1
1	i quickly ate and left to make my movie .	1	1
1	that 's _num_ % .	1	1
1	i am a vegetarian , so i was already limited in my choices .	1	1
1	this place is a joke at best .	1	1
1	does n't work .	1	1
1	it was downhill from there .	1	1
1	this place only exists because of its prime downtown location .	1	1
1	i had an italian mojito which i do n't recommend , period ... blech .	1	1
1	while waiting on the manager , the angry cashier would n't shut her mouth .	1	1
1	very bland and it actually tasted baked not grilled .	1	1
1	otherwise , do n't be fooled .	1	1
1	you will leave smelling like cooking oil .	1	1
1	so i then went on to tell her what i wanted on my burger .	1	1
1	as for my ca rolls , the avocado was all brown !	1	1
1	waitress did apologize for cup but it was too late - chose to leave .	1	1
1	mens room did n't have any paper towels to dry hands with .	1	1
1	this was my first trip to charlotte .	1	1
1	service was average to bad .	1	1
1	i wish i had read their reviews prior to going .	1	1
1	to top it off the place looked and smelled dirty .	1	1
1	service was great but it sure was n't morton 's quality ?	1	1
1	that he did n't know there was a problem ?	1	1
1	worst customer service !	1	1
1	it is a white pizza with minimal ingredients except for the lamb skewers .	1	1
1	these folks are not honest and just want you out of there quickly .	1	1
1	it is a shame because buffalo blues does have potential .	1	1
1	i took my dog in got his medication , it cleared up immediately .	1	1
1	disappointment .	1	1
1	it was not .	1	1
1	the standard is appalling .	1	1
1	if your not a chain smoker , opt for takeout .	1	1
1	took my friends from out of town to lidia last night , very disappointed .	1	1
1	the service did n't get any better .	1	1
1	talk about unpleasant .	1	1
1	the experience was nothing close to nice or upscale .	1	1
1	after pasta , comes the protein , that includes meatballs , then finally salad .	1	1
1	a piece of two layer cake , is over six dollars .	1	1
1	i came in for my first visit and was very disappointed .	1	1
1	later , i went to the other bartender for another water .	1	1
1	do n't you do this all day ?	1	1
1	avoid this place .	1	1
1	honestly wish i could give it zero stars based on today ... ?	1	1
1	neither the brown sugar bacon and beef nor the blt had much bacon .	1	1
1	they just cost me money and lost my tires .	1	1
1	just do n't do it !	1	1
1	i 'm sure there 's still a lot of room for improvement , however .	1	1
1	i can only say that this hotel has zero commitment to customer service .	1	1
1	however , it was also past lukewarm to the point of being cool .	1	1
1	we ended up with our glasses 3/4 full and a watered down juice cocktail .	1	1
1	so please , i trust you to just make me look hot . ''	1	1
1	cucumbers that had seen much better days before they wound up on my sandwich .	1	1
1	and when the dessert came it was ice cold and solid as a rock .	1	1
1	they do not care about animals .	1	1
1	my soul purpose to coming here was to get my license picture taken .	1	1
1	so she is choosing one paying customer over another .	1	1
1	the crust was bland and the filling seemed sparse .	1	1
1	horrible .	1	1
1	always seem to be people going in and out .	1	1
1	do not go to this car wash .	1	1
1	i ca n't imagine anyone liking this super bland cardboard !	1	1
1	a good family dollar this is not !	1	1
1	not a fan !	1	1
1	but do n't feel this way .	1	1
1	they need a complete overhaul of management and employees .	1	1
1	i had two items : a caesar salad , and a margherita pizza .	1	1
1	about _num_ % more expensive .	1	1
1	i consider a brunch with mom on mothers day ruined when mom is apologizing .	1	1
1	the egg on my wife 's eggs benedict was over-cooked .	1	1
1	no joke , not polite , or friendly just rude and a jerk .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	we counted _num_ parties , thats it ... in a otherwise bare restaurant .	1	1
1	my new goal is to deter anybody i know away from dollar bank .	1	1
1	not good kinda left feeling sick .	1	1
1	just do n't go here especially if you have natural hair .	1	1
1	i 've never been treated so poorly .	1	1
1	this is totally unacceptable .	1	1
1	surprisingly what remains seems to be doing good business .	1	1
1	i do n't know maybe it was a bad night i went on .	1	1
1	it was very cheap - but i guess you get what you pay for .	1	1
1	food is hit or miss -- usually , miss .	1	1
1	the produce was n't always kept up well either .	1	1
1	my husband said , i 'm looking for some dress shirts and pants .	1	1
1	i paid $ _num_ for a partial .	1	1
1	i even ate a couple and the sauces were yummy .	1	1
1	but this was going on long before i arrived at 5pm .	1	1
1	for the pizza , ugh .	1	1
1	i would strongly advise against living here .	1	1
1	the salmon was ok but not worth the $ _num_ either .	1	1
1	`` i 'm sorry , we close at six . ''	1	1
1	the rose sauce was n't as flavorful as i would expect .	1	1
1	we tried to order for delivery because we are _num_ miles away .	1	1
1	i got no lettuce tomatoes etc as i requested .	1	1

1	i 've tried and tried to give this place a chance .	1	1
1	terrible .	1	1
1	never going back .	1	1
1	the 4th time my friend dragged me there , i had a salad .	1	1
1	but the food is horrible .	1	1
1	i never once got a refill , even when i asked .	1	1
1	so this past friday i held a birthday dinner for my mother here .	1	1
1	bland bbq , bland chicken .	1	1
1	staff very rude .	1	1
1	it was very unprofessional .	1	1
1	some of the salads are alright , but its just not good food .	1	1
1	at _num_ am and two phone calls , still no coffee .	1	1
1	and it was very annoying !	1	1
1	i immediately changed rooms and the tv did not work .	1	1
1	i did n't appreciate it , understand it , or like it at all .	1	1
1	the atmosphere is also drab and just depressing .	1	1
1	i 'm not sure its all made in-house anymore .	1	1
1	the pork was moist and tender , but very bland .	1	1
1	the bruce company is very , very expensive .	1	1
1	and sure enough , cue tuesday -- no call .	1	1
1	we told her just to charge us whatever and we were ready to leave .	1	1
1	however , the food was borderline bad .	1	1
1	i gave up and refused the offer for another .	1	1
1	the shuttle driver claimed he was never told about a _num_ pickup .	1	1
1	the manager could n't have cared less .	1	1
1	waiter was awful and food ( pad thai ) was not much better .	1	1
1	this restaurant has really gone downhill over the last few years .	1	1
1	the air conditioning was non existent , which is a hangover nightmare .	1	1
1	i could understand if they were busy , but it was n't at all .	1	1
1	_num_ ) they did not return my $ _num_ security deposit .	1	1
1	only thing open is starbucks .	1	1
1	do n't order from this shop if you want a timely delivery .	1	1
1	ummm ... excuse me !	1	1
1	very disappointed with this place .	1	1
1	will not go back .	1	1
1	they call me up and tell me the tire is the wrong size .	1	1
1	i really thought they were much better than this .	1	1
1	luckily i left myself enough time to just barely make it to my interview .	1	1
1	let me say , this place is not somewhere to eat .	1	1
1	it was quite crowded .	1	1
1	i guess they figured i 'd likely keep it for another week .	1	1
1	not real italian .	1	1
1	the restroom had no paper towels , and the trash cans were overflowing .	1	1
1	for me the food was terrible .	1	1
1	but it was not the dress she ordered .	1	1
1	i do not like this company .	1	1
1	bad decision .	1	1
1	this place is extremely overrated .	1	1
1	most indoor ranges charge by lane , not person .	1	1
1	painfully slow .	1	1

1	the people who work here are very rude .	1	1
1	_num_ dollars ?	1	1
1	it 's a shame .	1	1
1	rude .	1	1
1	i had heard it was good , but the food was terrible .	1	1
1	i 'm no barbeque expert but this food plain did n't taste good .	1	1
1	i can not recommend anyone doing business at uptown retreat salon .	1	1
1	no excuse for this .	1	1
1	worst experience !	1	1
1	no way will they get away with this .	1	1
1	it was just average , nothing special .	1	1
1	wait time in the drive thru runs between _num_ to _num_ minutes !	1	1
1	over _num_ % of the class failed the final .	1	1
1	no call , nothing .	1	1
1	perhaps leftovers from the _num_ steakhouse sale .	1	1
1	however , their employees and even the manager could n't be efficient about this .	1	1
1	then the chef comes out to rush us .	1	1
1	cleaning of the room is suppose to be on tuesday .	1	1
1	worst management ever .	1	1
1	negative experience # _num_ :	1	1
1	they dont go over the math which is a big part of the test .	1	1
1	and followed up with `` why would n't you pay for this ? ''	1	1
1	the downside : the alterations were very expensive and very poorly done .	1	1
1	i 've went for _num_ years now waiting for it to become something good .	1	1
1	there was 1/4 lb .	1	1
1	the baristas are not friendly .	1	1
1	the blueberry mojito had an overpowering taste of rum .	1	1
1	but you know how some dive bars have charm ?	1	1
1	i immediately noticed that the store is dark and dated .	1	1
1	so bad !	1	1
1	walls are thin .	1	1
1	i 'm currently still sitting at the airport nearly _num_ hours later .	1	1
1	i asked for a refund and she said how much was it ?	1	1
1	of course the hostess acted like an office temp , with a bad attitude .	1	1
1	it 's neither good or bad , really .	1	1
1	not impressed .	1	1
1	completely unacceptable .	1	1
1	blew my mind away , but than again i will never get people .	1	1
1	so dirty i decided i could not eat here .	1	1
1	but sadly , they have lost the art of making great food .	1	1
1	that was not acceptable to me .	1	1
1	please take all of these negative reviews seriously because they are valid .	1	1
1	poor planning .	1	1
1	only passable pasta was the pear & ricotta ravioli .	1	1
1	the one i had at this salon was among the worst .	1	1
1	waited for _num_ mins past appointment time .	1	1
1	i would not recommend staying !	1	1
1	the number of channels is limited .	1	1
1	it literally sounds like there is a major concert going on .	1	1
1	_num_ dollars for two that i 'll never see again .	1	1
1	we ate our dinner quickly because of how hungry we were .	1	1
1	risotto , while one of my favorites , is n't pasta .	1	1
1	for the price , the food was awful .	1	1
1	the lights were broken and the room was filthy .	1	1
1	it felt like a dish that had been reheated in the microwave .	1	1
1	the pasta was a little undercooked and the sauce was ok .	1	1
1	it was bitter cold outside .	1	1
1	my fiance had ribs that were mostly fat and gristle .	1	1
1	to me , that basically means that he has no idea what is wrong .	1	1
1	was so excited to get your pizza today .	1	1
1	despite having over _num_ rooms , they only have _num_ elevators .	1	1
1	i felt terrible for this woman .	1	1
1	this one is a big fail .	1	1
1	the worst hotel experience ever !	1	1
1	but it was cheap and the corn bread was excellent .	1	1
1	if i could give this hotel zero stars , i would .	1	1
1	seems like she do n't wanted to take care of the customers .	1	1
1	this was my big mistake .	1	1
1	i am not exaggerating in the least .	1	1
1	this is the absolute worst steak n shake i 've ever been to .	1	1
1	seating too close together .	1	1
1	the server never apologized .	1	1
1	the better restaurant is the little cafe across the street owned by same owner .	1	1
1	the crust was rubbery and stale even though the chicken was very hot .	1	1
1	disgusting .	1	1
1	he was just trying to rip me off again .	1	1
1	the private room we were in was nice but cold .	1	1
1	promptly left , wo n't be back .	1	1
1	no one assisted us or even apologized for the inconvenience .	1	1
1	avoid at all costs .	1	1
1	it did seem a little unwelcoming and a little dated .	1	1
1	bland would be an understatement .	1	1
1	)	1	1
1	i 'm only writing this to save someone else from wasting money .	1	1
1	that 's what i get for being lazy , probably .	1	1
1	i 'm sorry , this place is simply not good .	1	1
1	this place has sadly become the worst mexican food place ever , for me .	1	1
1	could n't be further from the truth .	1	1
1	the portions here are huge ( the one constant ) .	1	1
1	but you know what words i do n't mind hearing ?	1	1
1	vegetarian lunch was bland .	1	1
1	this place is dirty and the coffee is horrible .	1	1
1	almost every time i have been let down .	1	1

1	not a lot of character , but cheap prices .	1	1
1	i ordered the salmon cakes with mac & cheese and yams .	1	1
1	my stomach was in knots for hours .	1	1
1	this place just made me feel so uncomfortable .	1	1
1	not worth your money .	1	1
1	stay away , there are many better options downtown .	1	1
1	skip it and try somewhere else for a spa pedicure .	1	1
1	for an appetizer , _num_ entrees , and naan .	1	1
1	overpriced merchandise that does not last .	1	1
1	the service has also suffered tremendously .	1	1
1	he just put it on the bill .	1	1
1	tonight 's experience is one of the worst restaurant experiences i 've ever had .	1	1
1	why does this place always smell bad ?	1	1
1	avoid this shop .	1	1
1	they have a hot vegetarian sandwich , but it sounds gross .	1	1
1	the food was to die for and the service was perfection .	1	1
1	i ca n't begin to express my disappointment in your establishment .	1	1
1	nothing wrong with paying up for great food , but blue was n't it .	1	1
1	and then it was only because we flagged someone down .	1	1
1	asked to have it reheated , still came back cold .	1	1
1	i stood there for approx 5-7 mins before i was even acknowledged .	1	1
1	it 's an embarrassment on walnut .	1	1
1	do they train them to be rude and ignorant ?	1	1
1	-i split the giant beer battered fish sandwich .	1	1
1	service was extremely poor and bar service was also extremely poor .	1	1
1	i had spaghetti and meatballs and a caesar salad .	1	1
1	shame on you jiffy lube !	1	1
1	there were no other diners in the restaurant .	1	1
1	a complete waste of money , avoid at all costs .	1	1
1	too much dressing in a salad that did n't even fill the bowl .	1	1
1	he was n't rude , i think just not up on server etiquette .	1	1
1	soups were borderline offensive .	1	1
1	couldnt give them zero stars .	1	1
1	i 'm in town for business , and went on a week night .	1	1
1	in conclusion ... yea ... we 're not coming back .	1	1
1	the food is bad !	1	1
1	she said that they consider all the patty to be meat .	1	1
1	as much as i hate olive garden ... i would preferred that .	1	1
1	gross .	1	1
1	i hardly ever send food back or complain but this was really bad .	1	1
1	they told me they wont give me the corporate number .	1	1
1	there is nothing to eat within walking distance .	1	1
1	sometimes a liquor license is not the best investment !	1	1
1	the bathrooms smelled like stale urine and the floors were very sticky .	1	1
1	very annoyed and ignorant !	1	1
1	honestly i do n't consider this place a mall .	1	1
1	can not justify giving money to someone who runs their business in that manner .	1	1
1	terrible !	1	1
1	this place was really busy when we arrived so it seemed promising .	1	1
1	the cleanliness of the bathrooms is less than desirable .	1	1
1	i did n't even say goodbye to the friend who had brought me there .	1	1
1	i feel bad for those that fell for this .	1	1
1	i am definitely not going to the place again .	1	1
1	my problem is with the alterations department .	1	1
1	i most likely wo n't be back to one for a very long time .	1	1
1	either way , on a saturday night , i would n't recommend going here .	1	1
1	so disappointed with this place !	1	1
1	ordered a chicken quesadilla for an app which was really good .	1	1

1	however , i had the absolute worst hotel experience at the pittsburgh westin .	1	1
1	so help me god , i do n't care .	1	1
1	not tasty at all .	1	1
1	come for the food and not the atmosphere or service .	1	1
1	the staff called the cops who are apparently there but not doing anything .	1	1
1	i waited _num_ hour and _num_ minutes for my pizza to be delivered .	1	1
1	- and they left me hanging .	1	1
1	very sad to find that donuts are made the day before .	1	1
1	they have to have paid their way into magazines rating them highly !	1	1
1	there are not much options for buffet on sunday .	1	1
1	lastly , we made our reservations through open table , which was honored .	1	1
1	this is on a weekend ( saturday night - sunday morning ) .	1	1
1	and i was denied priority boarding .	1	1
1	i received no apologies or explanation as to why it took so long .	1	1
1	it was nasty .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	the chicken salad is made with turkey .	1	1
1	they seem to have some of the slowest service too .	1	1
1	the room i had was bland , one piece of ugly artwork .	1	1
1	they simply did n't care .	1	1
1	tasted bland and watered down to me .	1	1
1	sad to say i wo n't take friends here again .	1	1
1	servers had awesome personalities and were very hospitable .	1	1
1	buffalo shrimp $ _num_ you get _num_ , barely enough to share .	1	1

1	i 'm begging you .	1	1
1	when the food arrived it was mediocre at best .	1	1
1	called several airlines they were unable to find anything .	1	1
1	i do n't get this place .	1	1
1	i ate here when it opened , a and again _num_ years later .	1	1
1	after going here for years , boy were we disappointed .	1	1
1	you could n't pay me to go back to this place !	1	1
1	ugh .	1	1
1	breeze and the cat was tested and was negative .	1	1
1	i recently went into this eat n park and had a horrible experience .	1	1
1	this used to be one of my absolute favorite places to eat .	1	1
1	we will not be back .	1	1
1	unfortunately i do n't know what happened ?	1	1
1	that is the most ridiculous thing i 've ever heard .	1	1
1	i will never go back to total bond .	1	1
1	the furniture is worn and dirty .	1	1
1	tonight , we walked in and went up to the counter with our beer .	1	1
1	horrible .	1	1
1	i walked in and was ignored .	1	1
1	i 'm not joking .	1	1
1	truly awful .	1	1
1	this place is one of the worst dental offices i 've ever walked into .	1	1
1	needless to say i will never set foot in this place again .	1	1
1	_num_ . )	1	1
1	a/c unit was very loud .	1	1
1	thanks , but no .	1	1
1	finally order and pull around , i wait another five minutes .	1	1
1	zero flavor , zero filling , frozen wan tons ?	1	1
1	this results in my paying $ _num_ i should n't have had to pay .	1	1
1	immediately walking in you are struck by a smell .	1	1
1	it was covered with chopped green herbs .	1	1
1	for a vegetarian place , there was nothing green on our plates .	1	1
1	the chili soup was n't hot .	1	1
1	* the owner failed to mention the pita bread was extra .	1	1
1	terrible customer service !	1	1
1	a very frustrating moment indeed .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	what a disaster -- so bad it hurts .	1	1
1	i 'm really confused about the positive reviews of this place .	1	1
1	this is the worst thai food i have ever had .	1	1
1	so , i am really really disappointed carowinds .	1	1
1	the decor is old school and seems satisfied in it 's current state .	1	1
1	i could have spoken to him in _num_ minutes and gotten out of there .	1	1
1	panera quality should be consistent no matter what location you visit .	1	1
1	what a disappointment !	1	1
1	that was not fair to her and definitely not fair to us .	1	1
1	$ _num_ mistake ( _num_ people ) .	1	1
1	it 's lettuce , cheese , and pine nuts !	1	1
1	i just need to avoid bagel sandwiches ... .	1	1
1	they have switched sauces , the usual peanut sauce was missing .	1	1
1	this place has the worst service i 've ever seen .	1	1
1	i 'm not a fan .	1	1
1	`` free wifi '' never works , not a big deal .	1	1
1	other than that , they really do n't have any other specials .	1	1
1	shame on me .	1	1
1	it did n't taste fresh at all .	1	1
1	atmosphere is cluttered and tables are too close together for any privacy .	1	1
1	now , not worth the salt .	1	1
1	she turned out to be the only pleasant person during my whole experience .	1	1
1	bad texture .	1	1
1	very outdated on the inside .	1	1
1	the pizza bagels were soggy yet burned .	1	1
1	the chicken fajita was over cooked , dry , and charred .	1	1
1	the staff i dealt with could not have cared less about helping me .	1	1
1	we get our bill and come to find out it 's $ _num_ .	1	1
1	do n't waste your time !	1	1
1	this is not a bad place to live .	1	1
1	it was calamari on top of some salad with thai chili sauce dressing .	1	1
1	i tried to ask for some , but she walked away .	1	1
1	nobody greets you when you walk in .	1	1
1	highly recommend that no one ever goes here .	1	1
1	bland and disappointing , the pho most of all .	1	1
1	noisy , noisy bar !	1	1
1	also the driver forgot to bring my drinks .	1	1
1	so , i will never be back .	1	1
1	do n't waste your time eating here .	1	1
1	the bed was very uncomfortable !	1	1
1	it was so dry that it was impossible to eat without liquid .	1	1
1	`` me never come back here '' .	1	1
1	worst grocery store i 've ever been to .	1	1
1	the only good thing this restaurant has going for it , is their bar !	1	1
1	we had a printed voucher that we paid for that was n't honored .	1	1
1	the district manager of this bakery to make sure it does not happen again .	1	1
1	pay more elsewhere for better quality .	1	1
1	rude .	1	1
1	also , the portions are not as big .	1	1
1	this is a very odd restaurant .	1	1
1	waitress was nice but it 's obvious that this place is run poorly .	1	1
1	do not stay here .	1	1
1	these people are totally incompetent .	1	1
1	we ordered a large steak stromboli with extra cheese through grub hub .	1	1
1	i do n't need to receive attitude from a receptionist .	1	1
1	unfortunately that is where the good news stops !	1	1
1	it was very cold .	1	1
1	this place just does not seem serious about business standards and drinks were weak .	1	1
1	rant over .	1	1
1	this was flat , one note .	1	1
1	you disappointed me .	1	1
1	this place did n't have the authentic taste i was looking for .	1	1
1	it 's basically the typical americanized , overpriced sit-down chinese restaurant .	1	1
1	beware veterans , they do not acknowledge war .	1	1
1	found a _num_ star one _num_ minutes away for just about the same price .	1	1
1	i get the same meal constantly and pay different prices everytime .	1	1
1	the air did not function properly .	1	1
1	wrong it was smaller portions at a higher price .	1	1
1	the place is crowded and cramped too , but not unpleasant .	1	1
1	this place was southern food with zero flavor or heat .	1	1
1	for such a nice atmosphere its too bad the service was horrible .	1	1
1	this place is not worth the price .	1	1
1	6am is too early for her . ''	1	1
1	it was n't chicken , and it definitely did n't taste like chicken .	1	1
1	it was very bizarre !	1	1
1	the chowder was basically flour stew with potatoes .	1	1
1	my husband & i ate here a couple weeks ago for the first time .	1	1
1	i 'm skeptical though .	1	1
1	even the dipping sauce just tasted like soy sauce .	1	1
1	she was rude and careless .	1	1
1	the chicken was supposed to be grilled .	1	1
1	would rather go to dunkin donuts next time !	1	1
1	the drinks and salads are also soooo pricey .	1	1
1	when someone came in , they gave a bland generic greeting .	1	1
1	so , needless to say , not the best experience .	1	1
1	it 's really gone downhill lately .	1	1
1	and there are n't as many rest stops .	1	1
1	forget the fact that mcdonald 's food is n't great .	1	1
1	free bread : none .	1	1
1	this place is empty .	1	1
1	this place went from awesome to worst after it changed owners .	1	1
1	this spot would n't have lasted a year in nyc .	1	1
1	we did n't know if her reaction would be positive or negative .	1	1
1	you know , standard italian hoagie .	1	1
1	worst lunch experience of my life .	1	1
1	will not return ever .	1	1
1	when we checked out i spoke to manager & showed her my bites .	1	1
1	do not take your dog there to be groomed !	1	1
1	yet , he still drew blood and several yelled codes to the techs .	1	1
1	i could n't even see the shrimp underneath the thick crust of cajun seasoning .	1	1
1	the sweet and sour chicken looked like drops of hard , fried batter .	1	1
1	do n't get the salmon or tuna steak .	1	1
1	my server lost me towards the end .	1	1
1	the spread is average , quality of food and service unimpressive .	1	1
1	the snack was another problem .	1	1
1	horrible front desk service !	1	1
1	haha , i was being totally sarcastic .	1	1
1	the lo mien tasted way too greasy and was flavorless .	1	1
1	i would be careful ordering food here .	1	1
1	i have had better and i have had worse .	1	1
1	a complete waste of $ _num_ .	1	1
1	slowest drive thru in charlotte .	1	1
1	do n't be fooled by the outside because the outside is n't too bad .	1	1
1	an extra large pizza was so small it barely fed my wife and i .	1	1
1	but seriously _num_ min for a slice of quiche and a breakfast sandwich ?	1	1
1	steam rice on the other hand is free ( which i picked ) .	1	1
1	my room was smoke free yet it reeked of smoke and a horrible smell .	1	1
1	go for the top tier steak ... steer clear of apps .	1	1
1	egg roll and fried rice is too greasy .	1	1
1	my date ordered a hot sausage hoagie .	1	1
1	and i 've been marriott platinum for _num_ years !	1	1
1	i just ate half of a cockroach .	1	1
1	we tried it again tonight for our anniversary dinner .	1	1
1	very disappointed .	1	1
1	he literally walked around the restaurant to find someone , but could n't .	1	1
1	the garden veggie soup is watery , not recommended .	1	1
1	the only restaurant that gave me so rude , unprofessional answer ever !	1	1
1	the seasoning was weak .	1	1
1	no one .	1	1
1	the hot and sour soup is exactly that .	1	1
1	to put it short , they should have just sent her home .	1	1
1	as for me , i do n't think i 'll be back .	1	1
1	... seriously , how does one even mess that up ?	1	1
1	the service was atrocious and incredibly slow .	1	1
1	we had carpet , and the oldest , white appliances i have ever seen .	1	1
1	i never used the sauna , so i can not comment on that .	1	1
1	nothing special on this menu ... .	1	1
1	all we ordered was a pasta , breadsticks and desert .	1	1
1	the beans and rice were not much better .	1	1
1	i 'm totally confused .	1	1
1	what i really did n't like about this place was the service .	1	1
1	my husband let me try a bite of his rueben which was really good .	1	1
1	very disappointed in this place .	1	1
1	the slowest and worst quality bojangles in the history of the franchise .	1	1
1	i ordered the chicken parm pasta and got it to go to my room .	1	1
1	it was a horrible experience .	1	1
1	stay away unless you have extra money for cold food and bad service .	1	1
1	the waiter never did refill my water glass .	1	1
1	if i had known that i would n't have added the second driver .	1	1
1	my favorite sauce was the honey jalapeno .	1	1
1	their chicken sandwich was ordinary and the fries came out a little cold .	1	1
1	will not return here .	1	1
1	this place seems to have gone downhill since last time .	1	1
1	very bad experience .	1	1
1	i had made the reservation several weeks prior , with guaranteed late arrival .	1	1
1	wo n't be going back .	1	1
1	worst service ever .	1	1
1	what we had was just okay -- but barely .	1	1
1	if i could give this particular applebee 's _num_ stars i would .	1	1
1	i had an ugly haircut .	1	1
1	while sitting there we noticed _num_ other parties walked out as well .	1	1
1	horrible place .	1	1
1	unsatisfied customer !	1	1
1	baked ziti average .	1	1
1	there was absolutely no hot water for my shower .	1	1
1	i will never go back to this place , to many other options uptown .	1	1
1	bad decision .	1	1
1	it was just okay as a whole .	1	1
1	however , i 'm in pittsburgh , where can i go ?	1	1
1	so many fountains , open areas , gardens to visit .	1	1
1	_num_ more minutes for drinks , and to order .	1	1
1	will not go back .	1	1
1	rude cashiers .	1	1
1	nah ... why bother when there are so many other options around .	1	1
1	it was not good .	1	1
1	as politely as i could .	1	1
1	horrible food , horrible service .	1	1
1	_num_ dress shirt .	1	1
1	horrible experience and not worth the money .	1	1
1	for all the hype this was very disappointing .	1	1
1	i switched it to another outlet , and , again , no charge .	1	1
1	my aunt thought she went on a break and did n't bother telling us .	1	1
1	ok , but they do not go out of their way to help !	1	1
1	disappointed !	1	1
1	tossed me out for no good reason .	1	1
1	no effort at all to help me out .	1	1
1	i was uncomfortable the majority of the time i was there .	1	1
1	tiger wood drinks were very tasty .	1	1
1	changed too seem to be the quality of the steaks .	1	1
1	fist we wait _num_ mins or so to be seated .	1	1
1	what the hell ?	1	1
1	gross .	1	1
1	did n't seem handmade or anything like that .	1	1
1	first of all , the gym in pretty cheap .	1	1
1	there is no tomorrow .	1	1
1	i would like to see some attempt to carry more high end products .	1	1
1	very bad purchase experience .	1	1
1	finally got seated and waited _num_ minutes for waters and then ate mediocre food .	1	1
1	this is why i chose them to begin with as stated about .	1	1
1	the sandwich was soggy , bland , and just all-around not good .	1	1
1	we will not be going back .	1	1
1	i do n't need anything fancy but this was pathetic .	1	1
1	they only good thing is the crowded airport van !	1	1
1	valet another _num_ .	1	1
1	at that point , she said i 'll grab you water and bread .	1	1
1	it 's just not enough to keep us coming anymore .	1	1
1	concord nc location : do n't go there !	1	1
1	the texture is far too gooey for my liking .	1	1
1	neither of us had cash on us , ( umm ... sorry ? )	1	1
1	i did n't want to talk to the manager .	1	1
1	was not good at all .	1	1
1	the games that did give you tickets were cheap as hell .	1	1
1	do n't be fooled !	1	1
1	please do not patronize this business .	1	1
1	good chinese takeout here , seems to be hard to find .	1	1
1	the sauce was disappointing .	1	1
1	i wo n't be back .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	it literally tasted and looked like everything came out of a old can .	1	1
1	previous reviews have said it well : lackluster , tasteless food .	1	1
1	a drive thru is suppose a little quicker service of getting your food .	1	1
1	not a quiet hotel at anytime of the day .	1	1
1	the service was mostly friendly but i was disappointed in my meal .	1	1
1	i wo n't be back .	1	1
1	`` it 's not coming off !	1	1
1	on top of that , none of the shrimp had been cleaned .	1	1
1	not at this location , at least .	1	1
1	wait staff is not trained .	1	1
1	do not go here -- find another dentist .	1	1
1	the chef was entertaining but the food was n't very good .	1	1
1	anywhere remotely healthy or yummy looking had an insane line .	1	1
1	i ordered it without lettuce , tomato , onions , or dressing .	1	1
1	sat at the bar at about _num_ saturday for appetizers and drinks .	1	1
1	they brought the wrong one again .	1	1
1	this lunch kinda sucked .	1	1
1	i 've only been here _num_ months and i 'm miserable .	1	1
1	the waitress did offer to get the fried rice .	1	1
1	unfortunately it will have to be another _num_ years before i try it .	1	1
1	low quality food but the $ _num_ lunch special makes it worth it .	1	1
1	strike _num_ .	1	1
1	apparently this was a bad choice .	1	1
1	probably the worst bbq food i 've ever had .	1	1
1	after waiting for 5-10 minutes , she went back to the sales person .	1	1
1	i 'm completely disappointed , i ordered my mother-in-law flowers for her birthday .	1	1
1	trash .	1	1
1	this place is sort of gross .	1	1
1	he had my money and had no more use for me .	1	1
1	unfortunately within _num_ days one of the diamonds on the halo was missing .	1	1
1	the waitress who seemed to be rushed did not offer any recommendations .	1	1
1	the service was not so great .	1	1
1	i did n't eat it .	1	1
1	sadly , this is the only pizza hut near me .	1	1
1	they hardly put any fresh vegetables in it , and the vermicelli is overcooked .	1	1
1	so , yeah , the smell .	1	1
1	def split it and get ice cream for dessert somewhere else .	1	1
1	i ended up getting probably the worst haircut i 'd had in _num_ years .	1	1
1	service was very bad today .	1	1
1	_num_ minutes in , he finally gets our drink orders .	1	1
1	it makes no sense .	1	1
1	i tried dean 's because i had a coupon for a free hair cut .	1	1
1	i ordered the kung pao chicken and crab rangoon .	1	1
1	the bun was firm like it was quite old .	1	1
1	what type of pizza could possibly take over two hours ?	1	1
1	many great chinese restaurants around , this is not one .	1	1
1	seems like our waitress had n't told her .	1	1
1	you do n't have to have people in the kitchen who act like that .	1	1
1	overall we were very disappointed , especially with the good reviews we had read .	1	1
1	i got there just to try the new triple steak sandwich .	1	1
1	not cool .	1	1
1	the portions are way too small and not good at all .	1	1
1	the dining room breakfast was served in was tacky and the coffee awful .	1	1
1	noisy overcrowded and not enough staff to cover the crowd so service was slow .	1	1
1	it was n't even crowded .	1	1
1	the soda machine was broken .	1	1
1	this place was by far the worst place i 've ever lived .	1	1
1	sure i will be back , but with lower expectations .	1	1
1	they tried to fix the broken telephone but were n't really successful .	1	1
1	this is by far the worst ups store i have dealt with .	1	1
1	i do n't like this place , nor the food .	1	1
1	Negative	1	1
1	this mcdonalds is straight crap .	1	1
1	they do n't seem to care too much .	1	1
1	the waitress was rude and less than helpful .	1	1
1	he did not even offer to make an appointment after his busy time .	1	1
1	why were n't their any ice in the glass ?	1	1
1	their service is a hot mess !	1	1
1	his level of customer service was appalling .	1	1
1	it seem to be over before it started .	1	1
1	it 's like a bad applebee 's .	1	1
1	my silver was even wrapped in torn linens !	1	1
1	but it certainly is sub-par .	1	1
1	most of the time , they 're downright rude .	1	1
1	i got a huge hot pepper that burnt the crap out of my lip .	1	1
1	i wo n't be going here again .	1	1
1	i was very disappointed !	1	1
1	i 'm used to airports in cali where every seat has a charger .	1	1
1	stupid .	1	1
1	the food was barely warm .	1	1
1	seriously , terrible .	1	1
1	not edible .	1	1
1	ambiance , like i said , left much to be desired .	1	1
1	probably will only go back for take out .	1	1
1	i recently posted a photo of my chicken ranch club .	1	1
1	avoid this place if you have the option .	1	1
1	ive stayed here about _num_ times over the past 4-5 years .	1	1
1	( old cereal and bread . )	1	1
1	no `` thank you '' or `` have a good day '' .	1	1
1	weak leadership .	1	1
1	there was no attendant at the booth when we left .	1	1
1	finally , _num_ mins later ... that 's one hour , folks .	1	1
1	just opened them up an poured .	1	1
1	gross !	1	1
1	this is by far the worst thai restaurant i 've ever been to .	1	1
1	then no , i have not gotten my beer .	1	1
1	no no no .	1	1
1	when i told people i was going to pittsburgh , everyone recommended primanti bros .	1	1
1	after dinner we went on the deck so my daughter could feed the ducks .	1	1
1	i heard her talking about customers very badly .	1	1
1	i will not go back .	1	1
1	i love bbb ; however , this location is terrible .	1	1
1	_num_ - put the drink prices on the website too .	1	1
1	do not do business with this company .	1	1
1	should have taken the other reviews to heart as i had a similar experience !	1	1
1	we sat and waited for more than _num_ minutes .	1	1

1	the crab stuffing was mostly stuffing .	1	1
1	dear pittsburgh , we are foodies from boston .	1	1
1	the almond torte used to be the best , hands down .	1	1
1	we ordered the turkey reuben that tasted funky on day old potato pancakes .	1	1
1	this walgreens is dreadful to go to .	1	1
1	they were just sitting down doing nothing .	1	1
1	let 's face it , this is not japanese food .	1	1
1	customer service was seriously lacking .	1	1
1	this is the worst .	1	1
1	i do n't mind them being cash only .	1	1
1	yuck i have avoided this subway like the plague .	1	1
1	it 's a shame but both of the things i had heard were correct .	1	1
1	i was not only disappointed , but frustrated and angry .	1	1
1	mmm not too happy with my recent experience at harris grill .	1	1
1	corn bread mediocre , overall it was okay .	1	1
1	crispy noodles were stale .	1	1
1	the bottom and the top rated with grease .	1	1
1	zero flavor and the mushrooms were canned .	1	1
1	the food was just mediocre .	1	1
1	it was very noisy and i do not recommend for kids .	1	1
1	i highly doubt we will be returning to this restaurant .	1	1
1	does zero good to complain .	1	1

1	not impressed .	1	1
1	five guy burgers much better .	1	1
1	the miso soup was hot but the taste only average .	1	1
1	it turned into a giant mess .	1	1
1	listen folks , it 's cold when the sun goes down .	1	1
1	the staff and management are rude and only want money .	1	1
1	and the chicken was very dry .	1	1
1	i would give it zero stars if i could .	1	1

1	i do n't feel bad .	1	1
1	not particularly interested in returning for any reason .	1	1
1	i had to wait in the lobby for hours .	1	1
1	_num_ cents ?	1	1

1	i got tired of trying to flag someone down all evening .	1	1
1	i never felt so ripped off .	1	1
1	the food was not good .	1	1
1	not likely to try again though .	1	1
1	both the waitress and the bartender were extremely rude .	1	1
1	do n't waste your time here , try a local place instead !	1	1
1	the website clearly stated the restaurant closed at 10pm .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	i will not return to this place again .	1	1
1	i 'm just not that excited for my lunch .	1	1
1	the pot roast by comparison had no flavor whatsoever .	1	1
1	as soon as we got off the shuttle things turned unorganized .	1	1
1	for a sandwich advertised to have delicious bacon , this fell way short .	1	1
1	i will not be back !	1	1
1	what a disappointing easter dinner .	1	1
1	goat cheese - this was without a doubt my favorite of anything all night .	1	1
1	no offer to adjust my membership so i ask for $ _num_ refund .	1	1

1	ca n't justify going back ... .	1	1
1	the old guy continued to drink wine and yelled at another waitress .	1	1
1	_num_ degrees , line out the door , and no ac .	1	1
1	personally , i do n't see what is so special about it .	1	1
1	worst .	1	1
1	especially for a single lady i would seriously avoid .	1	1
1	so i was like dang !	1	1
1	did n't live up to my expectations at all .	1	1
1	waitress was rude to them and the manager never came to address the issue .	1	1
1	watch the dried bulk stuff - it 's old and stale .	1	1
1	what kind of deli runs out of meat and white bread ?	1	1
1	negatives : the lighting , the decor and the smoking .	1	1
1	gross , gross , gross !	1	1
1	while my portion was sufficient , there was nothing spectacular about the lasagna .	1	1
1	the first half dragged .	1	1
1	nothing was the way i ordered it !	1	1
1	just basic chinese food .	1	1
1	this after they brought her the absolute wrong order .	1	1
1	the breakfast area was incredibly crowded .	1	1
1	bad customer service they just do not care at this location .	1	1
1	disappointed .	1	1
1	the manager then pushed a full set of tires my way for $ _num_ .	1	1
1	fried items arrive a little on the cold and soggy side .	1	1
1	the entire experience was certainly below my expectations .	1	1
1	it 's a shame , because it was a beautiful gift .	1	1
1	i walked into the store at _num_ minutes to 8pm .	1	1
1	i woke up with a stuffy nose and in need of some hot soup .	1	1

1	the worst customer service by server and manager .	1	1
1	there were also plenty of empty tables .	1	1
1	the bread is _num_ % of the meal .	1	1
1	the bagels were chewy and my son could hardly tear his with his teeth .	1	1
1	too bad , jared 's .	1	1
1	the bed was hard as rocks and very uncomfortable .	1	1
1	we wo n't return here .	1	1
1	not a great presentation of the dining area .	1	1
1	not comparable to the other top ten pizza joints in pittsburgh .	1	1
1	service is terrible and wo n't return .	1	1
1	i know , i know -- olive garden , how pedestrian of me !	1	1
1	horrible .	1	1
1	it was theory tasteless love me in i 've ever eaten .	1	1
1	our room overlooked the pool , and some of charlotte .	1	1
1	i walked into the store looking for yellow flowers .	1	1
1	but i 'd suggest you not !	1	1
1	how were _num_ people in the _num_ seat restaurant and one small takeout order .	1	1
1	terrible service .	1	1
1	terrible value but the steaks were good .	1	1
1	greyhound is a nightmare !	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	requested a meeting and no one showed up .	1	1
1	what i got was a very dry and tasteless sandwich .	1	1
1	i 'm beyond disgusted .	1	1
1	however , the food ... .	1	1
1	also , the staff was fairly rude and all had chips on their shoulders .	1	1
1	there were several things that got me annoyed , one after another .	1	1
1	extremely long lines , and poorly trained staff .	1	1
1	ordered from them only because they were open and delivered after 10pm .	1	1
1	she was definitely old enough to understand why she was wrong .	1	1
1	limited menu .	1	1
1	when we got back to our hotel .	1	1
1	no , just no .	1	1
1	there was seriously nothing remotely healthy on this menu .	1	1
1	_num_ ) red beans rice and sausage was not good .	1	1
1	the juice from the tacos also made the tater tots extremely soggy .	1	1
1	the chicken tasted like mystery meat .	1	1
1	i would stay away from these shady dealers .	1	1
1	and it all is so bad .	1	1
1	then i waited another _num_ minutes for them to get me my food .	1	1
1	while tasty , the portions are small .	1	1
1	not like the delicious aroma of fresh brewed coffee .	1	1
1	the eggs i ordered scrambled and they were too dry for me .	1	1
1	do n't try to pretend you 're something else .	1	1
1	asked for risotto and got some pasta , not sure what .	1	1
1	i ordered the seabass and it really was n't anything spectacular .	1	1
1	horrible , rude service .	1	1
1	not worth the $ _num_ .	1	1
1	it was truly , truly just plain sad .	1	1
1	lidia should be embarrassed .	1	1
1	pizza was fine but nothing special .	1	1
1	the coupon was spend _num_ , get _num_ off .	1	1
1	( _num_ ) free breakfast but there is no mixing it up ... ... .	1	1
1	needless to say i do n't think i will be returning .	1	1
1	i ordered a side salad and it was all iceberg lettuce .	1	1
1	i poured my own wine refills .	1	1
1	the owner clearly has no idea how to cut curly hair .	1	1
1	that 's why they hide the _num_ mins warning out of plan site .	1	1
1	i would not go back for any reason .	1	1
1	unless you want to catch a disease .	1	1
1	i will never go back to total bond .	1	1
1	the place was so disgusting that i had to look up their restaurant rating .	1	1
1	i 've gotten my nails done quickly before though and had much better quality .	1	1
1	obviously , if you choose to patronize this establishment , pay cash .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	they were suppose to be baby backs but they were dry .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	i ai n't going back where they treat customers like that .	1	1
1	after the installation , lowe 's would refund us the $ _num_ .	1	1
1	this place just bored me .	1	1
1	i wanted them to , but they just did n't .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	_num_ were supposed to be in an order but they only delivered _num_ .	1	1
1	it was $ _num_ for a standard pulled pork plate with a drink .	1	1
1	the shrimp in my dish were the really small cheap shrimp .	1	1
1	finally the entrees come and low and behold my pasta is the regular way .	1	1
1	no time to get additional fabric .	1	1
1	good cheap food .	1	1
1	i ordered a platter with no sausage as i dont eat meat .	1	1
1	as another reviewer said it was set up weird .	1	1
1	would not go back and would not recommend this place to anyone .	1	1
1	for pamela 's , we gave it a shot .	1	1
1	the spinach pie was ok .	1	1
1	this company 's contract is very frustrating to work with .	1	1
1	first of all , ordering was strange .	1	1
1	the mexican cookie was just the same consistency .	1	1
1	my girlfriend ordered sesame chicken and it tasted like fish .	1	1
1	_num_ hour later i came back and waited _num_ min again .	1	1
1	none offered .	1	1
1	no thanks , much better candy shops around the city .	1	1
1	terrible !	1	1
1	take it from a five star gold member : avoid this location if possible .	1	1
1	needless to say we left , and we will not be going back .	1	1
1	it is impossible get from a to b outside or inside the place .	1	1
1	avoid at all costs .	1	1
1	service is bad when you enter .	1	1
1	alot of better options uptown .	1	1
1	but i placed the order online , then i am on hold again .	1	1
1	has gotten worse .	1	1
1	the customer service here is horrible .	1	1
1	do not make the mistake and eat here .	1	1
1	and rude staff .	1	1
1	not a good first impression .	1	1
1	it seems ridiculous , actually .	1	1
1	very rude and once they get paid have no ethics .	1	1
1	the food here was just adequate .	1	1
1	very bad service .	1	1
1	do n't waste your money .	1	1
1	there was no salad or pasta side offered .	1	1
1	upon arriving the service was ridiculous .	1	1
1	this place is a bad idea all around .	1	1
1	wrong !	1	1
1	the food selection is basically wings , burgers and pizza .	1	1
1	it 's really too bad because as i said , her collection looks lovely .	1	1
1	service here is pretty bad .	1	1
1	no way would i ever stay at this motel again .	1	1
1	since we had to drive _num_ min with limited time not worth the wait .	1	1
1	party involved said it was fine and asked me not to say something .	1	1
1	the waitstaff saw what was happening and did n't care at all .	1	1
1	they do n't care about anyone .	1	1
1	do not take your car here unless you want something messed up !	1	1
1	overall , kind of an irritating experience .	1	1
1	the cab was taking forever , so we called a different company .	1	1
1	the room i stayed in was old and run down .	1	1
1	the balsamic vinaigrette was straight vinegar .	1	1
1	the only good part was the bacon , which was ok at best .	1	1
1	i 'm genuinely disappointed with the recent changes .	1	1
1	red curry was very thin , which should not be the case .	1	1
1	but with all of the strange behavior , attempts to scam us , etc .	1	1
1	maybe i am spoiled but in every p.f .	1	1
1	was told it would be _num_ hours for a delivery .	1	1
1	do not buy this couch !	1	1
1	so from that day forward , i started to patronize them less .	1	1
1	i 've tried a lot of pizza places and this is so bad .	1	1
1	the bar is ok , the food is ok , it 's nothing special .	1	1
1	i do n't really have a good review for this place .	1	1
1	rating is really _num_ and based upon the beers sampled .	1	1
1	i pushed the dish off to the side and settled for my potato .	1	1
1	and questioned why it was cold .	1	1
1	wish i would have read yelp first .	1	1
1	just skip this one and you will be better off .	1	1
1	even homemade wine and honey soaked cake wo n't bring me back again .	1	1
1	we will not be back .	1	1
1	got up and walked out .	1	1
1	to date the store has done nothing to replace the defective furniture .	1	1
1	we ordered the burgers and they were dry & barely edible .	1	1
1	i also ordered the southwestern turkey burger .	1	1
1	meat was not cooked properly and was very chewy .	1	1
1	and walked away .	1	1
1	it was just embarrassing to new orleans .	1	1
1	finally they allowed me to put down cash .	1	1
1	did n't she have my slip with the card number ?	1	1
1	there is much better mexican food and drink in the 'burgh .	1	1
1	terrible !	1	1
1	do not stay here if you have a choice .	1	1
1	you do n't even bake the pizza !	1	1
1	and _num_ % of the time your order is wrong .	1	1
1	something tells me there is better seafood out there in charlotte .	1	1
1	when we called they said no payment , no dogs .	1	1
1	does not honor national sub day offer .	1	1
1	fool me -- you ca n't get fooled again . ''	1	1
1	i wo n't be going back .	1	1
1	not here .	1	1
1	once again , they were not prompt .	1	1
1	ps the maintenance staff are fabulous and deserve _num_ stars !	1	1
1	never going back .	1	1
1	after arriving back at the hotel , bedding had not been changed .	1	1
1	i really do n't understand the hype of this place .	1	1
1	ultimately , i was n't very impressed .	1	1
1	too many other competent companies to model after .	1	1
1	the restaurant was practically empty on a sunday afternoon when we met .	1	1
1	not sure about this place .	1	1
1	did n't like it !	1	1
1	this was n't the cleanest place .	1	1
1	my husband can not go back to construction junction today .	1	1
1	not warm , not luke warm , cold !	1	1
1	my cashier never handed me a cup for my drink .	1	1
1	we ended up tipping and not making a fuss ... just another lesson learned .	1	1
1	how sad is this so not happy .	1	1
1	very very disappointed by how this place accompanied us .	1	1
1	there was also some take-out business at the same time .	1	1
1	the rice was flavorless .	1	1
1	i sent their management a message , but have not yet heard back .	1	1
1	too over priced for mani and pedi .	1	1
1	she left about 1-2 inches of my naturally black roots !	1	1
1	seriously , the youngest person there was in their early _num_ 's .	1	1
1	awesome !	1	1
1	i have had a meatball sub and stuffed shells and they are both ok .	1	1
1	thai tea was no bueno .	1	1
1	unacceptable .	1	1
1	one did n't even look up from the computer .	1	1
1	i 'll probably never go back again .	1	1
1	not one said i will be your server i will be with you shortly .	1	1
1	these hoagies are the most pathetic hoagies i 've ever seen or eaten !	1	1
1	it is difficult to get in and out of their lot as well .	1	1
1	but the last three times the staff has been awful .	1	1
1	we also ended up with _num_ waitresses .	1	1
1	not worth wasting your time .	1	1
1	no meat in any of the _num_ pastas .	1	1
1	no way you 're actually getting either of those meats in the dishes .	1	1
1	go to a better cajun restaurant , this one is not worth your money .	1	1
1	very poor experience .	1	1
1	the collard greens had an excessive amount of uncooked onions and tomatoes .	1	1
1	i will never return , to make any other purchases .	1	1
1	the beer makes everything tastes better so order at least two beers before eating .	1	1
1	i wish i could give this no stars !	1	1
1	the only reason we left was because we felt entirely , completely unwelcome .	1	1
1	the restaurant never called us , so we ended up eating elsewhere .	1	1
1	this place is bad !	1	1
1	the pizza was flavorless and the crust tasted like cardboard .	1	1
1	good groupon deal but terrible food - will not be back .	1	1
1	there are much better italian restaurants in pittsburgh .	1	1
1	we had no problems using our admission ticket or parking ticket .	1	1
1	the food ( breakfast ) was ok .	1	1
1	salad was average at best .	1	1
1	we talked to the manager i 'm assuming which did n't really care .	1	1
1	but as i ate , i was even more disappointed .	1	1
1	there is an atm , but it has a $ _num_ charge to use .	1	1
1	we sat outside and the service was very slow .	1	1
1	not only has the quality dropped , the service is horrible .	1	1
1	it took us nearly _num_ minutes to get our food .	1	1
1	talk about a nasty look and attitude .	1	1
1	unfortunately the worst possible thing has happened .	1	1
1	what was set in front me looked nothing like what i was used to .	1	1
1	finally , i find one after _num_ minutes of wondering around .	1	1
1	if you can help it , do n't get cable from this cable company .	1	1
1	it took another _num_ minutes before he actually got the pizza .	1	1
1	why every time i come in here , it 's really hot ?	1	1
1	they are too pricy as well .	1	1
1	what a huge disappointment .	1	1
1	looks like we will stick with flying biscuit !	1	1
1	way too much cheese .	1	1
1	the fried chicken was pretty bland .	1	1
1	i would be hard pressed to ever return .	1	1
1	the customers do n't make the experience any better .	1	1
1	the fried chicken was straight forward .	1	1
1	however , it all went down hill from there .	1	1
1	i do n't think we will come here any time again too soon .	1	1
1	sorry , not sorry .	1	1
1	no potatoes or any other filling except a few peas .	1	1
1	it 's like they are trying to make the ghetto look classy .	1	1
1	we had to flag down another server to get our toast .	1	1
1	btw they ordered chicken strips and fries so not very hard to make .	1	1
1	ugh .	1	1
1	i read somewhere that charlotte has the highest time warner rates in the country .	1	1
1	in a considerably nasty tone .	1	1
1	all of our baked potatoes were hard and cold .	1	1
1	mainly because the service was horrible .	1	1
1	$ _num_ for a regular size barbecue plate and a ice water !	1	1
1	will take my business elsewhere in the future .	1	1
1	i think one star is being highly generous for this restaurant .	1	1
1	it was dry , not at all crispy , and had no flavor .	1	1
1	will never go back !	1	1
1	do not stay here .	1	1
1	i ca n't even rate this place !	1	1
1	swing and miss .	1	1
1	if i could give zero stars i would .	1	1
1	bottom line is poor excuses for terrible work .	1	1
1	i was greeted by a friendly hostess and seated at a comfy booth .	1	1
1	in the meantime , date was unimpressed with the chicken .	1	1
1	he refuses .	1	1
1	maybe i should cut down on the costco dogs ?	1	1
1	bottom line is , do n't do it .	1	1
1	no thanks casbah !	1	1
1	i would hate it , but she likes a firm mattress .	1	1
1	hands down the worst drive thru experience of my life .	1	1
1	my boyfriend had their philly cheesesteak and he could n't finish it .	1	1
1	he was n't satisfied at all .	1	1
1	waiter was not thrilled to be at work on a wednesday at 5pm .	1	1
1	some rude nasty woman answers the phone !	1	1
1	if you 're in a hurry , do n't come here .	1	1
1	fyi - prices are scheduled to go up jan _num_ _num_ .	1	1
1	the entrees are horrible .	1	1
1	this is something that tram 's has gotten badly wrong every time i visited .	1	1
1	)	1	1
1	double swiss burger was as tasteless as they could make .	1	1
1	but , our waitress was helpful , and our food came out pretty quickly .	1	1
1	i ordered an avocado chicken caesar salad .	1	1
1	i probably would n't go back .	1	1
1	i found all of this very unacceptable .	1	1
1	the wings and cheese fries were disgusting .	1	1
1	i also plan to tell my family and friends not to shop here .	1	1
1	again the curry fried rice is not authentic neither .	1	1
1	just bad service .	1	1
1	tried to pressure me into buying a bed right then and there .	1	1
1	overall the rent keeps going up every year and their service just getting worse .	1	1
1	i asked her for honey mustard , she didnt even hear me .	1	1
1	the caribou associates know how to treat customers .	1	1
1	appalling !	1	1
1	Positive	1	1
1	wo n't be going back .	1	1
1	i had a horrible experience .	1	1
1	duck curry was okay .	1	1
1	the show was bad .	1	1
1	for some odd reason , local aaa offices dont post their phone number online ?	1	1
1	bad mistake .	1	1
1	well everything was kinda disappointing .	1	1
1	the last two pair did n't come out right .	1	1
1	the crab cakes were definitely frozen , and not made from blue crab .	1	1
1	i do n't return on principle .	1	1
1	also , the flight was delayed ... how long ?	1	1
1	lame .	1	1
1	tried again today with my husband , nope .	1	1
1	do not insult your customers bc you recognize a ny accent .	1	1
1	terrible service .	1	1
1	i was disappointed after reading all the positive reviews .	1	1
1	i could n't tell the difference .	1	1
1	this is not the first time i 've been hard up to find help .	1	1
1	there were _num_ slices of pepperoni on it .	1	1
1	but damn , i was hungry !	1	1
1	we ran to the gate and there was no one there and no plane .	1	1
1	these people rip you off !	1	1
1	why even keep this historical , old , dingy , dirty room ?	1	1
1	the baked potato was awful and the service was mediocre .	1	1
1	no in this restaurant are polite .	1	1
1	they need to find new wait staff who are attentive and friendly !	1	1
1	they ca n't make an authentic antipasto .	1	1
1	we stayed at the shadyside inn for months and spent thousands of dollars .	1	1
1	kitchen does not care .	1	1
1	i 'm shocked , never thought men 's dress clothes were so pricey .	1	1
1	flavorless , undercooked , and late .	1	1
1	spent $ _num_ on a new pair of glasses and they did n't fit .	1	1
1	i will not recommend anyone to go to the park .	1	1
1	i had the scallops with stir fried vegetables .	1	1
1	bedding was stained on pillow and comforter .	1	1
1	never going back !	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	this was the worst experience i ever had with business owners !	1	1
1	the only flavors were vinegar and pepper .	1	1
1	`` hello , sir .	1	1
1	so disappointed .	1	1
1	returning to the buffet , my wife said the shrimp was very salty .	1	1
1	just go anywhere else , it ca n't be worse !	1	1
1	not a big fan of this place .	1	1
1	all working hard , but covering too many tables .	1	1
1	it 's been _num_ minutes since i first ordered .	1	1
1	`` every christmas story ever told '' was slow and not that funny .	1	1
1	i would not go out of my way or tell friends about this place .	1	1
1	no worries probably better for me .	1	1
1	but it 's soooooo bland !	1	1
1	if you like horseradish go for it , if not stay away .	1	1
1	nothing special .	1	1
1	there were fruit flies everywhere .	1	1
1	i waited until _num_ and knocked normally so that it would be heard .	1	1
1	i get the location is close but it is not worth the grief .	1	1
1	overall , my experience eating here has been inconsistent .	1	1
1	all in all , very disappointing in our book .	1	1
1	not to mention my allergies were in full effect .	1	1
1	really tasteless and not good .	1	1
1	but it was nothing special .	1	1
1	do they have a corporate taste kitchen ?	1	1
1	my poor baby went through hell .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	then they offered me the sale at _num_ which they claimed was their cost .	1	1
1	i didnt taste any alcohol .	1	1
1	dishonest staff ruined it for me .	1	1
1	gave it _num_ stars cause the wait staff was nice .	1	1
1	such a shame .	1	1
1	i could n't taste salt , pepper , garlic , anything .	1	1
1	i am in search of a new salon definitely !	1	1
1	i very rarely walk out of a restaurant with out having eaten first .	1	1
1	the pizza was n't bad , but it was n't great either .	1	1
1	please do yourself a favor and avoid this airport .	1	1
1	he thought they would `` stay too long '' .	1	1
1	it 's not theirs to make sure it work .	1	1
1	$ _num_ pedicure should have been way better than it was .	1	1
1	it should have been a clue when they were soggy .	1	1
1	all in all this place is n't that bad .	1	1
1	i will not stay here again and do not recommend it for business travelers .	1	1
1	this is a standard gas station and not really worth reviewing .	1	1
1	pathetic , no other way to describe this brunch .	1	1
1	the food sucked !	1	1
1	overpriced , salty and overrated !	1	1
1	then , before i was able to say anything , they broke in .	1	1
1	the food was lousy .	1	1
1	first , the area is sketchy at best .	1	1
1	cocktails were good but menu is very overpriced .	1	1
1	it was disgusting .	1	1
1	it sure is n't the food .	1	1
1	very disappointing to me .	1	1
1	it 's loud as hell !	1	1
1	our drinks were refilled often without being asked .	1	1
1	a few simple items turned into a large bill .	1	1
1	and the beer menu was mediocre , at best .	1	1
1	suggestions , maybe do a little housekeeping .	1	1
1	this is not one of them .	1	1
1	horrible showers , but nice folks .	1	1
1	when i mean thin , i mean thin enough to see through the slice !	1	1
1	ordered delivery food took two hours and was cold .	1	1
1	do not book a rental car through national .	1	1
1	however , the sucker that i am for a deal , i got it .	1	1
1	i wo n't go back .	1	1
1	panda 's den in north charlotte puts this place to shame .	1	1
1	my first impression was the outdated decor .	1	1
1	we just turned around and walked out at that point .	1	1
1	the collards were not cook well and my salmon patties were burnt .	1	1
1	while that was decent , it was n't exciting either .	1	1
1	it was bad ... the you ca n't drink it kind of bad .	1	1
1	all the other food seems very commercial and lacks flavor .	1	1
1	this was my second time staying at this hotel with the same problem .	1	1
1	we ai n't got no hashbrowns !	1	1
1	with _num_ waitresses .	1	1
1	gross !	1	1
1	they just keep finding excuses and trying not to be responsible for it .	1	1
1	it has n't been cleaned in months .	1	1
1	horrible place !	1	1
1	this stuff looked and tasted more like doughy noodles .	1	1
1	the frosty is never frosty always runny .	1	1
1	some of the worst service ever .	1	1
1	the entrees : $ _num_ - _num_ .	1	1
1	every item of food was really unimpressive .	1	1
1	terrible customer service !	1	1
1	i then start looking for a menu and there is none to be found .	1	1
1	i 'm just not impressed with their breakfast .	1	1
1	no bacon and barely any toppings .	1	1
1	i doubt we will go back , too many other choices .	1	1
1	not clean , either .	1	1
1	battered and fried .	1	1
1	veal parm was tough and so thin .	1	1
1	my cat is not eating .	1	1
1	needless to say we will never go there again .	1	1
1	the parking in this place is ridiculous .	1	1
1	i must be missing something because this place seemed expensive for dry cleaning .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	i just had the worst meal ever here .	1	1
1	she knew i would hate it but just did n't want to go alone .	1	1
1	yes the food is pretty bad .	1	1
1	we check in , we get the wrong room .	1	1
1	the food is pretty bad for an italian restaurant .	1	1
1	it was very rude .	1	1
1	so we 'll probably not ever go back .	1	1
1	you 'll get a sandwich with soggy fries and coleslaw on it .	1	1
1	)	1	1
1	when we said no she said she would be back .	1	1
1	no bueno , not for me .	1	1
1	no desk type chair .	1	1
1	the salad and steak sauce tasted like cleaner .	1	1
1	that was _num_ minutes of my life that i 'd like back .	1	1
1	it was dried and crusty like its been sitting out for too long .	1	1
1	never going back to a sleep inn again .	1	1
1	it tasted like it came out of a walmart freezer on clearance .	1	1
1	you 're giving nc bbq a bad rep .	1	1
1	i also like the white cheddar mash potatoes .	1	1
1	i only wish i had taken a picture of the buffet to prove it .	1	1
1	overpriced , very slow service , food was decent .	1	1
1	the night staff were very helpful and friendly however the morning staff were not .	1	1
1	so the max you could eat is _num_ wings .	1	1
1	dirty and nasty .	1	1
1	i 'm not a fan really .	1	1
1	i was not a fan and probably wo n't be back .	1	1
1	i 'd suggest to check everything before you leave the store .	1	1
1	on a scale of bad to good , it was kind of meh .	1	1
1	yeah , that place is that old and that outdated .	1	1
1	they went home hungry and very unhappy .	1	1
1	i hate to be negative .	1	1
1	i would n't go back .	1	1
1	from start to finish , this was a miserable experience .	1	1
1	never again will i spend money in this place .	1	1
1	i finally settled in my room , which was ok - nothing special .	1	1
1	you 're not doing as any favors by staying here .	1	1
1	absolutely the worst care in all my experience with vets !	1	1
1	terrible .	1	1
1	the flavor in the tiki masala was so bland .	1	1
1	there were maybe _num_ people there , all sitting at the bar .	1	1
1	went for mother 's day brunch and it was n't good at all .	1	1
1	also , parking was shit .	1	1
1	i should not be responsible for the bill .	1	1
1	grilled cheese , salad and a quesadilla should n't take that long .	1	1
1	the decor in the restaurant was nice though .	1	1
1	and is _num_ dollars a glass .	1	1
1	their texture was rubbery and they had a `` reheated '' taste to them .	1	1
1	was n't impressed by their sunday brunch .	1	1
1	and ... i was pretty underwhelmed .	1	1
1	they really are the only thing this place has going for it .	1	1
1	my wife ordered a chicken salad on pita , minus lettuce and tomatoes .	1	1
1	i would give him a _num_ start rating .	1	1
1	so rude and painfully slow .	1	1
1	i 'm not totally sure why i keep going back here .	1	1
1	my brisket was completely dry , as was the cornbread .	1	1
1	so i was in need of a lunch and off to the garden .	1	1
1	it looked like a child had done it .	1	1
1	$ _num_ for _num_ items is crazy !	1	1
1	i asked if she had pbr , and she replied she did n't know .	1	1
1	so incredibly frustrating !	1	1
1	do n't worry i did n't know about them until i came to wisconsin .	1	1
1	my hubby got sick off this food .	1	1
1	and i 've been to quite a few of those .	1	1
1	is this what italian food in pittsburgh has come too ?	1	1
1	if this is personalized service , i 'd rather stay at a motel .	1	1
1	parking sucks .	1	1
1	the pasta with chicken was about the best from the trio .	1	1
1	i will not be back .	1	1
1	the service staff are rude rude rude .	1	1
1	this was my first time trying brown bag deli too .	1	1
1	shame as it was one of our favorites .	1	1
1	try to avoid this location .	1	1
1	let me repeat , never again .	1	1
1	my collard greens was way too salty .	1	1
1	wrong again !	1	1
1	the sushi is very plain and not high quality either .	1	1
1	decided to give them another chance and was disappointed .	1	1
1	avoid the dirty dog if you can !	1	1
1	but since its _num_ guess they are closed .	1	1
1	we got garlic bread which was too thick and not enough butter .	1	1
1	i shop alot , sometimes too much .	1	1
1	it 's annoying .	1	1
1	food was meh , nothing special .	1	1
1	they use some oil which smell different that killed the taste of my pizza .	1	1
1	the store told them that they have problems with that manufacturer all the .	1	1
1	no i do n't want to pay you money for doing your job .	1	1
1	i 've never encountered a company with such an astounding lack of customer service .	1	1
1	this time we literally got sat at a table in the kitchen hallway .	1	1
1	rolls small lacking substance .	1	1
1	if you want no frills beer and bar food , they are no frills .	1	1
1	we did not feel any of these things .	1	1
1	needless to say i have crossed all hilton hotels off my traveling list .	1	1
1	wo n't visit again .	1	1
1	this place could have gotten a better score but for the service .	1	1
1	he said no to free upgrade .	1	1
1	i 'd have to say i was pretty disappointed with my overall experience .	1	1
1	this rink just did n't blow my mind .	1	1
1	when the rest of our group arrived ( on time !	1	1
1	takeout is gross .	1	1
1	please do n't eat this food .	1	1
1	literally the worst apartment complex .	1	1
1	really horrible .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	it looked like one of those service elevators that the public never sees .	1	1
1	service is n't that great either .	1	1
1	on my second visit here , i had a very unpleasant experience .	1	1
1	and sushi is sushi is sushi if they are rolled correctly .	1	1
1	not sure what all the hype is about .	1	1
1	for an annual , the price was outrageous .	1	1
1	this is the worse nail salon i have ever been to !	1	1
1	it was just awful and the service was terrible .	1	1
1	the worst fried chicken ever .	1	1
1	i replied `` no , you never served me any . ''	1	1
1	rude front desk staff .	1	1
1	ive never had their food but ive heard its pretty decent .	1	1
1	terrible service !	1	1
1	a cut through the middle made it impossible to correct .	1	1
1	avoid this place at all costs .	1	1
1	heck no !	1	1
1	was n't very good at all ... .	1	1
1	the worst management team ever .	1	1
1	delivery is slow and not even close to the best chinese in the area .	1	1
1	not good .	1	1
1	i 've never been so horribly treated in my life .	1	1
1	needless to say , i will never go back to papa john 's again .	1	1
1	the steak was supposed to be medium ; instead it came well done .	1	1
1	any other kfc would be better .	1	1
1	the bread seemed really dried out and flavorless as well .	1	1
1	i mean , so so bad .	1	1
1	service was not in any rush .	1	1
1	nevertheless , this place in the westin hotel is no different .	1	1
1	i do n't hate anything on the harris grill menu .	1	1
1	do n't think i 'll be back .	1	1
1	this was a mistake .	1	1
1	so with tip a very disappointing mean cost me $ _num_ .	1	1
1	i will never go there again , and i recommend you do n't either .	1	1
1	absolutely no problems .	1	1
1	it 's hard to get a good chinese restaurant around pittsburgh .	1	1
1	i 'll spend my hard earned money where the food and service are better .	1	1
1	he also offered me a free lunch on the house which i turned down .	1	1
1	the technique of the haircut is so poor .	1	1
1	very rude and condescending .	1	1
1	unfortunately , the best part of this restaurant is the valet service .	1	1
1	the free pint glass & four samples were n't worth the $ _num_ .	1	1
1	down the street is a better option - wish they were open for lunch .	1	1
1	we made a reservation ( no need ) for 7pm on saturday .	1	1
1	customers are rude too .	1	1
1	they should n't even call it italian food .	1	1
1	our empty plates sat on our table for _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	selection of fruit is a little below average .	1	1
1	she said it was salty but the pasta was bland .	1	1
1	update - went back another time and the pizza was mediocre at best .	1	1
1	i lost out because the requested work was n't done .	1	1
1	finally , drivers range from super friendly to scary or just rude .	1	1
1	gone was the flavor and little taste of spicy burn at the end .	1	1
1	model cleaners failed to deliver _num_ shirts and _num_ suits in june .	1	1
1	sad to see it go .	1	1
1	worst place ever .	1	1
1	it is wrong .	1	1
1	john at the paint counter could use some customer service training .	1	1
1	they lost my breakfast business that day .	1	1
1	we were disappointed with our entrees .	1	1
1	other than losing your stuff , they seem like nice guys .	1	1
1	breakfast is cheap , and definitely very poor quality .	1	1
1	not worth $ _num_ unfortunately the sausage platter was $ _num_ .	1	1
1	i went there for a few grocery items along with some alcoholic beverages .	1	1
1	rude front desk staff .	1	1
1	the kitchen does not know the meaning of hospitality .	1	1
1	no thanks clt .	1	1
1	the chicken was flavorless and tough .	1	1
1	clearly she had a nasty cold and should 've stayed home that day !	1	1
1	our waiter was in no hurry to take care of us .	1	1
1	they told me that they charge _num_ dollars a hour .	1	1
1	i thought this was way too much .	1	1
1	definitely not staying there again .	1	1
1	i just dont know what it is .	1	1
1	my daughter ordered the fettuccine alfredo and it was quite bland .	1	1
1	my daughter 's drink order was wrong to start .	1	1
1	at other airports , the gates are in close proximity .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	the menu offerings were spotty .	1	1
1	i complained , they said sorry and that was it .	1	1
1	i did n't even know you could get canned green bell peppers .	1	1
1	my entree , the scallops served with risotto , was fine but overpriced .	1	1
1	it 's on the pricey side , but you probably know that already .	1	1
1	the food is moderately priced , but is too much for what you get .	1	1
1	not to mention , our order was wrong !	1	1
1	ugh unreal and frustrated to the tee !	1	1
1	no one in the room next to me , alarm clock goes off .	1	1
1	terrible experience !	1	1
1	i called to order contacts and they were utterly confused .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	for some reason , i found this airport to be kind of depressing .	1	1
1	try not to come here unless it 's for emergency .	1	1
1	i will not come for the second time .	1	1
1	parking nightmare .	1	1
1	it was a super rude way of dealing with that situation .	1	1
1	it did n't help that the ac was n't working while we ate .	1	1
1	should take _num_ minutes to get a nice cream cone .	1	1
1	either way , i do n't understand the hype surrounding this place .	1	1
1	be warned that everything here comes with french fries , even the salads .	1	1
1	_num_ mins .	1	1
1	i had very little meat in mine , and more coleslaw that anything else .	1	1
1	fifth problem : i called and emailed customer service about my charge .	1	1
1	the brown rice was mushy .	1	1
1	it 's expensive , the food is so so .	1	1
1	they charge about $ _num_ for a drink with no free refills .	1	1
1	lobster and potato cakes could have been better - too salty imo .	1	1
1	shame on you benihana .	1	1
1	so dissapointed and will never use them again .	1	1
1	the information for this restaurant needs to be updated !	1	1
1	then , she sat _num_ small parties there .	1	1
1	she took my bottle of wine and did not mention the price or anything .	1	1
1	as far as i know they are no longer open at this location .	1	1
1	let 's start with having a _num_ sanitation rating .	1	1
1	so they lost another star for over priced for the value i received .	1	1
1	not rib meat .	1	1
1	i would rate a _num_ .	1	1
1	we tried to nap but simply could n't .	1	1
1	and , the food is not up to par .	1	1
1	this was the worst `` pizza '' i 've ever had .	1	1
1	no apologies nothing .	1	1
1	fried rice : eggs , sesame seed , and soy sauce .	1	1
1	i lost money .	1	1
1	i sucked it up and ate the stupid beef .	1	1
1	there really is no big draw .	1	1
1	i 've been standing in line for _num_ min .	1	1
1	and it smells like a coffee shop should smell - like coffee .	1	1
1	the steak was cooked right but just did n't have much flavor .	1	1
1	i really could n't believe this .	1	1
1	_num_ stars : the food is terrible .	1	1
1	this crap has happened at least _num_ times in a row !	1	1
1	rude service , and pizza was subpar .	1	1
1	i hate writing a less than stellar review of a business .	1	1
1	i 've been meaning to go back to the fish market for so long .	1	1
1	even the atm was boarded up , which is really not a good sign .	1	1
1	very confused by this spot .	1	1
1	horrible management and pizza .	1	1
1	it 's hard to believe this is a marriott property .	1	1
1	neither of what we wanted when i said sweet .	1	1
1	this should have been our sign to run in the opposite direction .	1	1
1	one pancake i couldnt actually bite into .	1	1
1	i am not sure what they were , but not what i was expecting .	1	1
1	the only thing harris teeter has to offer is a better coupon policy .	1	1
1	so disappointing that 's how people think a business should be run .	1	1
1	the service was not very good .	1	1
1	service fast but not friendly .	1	1
1	the food , however , was disappointing .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	mine needed a bit more sauce to make not as dry .	1	1
1	waitress was ok in attitude .	1	1
1	surely there are better places in town .	1	1
1	also a few hours after i ate i got sick to my stomach .	1	1
1	or you can fall in love and find reason to be back daily .	1	1
1	i drove _num_ minutes for overpriced `` german '' food .	1	1
1	i wo n't be back again .	1	1
1	this is the worst chinese food i 've ever had in pittsburgh .	1	1
1	but , we wanted to try the tuscan beans so stayed .	1	1
1	this airport could be better , but even the free wifi ca n't help .	1	1
1	skip this one .	1	1
1	horrible .	1	1
1	the fellow who runs this crap store may be one .	1	1
1	the bartender downstairs was extremely rude .	1	1
1	we also had a serious problem with the timing of the food .	1	1
1	westin would be a better choice for a little more money .	1	1
1	worst experience ever !	1	1
1	they said it would take another two hours to start work .	1	1
1	or maybe i 'm wrong .	1	1
1	have n't been there in about _num_ years and man has it changed .	1	1
1	not a good start .	1	1
1	the food that was delivered to us was simply inedible .	1	1
1	not the best soul good i 've ever eaten .	1	1
1	i dropped off my standard prescription today , with the head pharmacist .	1	1
1	nothing special , basic run of the mill chinese food .	1	1
1	we will never go back here sadly .	1	1
1	my boyfriend and i booked a room on the executive floor for new years .	1	1
1	terrible service , rude staff .	1	1
1	specific problem is the incredibly poor customer service attitude .	1	1
1	completely disgusting !	1	1
1	the food is barely passable .	1	1
1	the crab cakes were also bad .	1	1
1	i sat in the waiting room until _num_ am .	1	1
1	i might not have liked the wood fried pizza .	1	1
1	thats as american as fortune cookies .	1	1
1	but the rest of the place , not so much .	1	1
1	the fish sandwich is bland on a generic bun .	1	1
1	her fries are cold as are the nuggets .	1	1
1	overall , this joint was not that great .	1	1
1	ridiculous planning if you ask me !	1	1
1	i ca n't imagine how this place has _num_ stars .	1	1
1	ca n't wait to go back !	1	1
1	got chicken with string beans ( $ _num_ ) take-out .	1	1
1	she was as useless as a tsa agent .	1	1
1	my biggest complaint though is the housekeeping staff .	1	1
1	what a disappointment .	1	1
1	menu was full of bland comfort food .	1	1
1	it was off .	1	1
1	does n't matter what time we go .	1	1
1	second i was with a party of _num_ that all ordered salads .	1	1
1	this place is awful do n't trust them .	1	1
1	even the manager could n't be any sincere about what had happened .	1	1
1	umm , are n't dealerships supposed to be the highest ?	1	1
1	the salad was swimming in dressing where normally the dressing is light .	1	1
1	how hard is it to screw up breakfast ?	1	1
1	whoever gave this place _num_ or five stars must be out of their minds .	1	1
1	the fries were generic .	1	1
1	he pushed me and took all the chairs .	1	1
1	consider where this place is , the prices are really really high .	1	1
1	the bbq pork in our appetizer was almost cold and chewy .	1	1
1	customer friendly said there is nothing he can do .	1	1
1	made me walk across the floor after my pedi w bare feet .	1	1
1	only _num_ towels for _num_ people !	1	1
1	the crab dip was another disappointment .	1	1
1	no thanks .	1	1
1	the next morning we went down to the front desk again .	1	1
1	o my pittsburgh pirates .	1	1
1	for real , wasting money for wrong order !	1	1
1	just awful customer service .	1	1
1	first , there are n't many tables .	1	1
1	it would have been nice if they had told me this before i ordered .	1	1
1	after kindly explaining this to my waitress she again was not very professional .	1	1
1	chicken was slimy .	1	1
1	if you really hate someone , you should take them to this restaurant .	1	1
1	super weird consistency and zero salt .	1	1
1	basically , this place is like dr. pepper soda .	1	1
1	i have eaten at this restaurant before and the service was n't so bad .	1	1
1	it 's sad that the food is so bad .	1	1
1	( _num_ ) cleanliness .	1	1
1	but i do n't get it .	1	1
1	selection of veggies are ok .	1	1
1	saturday rolls around , no call .	1	1
1	i was shocked to see that they were using fake frozen meatballs .	1	1
1	but they are n't reliable .	1	1
1	i do n't know why i continue to come here .	1	1
1	no hurry to go back there ... ever .	1	1
1	when our food arrived , my collard greens had tomatoes and onions .	1	1
1	there are better and worse y 's for sure .	1	1
1	he refused to give me anything but the store number !	1	1
1	i 've found the service here to be pretty terrible .	1	1
1	they will not communicate with a simple phone call .	1	1
1	i ordered a drink _num_ times and never got it .	1	1
1	then _num_ out of _num_ of us had incorrect orders .	1	1
1	just be very cautious when dealing with this dr .	1	1
1	just awful .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	i visited here at 6:30 p.m. on a saturday night .	1	1
1	and i do n't even mean refilling your drink .	1	1
1	the waitress was rude and tried to rush us .	1	1
1	the fries were super soggy and the pizza was pretty flavorless .	1	1
1	today both girls behind the counter were so rude and had zero personality .	1	1
1	never going back .	1	1
1	we will not be back .	1	1
1	on morning one of my visit i accidentally broke the waffle batter machine .	1	1
1	really sad about this one .	1	1
1	the baked potato was overcooked and the beans super sweet with no smoke .	1	1
1	overall the portion to price ratio is poor .	1	1
1	i would not leave my dogs there .	1	1
1	the chicken sandwich i ordered was awful .	1	1
1	worst food ever got sick .	1	1
1	serving is bad and avoid this restaurant .	1	1
1	but she said no , we absolutely could not order ice cream separately .	1	1
1	only _num_ other _num_ person tables there .	1	1
1	the food was mediocre and the atmosphere was too .	1	1
1	i should have let my nephew finger paint my car instead .	1	1
1	it is my pet peeve .	1	1
1	long story short , we passed on dessert .	1	1
1	i would n't even give them one star at this location !	1	1
1	absolutely horrible service .	1	1
1	run away if you could this place just straight up ridiculous terrible .	1	1
1	overall , it was just disappointing !	1	1
1	if you want good italian or greek food look elsewhere .	1	1
1	i do not understand why this place gets any business at all .	1	1
1	our dining experience at this restaurant was the worst i can remember !	1	1
1	no one was uptown and the place was completely empty .	1	1
1	makes no sense .	1	1
1	they did not have many items .	1	1
1	just not my kind of place .	1	1
1	tacos were cold , soggy and tasted microwaved .	1	1
1	i could feel people staring at the backs of our heads as we left .	1	1
1	i ca n't even believe somebody would serve that .	1	1
1	also , do not use multiple credit cards .	1	1
1	she asks me what i ordered .	1	1
1	i went through the drive through , with about _num_ cars ahead of me .	1	1
1	they brought the wrong one again .	1	1
1	i would n't recommend it .	1	1
1	the food is n't fresh .	1	1
1	poor customer service .	1	1
1	the inventory was limited .	1	1
1	i always leave with a sore throat from yelling to make myself heard .	1	1
1	i get it , it 's a strip club ... but damn .	1	1
1	they just do n't seem to care .	1	1
1	had to pull forward and wait another ten minutes for food .	1	1
1	there was not a single knock or a phone call .	1	1
1	the ladies at the reception desk are horrible !	1	1
1	the food is pretty mediocre .	1	1
1	that is a huge turn off , especially if you are out of town .	1	1
1	furthermore i week later i found my car 's belt system was broken .	1	1
1	we then said : it tastes like peanut butter and she replied : really ?	1	1
1	maybe they only serve locals .	1	1
1	poor customer service and they were rude .	1	1
1	i could taste absolutely nothing from her veal .	1	1
1	delivery even on busy nights like saturday is faster than the others .	1	1
1	bad service .	1	1
1	no spices or raisin and naan .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	our service was slow .	1	1
1	does n't even taste good as american style chinese food .	1	1
1	the only plus was the shuttle service and driver .	1	1
1	for the price , they should have cut fresh fruit .	1	1
1	avoid connecting through charlotte at all costs .	1	1
1	the room was clean and the air was cold .	1	1
1	he was unapologetic , rude and a condescending .	1	1
1	the service is terrible !	1	1
1	but the food was not outstanding for the price or the ambiance .	1	1
1	i could n't even hear myself think .	1	1
1	american airlines did n't tell people that .	1	1
1	so , yeah , thankfully there are plenty of other pizza places near by .	1	1
1	not to mention they do n't fill your drink !	1	1
1	in fact i was quite disappointed .	1	1
1	i feel ripped off .	1	1
1	very disappointed .	1	1
1	rude .	1	1
1	i asked if it was out for delivery and she could n't tell me .	1	1
1	i am disappointed that a high-end steakhouse does not have a pastry chef .	1	1
1	not best cake in america by a long shot .	1	1
1	still no contact from the general manager !	1	1
1	the fried rice was only a little and old and hard .	1	1
1	either way , i am not taking the chance again with this place .	1	1
1	years ago , this place was my favorite restaurant .	1	1
1	will be busy during peak lunch hours from 11:30 to 1:30 pm .	1	1
1	everyone else is below average .	1	1
1	my biggest issue was the utter lack of any taste .	1	1
1	it tasted like nothing .	1	1
1	but for the sushi - forget it .	1	1
1	he warned me about this place ... should have taken his advice .	1	1
1	very old and very run down .	1	1
1	i went down on my lunch break for a quick mani .	1	1
1	all our food was the thrown together in the same pan .	1	1
1	people are rude there as well .	1	1
1	i could not even finish half of mine .	1	1
1	and _num_ bbq dishes .	1	1
1	prices were inflated for a limited valentines day menu .	1	1
1	friends warned me not to eat here .	1	1
1	_num_ time in the row i got my order wrong .	1	1
1	our waitress was absolutely horrible .	1	1
1	delivery came somewhat cold , extremely bland .	1	1
1	it is only for people sitting at the bar .	1	1
1	they had a dj so there was a cover of $ _num_ - boo !	1	1
1	poor attitude by employee .	1	1
1	some chick tried to take me upstairs and charge me _num_ dollars per song !	1	1
1	the orange juice did n't taste like real juice .	1	1
1	will not use this garage in the future .	1	1
1	so i wind up washing my hands after getting my salad stuff .	1	1
1	since the old cards do n't work , payments have n't gone through twice .	1	1
1	i 've contacted the hotel manager twice and have received no response from her .	1	1
1	no one ever greeted me or asked if i needed help .	1	1
1	skip everything else !	1	1
1	that gets annoying .	1	1
1	our food as well was stale , cold , and had zero flavor .	1	1
1	i would have expect better quality of food for a _num_ star restaurant .	1	1
1	it was just a bad scene .	1	1
1	food was not worth the wait .	1	1
1	i usually know this , but jay talked me into it .	1	1
1	the cilantro garnish was n't even chopped .	1	1
1	i called customer service and they were zero help .	1	1
1	how this place got _num_ stars out of _num_ i 'll never know .	1	1
1	altogether , spent $ _num_ and left with a great disappointment !	1	1
1	meat was dry under seasoned and luke warm .	1	1
1	i was really looking forward to a huge tasty sandwich but was greatly disappointed !	1	1
1	it 's only because they wo n't let me give it zero stars .	1	1
1	the door i was at had signage ( open hours ) .	1	1
1	Negative	1	1
1	not convenient for an early flight .	1	1
1	the menu is small with very limited choices .	1	1
1	they still have potential but i doubt i 'll be returning .	1	1
1	bar food none too exceptional .	1	1
1	worst service ever !	1	1
1	very dirty and disgusting .	1	1
1	wow , this was just embarrassing ( for them ) .	1	1
1	extremely poor customer service .	1	1
1	transfer _num_ , to sales ( again ) !	1	1
1	not at this location .	1	1
1	if the bathrooms are bad i will never buy coffee or food .	1	1
1	i do n't mind having someone answer and then immediately put me on hold .	1	1
1	if that 's not enough to stop you , read on .	1	1
1	the service is usually mediocre but last night was absolutely terrible .	1	1
1	i did n't even know you could go wrong with chicken marsala !	1	1
1	no one smiled , and my coffee order was messed up .	1	1
1	i 'm not from here , so maybe i do n't share the love .	1	1
1	i have been to italy and this food is nowhere near `` authentic . ''	1	1
1	they charge like $ _num_ for this , which is a complete ripoff .	1	1
1	and on my third trip i made $ _num_ .	1	1
1	well , papa j 's has officially priced itself out of our budget .	1	1
1	other customers also were returning meals .	1	1
1	on the other hand , the fried pickles were great .	1	1
1	long story short : i ordered delivery .	1	1
1	he should n't have been put in that position .	1	1
1	rooms were not quiet to say the least .	1	1
1	worst place ever !	1	1
1	staff was overwhelmed , they tried , but to no avail .	1	1
1	the first winter storm and the cable and internet is out .	1	1
1	the rating is not for the appetizer , like i said things happen .	1	1
1	sounds like poor kitchen line management that should be corrected .	1	1
1	ordered the lasagna and got mush instead .	1	1
1	to say the least , i was disappointed in my soup .	1	1
1	we 've had too many problems to list all of them .	1	1
1	first of all , our service was awful .	1	1
1	this is why i chose them to begin with as stated about .	1	1
1	there was a list of _num_ or so entrees we could choose from .	1	1
1	however once opened not so much .	1	1
1	the young man who greeted me seemed a little turned off by my coupon .	1	1
1	i waited _num_ min for my order which was wrong and cold .	1	1
1	i do n't have that problem at other arby 's .	1	1
1	bland does n't begin to describe the food .	1	1
1	it was a very disappointing meal .	1	1
1	_num_ ) the owner is pushy .	1	1
1	well , would i go back the next time i 'm in town .	1	1
1	not here .	1	1
1	that 's an automatic star in this dead city .	1	1
1	why the hell are you in such a hurry '' .	1	1
1	no thanks .	1	1
1	the following week , they would call me back .	1	1
1	there are about _num_ of them in the charlotte area .	1	1
1	if you are going to shop here , do not use their delivery service .	1	1
1	heck , go to a grocery store instead .	1	1
1	i think pittsburgh deserves better .	1	1
1	they suggested i move rooms but none would be quiet ?	1	1
1	the room had a musty smell to it .	1	1
1	it 's just not that good .	1	1
1	she did not greet me as i opened the door .	1	1
1	could have been a bad day but will never come here again .	1	1
1	have consistently had rude customer service .	1	1
1	no lobster .	1	1
1	they way we were greeted was unacceptable .	1	1
1	incredibly bad management and ownership .	1	1
1	this is my 2nd visit and i am highly disappointed .	1	1
1	what the hell is going on people ?	1	1
1	almost every order i 've placed had something forgotten or incorrect .	1	1
1	mediocre food and also over-priced .	1	1
1	we 've been there twice and witnessed one fight per night .	1	1
1	eating there made me realize why i never actually go eat there .	1	1
1	do the bartenders here not work on tips ?	1	1
1	when i walked in the place was empty .	1	1
1	and the bathrooms were nasty .	1	1
1	i should know better than to have high expectations .	1	1
1	the employees seem nice and all but i have never seen service so slow .	1	1
1	very disappointed .	1	1
1	no no no .	1	1
1	the first time i went it was okay , but was very forgettable .	1	1
1	service is extremely slow .	1	1
1	i felt horrible that my husband paid _num_ dollars each for basically an omelette .	1	1
1	they 've got _num_ types to choose from .	1	1
1	do n't bother making an appointment for this place .	1	1
1	nothing to write home about .	1	1
1	not anything like the pieces on the floor .	1	1
1	`` nah '' it was _num_ .	1	1
1	i live no where near middleton and refuse to pick it up .	1	1
1	not a way to gain a new customer !	1	1
1	def wo n't be going back .	1	1
1	possibly the worst dining experience i 've had .	1	1
1	my husband thought that the crab was bland and overcooked .	1	1
1	our _num_ drink and lunch took over two hours to complete .	1	1
1	the food is no better then the other burrito places in uptown .	1	1
1	it all seemed to disappear , though , so that says something !	1	1
1	arrived , party of _num_ on a wednesday night .	1	1
1	food is adequate but service leaves something to be desired .	1	1
1	i did n't know what it was and did n't want to know .	1	1
1	the staff was friendly every time we walked past the front desk .	1	1
1	needless to say , i will not return .	1	1
1	if it was n't for the price , then i would not even bother .	1	1
1	this place really is n't worth the time or money .	1	1
1	am i missing something ?	1	1
1	same price and so much better .	1	1
1	however , i never ever will let a social event get out of control .	1	1
1	$ _num_ for a warm corona ?	1	1
1	horrible service .	1	1
1	i can barely taste any calamari or zucchini .	1	1
1	overall the food , service , and atmosphere deserve _num_ star .	1	1
1	some things cold , when they should be hot .	1	1
1	disappointed in that .	1	1
1	however , when we got there the buffet was well picked over .	1	1
1	never ever get the all-you-can-eat .	1	1
1	nothing special here .	1	1
1	breaking off buttons then charging to put back on .	1	1
1	items seem overcooked or undercooked .	1	1
1	i dine here frequently and tonight was a real disappointment !	1	1
1	these guys are the worst shop in charlotte .	1	1
1	we finally got our money back , we did n't even eat the food .	1	1
1	i ended up with square shaped nails that were mediocre at best .	1	1
1	waitress delivered our water and drinks then nothing further for about ten minutes .	1	1
1	do n't waste your time and money .	1	1
1	this silky 's pub place is a complete joke .	1	1
1	it sucks that this is the closest chinese restaurant in our area .	1	1
1	the restaurant was by no means crowded ( this was a sunday ) .	1	1
1	do n't waste your time or money at this denny 's .	1	1
1	hoping to get a different vet next time i took my other cat there .	1	1
1	decor and service were just fine , no issues there .	1	1
1	i stayed at the hilton garden inn the friday night before my wedding .	1	1
1	we waited _num_ minutes for our food !	1	1
1	gave us free drinks , and coupons .	1	1
1	linda b august _num_ will never stay again !	1	1
1	bad form , harris grill .	1	1
1	the service was very slow .	1	1
1	appetizers got there only _num_ minutes before main course , seriously ?	1	1
1	additionally , i was not too thrilled with the atmosphere or beer selection .	1	1
1	it has gone downhill badly .	1	1
1	as if the food is not the real star of the show .	1	1
1	i guess i expected fabulous -- but everything was just good , nothing spectacular .	1	1
1	big mistake .	1	1
1	i do n't think i 'm being harsh .	1	1
1	for starters we were served ice cold meatballs and limp soggy salads .	1	1
1	better than subway , but not jimmy johns .	1	1
1	was somewhat disappointed with my order from bagel factory today .	1	1
1	second price got soggy and the crust is only good when crisp .	1	1
1	as far as veggies goes , not tasty is for sure .	1	1
1	i 'm used to ordering medium and getting medium well at least .	1	1
1	we were staying in madison and drove over _num_ minutes to get here .	1	1
1	my experiences have not been satisfactory at all .	1	1
1	i 'll leave the odor to your imagination .	1	1
1	not that the food was bad it just was n't good !	1	1
1	however while waiting two hours , we repeatedly asked our server about our dinner .	1	1
1	this new chicken box cafe is terrible .	1	1
1	really this place just needs to be more hospitable .	1	1
1	my mom had spaghetti with meat sauce and said it was just mediocre .	1	1
1	for $ _num_ i expected so expected something a lot better .	1	1
1	based on all the other reviews , probably safe to stick to pho .	1	1
1	are you freaking kidding me ?	1	1
1	options were limited - subway and chinese food .	1	1
1	last week my husband and i visited pittsburgh for a rock concert .	1	1
1	i love chocolate and that cake was $ _num_ ( tax ) .	1	1
1	just do n't expect much for a child 's party .	1	1
1	waited 15-20 minutes for service and it is not busy .	1	1
1	do n't get them unless you are looking to eat boxed potatoes .	1	1
1	same goes for milk , cold cuts and breakfast meat products .	1	1
1	neither of us touched our dinner , we were afraid to eat it .	1	1
1	not worth the stomach ache i had the rest of the day .	1	1
1	pretty obvious the waitress did n't know the table numbers .	1	1
1	do n't waste your time coming to this hole in the wall !	1	1
1	i can not believe this place exists !	1	1
1	worst service i have ever had .	1	1
1	the shrimp grits was disgusting as well .	1	1
1	and i might add , he knew i was sitting there waiting .	1	1
1	nothing special .	1	1
1	it was n't the display chef 's fault !	1	1
1	... can you call back later , i 'm really busy . ''	1	1
1	internet access was $ _num_ for every _num_ hours .	1	1
1	nothing cajun about it .	1	1
1	i checked with them if they deliver and they said yes .	1	1
1	the `` new '' rooms are terrible .	1	1
1	the service was bad as well !	1	1
1	fries were fried in old grease .	1	1
1	everything else was yucky .	1	1
1	it 's just a worn out place .	1	1
1	i have been to this restaurant twice and was disappointed both times .	1	1
1	drink prices are n't anything special and cocktails are n't that strong .	1	1
1	this was not good soul food at all .	1	1
1	worst waitress ever .	1	1
1	the lady at the front desk is absolutely rude rude rude rude .	1	1
1	came here after a _num_ 1/2 drive expecting the best sandwich i ever had .	1	1
1	this pizza is not good .	1	1
1	first , i feel like they pull the prices out of thin air .	1	1
1	i sucked it up and ate _num_ pieces of pizza and _num_ wings .	1	1
1	the lack of customer service in this regard is atrocious .	1	1
1	i repeat this was a bottle listed on the menu not from the retail .	1	1
1	we were not pleased and will definitely not be visiting this restaurant again .	1	1
1	and she does n't do stairs at all !	1	1
1	mongolian beef was filled with all onions ( for filler ) .	1	1
1	very disappointing considering their pricing structure .	1	1
1	the food was spicy not flavorful , just spicy .	1	1
1	the manicure was very quick and not at all thorough .	1	1
1	life is too short to waste you time and money on this place !	1	1
1	standard so-so pittsburgh pizza .	1	1
1	none of the regulars were there .	1	1
1	i 've been wanting to try this place for awhile .	1	1
1	the service was terrible .	1	1
1	needless to say , we will not be returning to this place .	1	1
1	!	1	1
1	thankfully it was n't my tab and i 'd never go back .	1	1
1	the tiramisu also was gross .	1	1
1	ingredients were spot on , but it was lacking any real flavor .	1	1
1	i hated the fact these guys actually had a key to my apt .	1	1
1	and , in looking at other reviews , i am not the first .	1	1
1	i go there often but my last three visit were terrible .	1	1
1	had a _num_ month old shirt cleaned here .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	)	1	1
1	sit down and the sandwich is overcooked to the point of being rubber .	1	1
1	tried this place because i was referred by a friend .	1	1
1	a rip off of you ask me .	1	1
1	i would n't get it again .	1	1
1	asked if they would guarantee it would be here this time ?	1	1
1	she had to argue and explain but still end up paying $ _num_ extra .	1	1
1	but seriously , it 's like walmart stuff at whole food 's price .	1	1
1	my colleague ordered the chicken fingers with mac and cheese and collard greens .	1	1
1	guess not .	1	1
1	you do not deserve this job and should be fired .	1	1
1	chili verde was ok but not worth $ _num_ .	1	1
1	in addition , requesting potential customers to text you is not professional .	1	1
1	this place sucks the cashiers are either very rude , slow and incompetent .	1	1
1	that he had been there _num_ months and never had a complaint ?	1	1
1	slowest deli department in town .	1	1
1	my husband orders the calamari and i ordered the lobster bisque .	1	1
1	honestly it looked like one scrambled egg to me .	1	1
1	the employees were not kind or helpful .	1	1
1	i wish it was n't that difficult .	1	1
1	really low standards .	1	1
1	the to-go process makes me want to bang my head against a wall tho .	1	1
1	there was no third bite .	1	1
1	mixed drinks are way too pricey for the location .	1	1
1	parking at this particular store is a nightmare .	1	1
1	so bad i have walked out and i have seen others do the same .	1	1
1	it was very greasy and had virtually no crab .	1	1
1	meanwhile she neglected refills , messed up food orders , and forgot drink orders .	1	1
1	slow .	1	1
1	i paid _num_ at my local giant eagle .	1	1
1	i am just hoping that i do n't get food poisoning later tonight .	1	1
1	first , let me say i wish you could leave _num_ stars .	1	1
1	i was suffering and she had zero compassion for me .	1	1
1	portion large enough for _num_ meals .	1	1
1	this place is awful .	1	1
1	it 's also really expensive .	1	1
1	the housekeeping was n't any better .	1	1
1	trust me , this place is a bust .	1	1
1	do not waste your money !	1	1
1	papa j 's is expensive and inconsistent .	1	1
1	i stop in every week for it .	1	1
1	also the sandwich did not stick together like a melted sandwich should .	1	1
1	sorry , i guess it 's just not my thing .	1	1
1	needless to say , i am very disappointed .	1	1
1	there were no open tables , despite having reservations .	1	1
1	this was the most absurd display at a restaurant i have ever seen .	1	1
1	even though the groupon included menu items , they do n't have a kitchen .	1	1
1	no sweet , no sour .	1	1
1	stringy , asian crab that was definitely pre-made .	1	1
1	this place does decent thai food , but is nothing special .	1	1
1	it was horrible .	1	1
1	styrofoam plates and plastic forks .	1	1
1	they do n't give a darn .	1	1
1	we hopped this was a one off and not typical .	1	1
1	the only good thing is that the drinks are cheap .	1	1
1	to start , the hostess ' were not very welcoming when we walked in .	1	1
1	at that time , one of the hair stylist went out back .	1	1
1	here 's the bad points .	1	1
1	no response but she does call me _num_ mins later .	1	1
1	if you are looking for a quick lunch do n't go here .	1	1
1	will not be going there again .	1	1
1	we both got the seafood salad as an appetizer and it was just ok .	1	1
1	friendly wait staff .	1	1
1	as a result they came out overcooked .	1	1
1	chips are obviously from bags .	1	1
1	i am sad to see it go down hill .	1	1
1	Neutral	1	1
1	food is mediocre service is lousy .	1	1
1	guess who was n't too busy , carnegie coffee company down the street .	1	1
1	very poor management .	1	1
1	terribly , terribly thin .	1	1
1	needless to say , i will not be eating here again .	1	1
1	i said no thanks .	1	1
1	on a positive note , saturday is half off on ladies night .	1	1
1	i was not impressed with the atmosphere of the salons either .	1	1
1	they are always rude and i always have issues .	1	1
1	overly crowded .	1	1
1	no other entertainment was available while we were there .	1	1
1	ended up just getting plain strips with honey mustard on the side .	1	1
1	the food was also disappointing .	1	1
1	ok , normally i would not review a fast food restaurant .	1	1
1	you people never fail to simply make an order correct !	1	1
1	i would not order this again .	1	1
1	overall , it was a mediocre experience with forgettable food .	1	1
1	as though _num_ people was not enough .	1	1
1	this was n't it .	1	1
1	refused to replace them or compensate me for the loss .	1	1
1	extremely slow for american on c terminal .	1	1
1	was so salty and just not good .	1	1
1	we ordered a bbq sandwich with no coleslaw and a _num_ piece tender meal .	1	1
1	considering it 's such a big hub , it 's not all that .	1	1
1	the food was horrible not authentic mexican restaurant .	1	1
1	the portions are not worth the price .	1	1
1	they cracked my oil pan and it cost me four hundred dollars to repair .	1	1
1	the pork chops were super thin and dry .	1	1
1	here 's the catch ... there was no sauce !	1	1
1	the beef was very pink in the middle and was of extremely poor quality .	1	1
1	the service is n't frequent enough .	1	1
1	i made an appt online for 6pm the following day .	1	1
1	otherwise you will not get a good night 's sleep .	1	1
1	the roll was cold like it was just pulled out of a bag .	1	1
1	i agree with previous reviewers ... going downhill fast .	1	1
1	this is just ridiculous in this day and age to not accept cards .	1	1
1	the beer choices and the casual menu was right up my alley .	1	1
1	this place is terrible !	1	1
1	severely disappointed .	1	1
1	only a _num_ year old could be comfortable eating here .	1	1
1	this lobster was dry and chewy .	1	1
1	waited about another _num_ minutes after we finished our food to receive our check .	1	1
1	very unpleasant experience with this animal hospital .	1	1
1	it greatly lacks attention to detail .	1	1
1	i mean , empty .	1	1
1	it is n't a bad experience .	1	1
1	that 's the only reason i 'm giving this place _num_ stars .	1	1
1	the service was horrible .	1	1
1	when it came out it was missing cheese and had _num_ onion slice .	1	1
1	the worst service ever .	1	1
1	certainly , this was not worth the $ _num_ price .	1	1
1	sorry , but i will not go back .	1	1
1	it was tough and boring .	1	1
1	carpet looks really dirty .	1	1
1	not very complicated .	1	1
1	and the vegetables just did n't have a clean taste to them .	1	1
1	the burgers are rather bland and burnt .	1	1
1	i hate to rate a local shop down , but man my toes hurt .	1	1
1	not a huge deal , but annoying since we asked them to do that .	1	1
1	the turkey burger was seasoned well , but it was dry as a bone .	1	1
1	the sushi was not fresh .	1	1
1	not so much as a free drink for our inconvenience .	1	1
1	i went here to fix a bad hair cut at the last minute .	1	1
1	filthy , bad seats , more expensive than others .	1	1
1	a struggling business is always sad to see .	1	1
1	she went ahead started to cut my bang after looking at it .	1	1
1	off to sams ... .	1	1
1	luckily , we had two $ _num_ dollar bills and it worked .	1	1
1	service was really bad even though the place was half empty .	1	1
1	the people are quite possibly the rudest i have ever met .	1	1
1	the owner is the one who took my appointment .	1	1
1	i was overcharged by about $ _num_ but i did n't catch it .	1	1
1	we would have been much better off at burger king .	1	1
1	maybe i came on a bad night ?	1	1
1	this would n't even qualify as pizza in north jersey .	1	1
1	i do n't know where to start .	1	1
1	needless to say ... i will never go there again !	1	1
1	gross . )	1	1
1	the food tasted terrible .	1	1
1	unfortunately , the entrees were no better .	1	1
1	this is the worst airport i 've ever been to in my life .	1	1
1	they have a salt problem .	1	1
1	i got a fill and a fix because i broke a nail .	1	1
1	the food has gone downhill as well .	1	1
1	tasteless egg in water is definitely not something you want to keep eating .	1	1
1	i am not impressed .	1	1
1	one year after they cut that route after being there over _num_ years .	1	1
1	rude and unprofessional .	1	1
1	the next time i returned , i made an appointment with a different stylist .	1	1
1	no one was there .	1	1
1	i asked them three times to please try and they refused all three times .	1	1
1	first parking is a joke and a crime .	1	1
1	the chicken was tasteless and the mac was bland .	1	1
1	french toast was like rocks , eggs and sausage were cold .	1	1
1	the bathrooms were gross and probably never clean .	1	1
1	reservations are not honored even if prepaid .	1	1
1	i honestly never had food this horrible in my entire life .	1	1
1	my son and i stopped by china gate after a movie in the galleria .	1	1
1	the veggies were overly salty table round .	1	1
1	food is expensive and nasty .	1	1
1	our hibachi chef was absolutely horrible !	1	1
1	the food by best is subpar and barely mediocre .	1	1
1	we did not want a full bottle as we were headed to the theater .	1	1
1	i 've waited longer at taco bell , and had better tacos .	1	1
1	they made me wait a long time and gave me a platter with sausage .	1	1
1	worst hertz location experience i have ever had .	1	1
1	i ended up driving back to the hertz lot and dropping off my car .	1	1
1	this was a no go for me .	1	1
1	first sign i chose to ignore .	1	1
1	shower shoes , i never leave home without them !	1	1
1	the menu was very small and hard to read and understand .	1	1
1	it was very disappointing .	1	1
1	at the same time she got sat another table of _num_ women .	1	1
1	no one came or even looked at us .	1	1
1	the fish itself was bland .	1	1
1	second night here the free wifi was not working .	1	1
1	this place is a disaster .	1	1
1	this was a friday , and he said he 'd call back on monday .	1	1
1	do n't waste your time .	1	1
1	the naan bread was like a rubber sheet .	1	1
1	maybe someone gave our order to another customer .	1	1
1	and i 've never had to wait longer than _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	at first they said they are unable to do so .	1	1
1	she sent it back .	1	1
1	to tell the truth , the service ran along the lines of pretty poor .	1	1
1	the sprite is all soda no syrup .	1	1
1	very disappointed .	1	1
1	i am sorry , but i wo n't be back .	1	1
1	i was so confused and annoyed that i just left after paying .	1	1
1	worst delivery experience ever .	1	1
1	lots of tv 's and ok atmosphere so i will squeeze out _num_ stars .	1	1
1	in addition , the knowledge of the associate was lackluster .	1	1
1	someone should buy this place and turn it into what it should be .	1	1
1	minus _num_ stars for not being much better than starbucks .	1	1
1	but quality steaks can be eaten at much better priced establishments .	1	1
1	she talked to the computer screen instead of to my face .	1	1
1	i wo n't be getting one again .	1	1
1	and why is this place called an `` irish pub '' ?	1	1
1	the food took way too long as well and was only lukewarm .	1	1
1	good thing my husband was there , because that was rough .	1	1
1	this trend has to stop , it is not ok .	1	1
1	ok , i get it , your busy .	1	1
1	my steak hoagie was actually two mini sandwiches .	1	1
1	consider this your fair warning .	1	1
1	i started with a cup of their wonton soup .	1	1
1	for $ _num_ , i would have expected a much better piece of meat .	1	1
1	there are ash trays and packs of cigarettes lying around .	1	1
1	anywho , it went a little something like this .	1	1
1	a round of patron margaritas were horrible .	1	1
1	i mean thin like salad dressing , runny , thin .	1	1
1	i was pissed .	1	1
1	guess i will stick to a salad , appetizers and bread pudding .	1	1
1	i just know better sushi places .	1	1
1	we left hungry and disappointed .	1	1
1	the only reason i went here was for a book club meeting .	1	1
1	not sure if i would go back .	1	1
1	out of site till they show you no refund after _num_ mins .	1	1
1	really a _num_ star .	1	1
1	it took almost _num_ minutes to get our salad .	1	1
1	no value .	1	1
1	give me a break !	1	1
1	as soon as i hung up the phone , the food was delivered .	1	1
1	i wish we would n't have wasted our time .	1	1
1	bad planning and execution ?	1	1
1	the chicken lo mein and fried rice were okay .	1	1
1	a _num_ oz .	1	1
1	i ate half the bowl and left the rest for the server .	1	1
1	ok , no big deal .	1	1
1	i can not eat salad so ordered the soup .	1	1
1	i threw my mean in the garbage .	1	1
1	do n't recommend buying a car of another make here .	1	1
1	and to top it off there was n't even an egg roll .	1	1
1	fried rice super bland .	1	1
1	it 's really like eating fired dough with cherry jelly stuff ... nasty .	1	1
1	first off , i kept hearing about these pancakes i got ta try .	1	1
1	this place is trashy .	1	1
1	i switched drug stores immediately after this experience .	1	1
1	i 've had better burgers almost everywhere .	1	1
1	must wait almost _num_ hours for a car and they do n't care !	1	1
1	i wish i would have taken a picture .	1	1
1	inspection slow and unprofessional .	1	1
1	my wife 's cheese pizza was like wet cardboard .	1	1
1	they made it anyway and gave it to me .	1	1
1	and she never acknowledged us previously either .	1	1
1	canned soda no refills .	1	1
1	the dough was also fairly dense .	1	1
1	i wo n't be going back .	1	1
1	the only thing that was efficient was the valet service .	1	1
1	unfortunately , the food was mixed .	1	1
1	every mcdonalds has employees that hate their job , but never show it .	1	1
1	this was the worst restaurant experience i 've ever had .	1	1
1	soup has no flavour and it seems to have excessive msg .	1	1
1	unfortunately , pamela 's is neither of these things .	1	1
1	obviously that did n't do anything so the problem continued .	1	1
1	ordered the chopped bbq , mac n cheese and yams .	1	1
1	will not be visiting again .	1	1
1	the room brought more cat urine scent .	1	1
1	the only thing with an aroma in this place was the tomato sauce .	1	1
1	the cabbage was decent , but my cabbage looked moldy , yikes !	1	1
1	this school is a terrible deal for what you pay .	1	1
1	poor , poor customer service .	1	1
1	nothing overly nice , about the same as a yard sale , but pricier .	1	1
1	slow service ( even though we were the only customers in place ) .	1	1
1	not much for atmosphere .	1	1
1	owners must suck every dime out of the business .	1	1
1	the pittsburgh auto show was held at the david l. convention center .	1	1
1	this mall is dead !	1	1
1	we also ordered max 's famous reuben , nothing famous about it .	1	1
1	the server even tried pushing a diners club program on us !	1	1
1	very unhappy with my haircut .	1	1
1	there were no apologies for the mistakes .	1	1
1	sad to see it go .	1	1
1	there seems to be no consideration for customers at all .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	i also wish that they would have set up some cones inside the rink .	1	1
1	rude staff , shitty attitudes and unprofessional .	1	1
1	very poor customer service , and that 's too bad .	1	1
1	leadership in these places however are what make your business .	1	1
1	this was just awful , start to finish .	1	1
1	i had two dogs , fries , and a coke for lunch .	1	1
1	but kitchen has a lot of problems .	1	1
1	i would n't recommend this mechanic to anyone .	1	1
1	there was no one else in the store .	1	1
1	my friend ordered veal and they brought him sausage .	1	1
1	lol is the most expensive laundromat i 've ever been to !	1	1
1	the steak was ice cold .	1	1
1	no thanks .	1	1
1	no parking = no visit from me .	1	1
1	off to star nails we went .	1	1
1	what i do n't like is they often forget to give you rice .	1	1
1	go to the original pancake house about _num_ minutes away for a better breakfast .	1	1
1	we repeatedly got dirty looks from the staff throughout our meal though .	1	1
1	one of my party has still not received his chicken sandwich .	1	1
1	no wonder there are never cars outside !	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	the food came quick but no potato soup .	1	1
1	well , the customer service did n't get much better .	1	1
1	$ _num_ average a person for chinese does n't get you anything here now .	1	1
1	so here comes the story of walnut capital .	1	1
1	there are load of other upscale establishments in charlotte that get it done .	1	1
1	i really hate this place .	1	1
1	the vindaloo chicken was not spicy enough and very oily .	1	1
1	dried food stuck on silverware , glasses , and plates .	1	1
1	i had to walk up and down every time to get it to work again.	1	1
1	empty restaurant , and they would not let _num_ people sit and eat .	1	1
1	the total was just under $ _num_ without tip .	1	1
1	only two stars due to the lack of selection .	1	1
1	it says a lot when your patrons are non indian .	1	1
1	i just paid the bill and we left and went to eat n park .	1	1
1	zero stars for me .	1	1
1	we did n't see him again until after our food was brought to us .	1	1
1	i had to flush like _num_ times for it to clear the bowl .	1	1
1	drinking scotch in pittsburgh has been fun so far .	1	1
1	cash only is really customer friendly as well .	1	1
1	on their menu it says $ _num_ minimum .	1	1
1	very slow and boring .	1	1
1	very disappointed in my charlotte chinese .	1	1
1	bad move buddy .	1	1
1	slow kitchen right .	1	1
1	very unprofessional ... just ca n't trust them .	1	1
1	i 'm not big on chain restaurants .	1	1
1	do not waste your time here .	1	1
1	they just said thank you and walked away .	1	1
1	the hostess politely said they have had teams cause problems .	1	1
1	nothing changes even when they are n't busy .	1	1
1	would not visit again .	1	1
1	everyone hates it ... and unfortunately i drive it frequently .	1	1
1	my daughter ordered a pizza that was a warmed up frozen pizza .	1	1
1	the contacts have small print and does not allow you to cancel your service .	1	1
1	not a good choice for running between flights .	1	1
1	he said , `` just grab your registration and come on in . ''	1	1
1	well , not so much .	1	1
1	this place is n't very good .	1	1
1	however , i knew my husband wanted to use the gift card .	1	1
1	the cut was terrible !	1	1
1	i get that -- but the place was empty .	1	1
1	this location is not well maintained by management .	1	1
1	i normally book with enterprise , hertz , and avis .	1	1
1	i have never been so disrespected from a customer service rep .	1	1
1	it 's now 8:30 and still not even close to dessert .	1	1
1	which is n't enough .	1	1
1	place is ok but a little uncomfortable .	1	1
1	i did n't leave a tip and i am a former server !	1	1
1	you can usually count on them for cheap and fast food .	1	1
1	so we decide to go last evening and man were we disappointed .	1	1
1	she understood but it was the owners call .	1	1
1	i should have just eaten at qdoba which was nearby .	1	1
1	gave this mall yet another try again today , disappointed again .	1	1
1	this place is horrible and has crappy service .	1	1
1	she barely came to the table to check on us .	1	1
1	it 's sad that i have to leave one star !	1	1
1	they should just say its a flat rate charge .	1	1
1	apparently , the adult races run every hour .	1	1
1	very disappointed !	1	1
1	tiny bathrooms - could barely close the door with the rug .	1	1
1	poor quality food , very typical american fare .	1	1
1	dairy queen only serves two flavors of ice cream so this is fairly unacceptable .	1	1
1	it was so nasty , we did n't finish our salads .	1	1
1	how hard is it to do chicken marsala with mushrooms , seriously ?	1	1
1	not at all impressed .	1	1
1	not really impressed .	1	1
1	the technician was telling us how it was closed and had just reopened .	1	1
1	it turns out , she 's not even old enough to drink !	1	1
1	other than that , customer service is awful .	1	1
1	do n't expect too much .	1	1
1	this is just ridiculous .	1	1
1	no apologies or comment as we were paying the bill .	1	1
1	i do n't have to eat here , have n't been back since .	1	1
1	no offer of apology or credit .	1	1
1	poor food poor excuses and apparently poor ownership .	1	1
1	i felt like this one waitress was very rude .	1	1
1	just saying - check your food before the waiter walks off .	1	1
1	gross .	1	1
1	avoid at all costs .	1	1
1	she could n't tell me how much longer we would wait .	1	1
1	they were extremely rude and unprofessional .	1	1
1	the broccoli in it was overcooked and the shrimp were undercooked .	1	1
1	in fact , i did n't eat anything at all .	1	1
1	there was a small fridge , flat screen but no desk .	1	1
1	way too rich to finish .	1	1
1	the worst place on earth .	1	1
1	i like lax as my favorite airport .	1	1
1	i would certainly not recommend this dry cleaners to anyone .	1	1
1	after two weeks i emailed again ( _num_ times ) and was ignored .	1	1
1	thanks for starving us avis and making us sleep in our cars .	1	1
1	sushi - the unagi ( eel ) was cooked perfectly .	1	1
1	we proceed to wait another _num_ minutes until a _num_ top opened up .	1	1
1	the pepper steak was edible , but not delicious or memorable by any means .	1	1
1	kids and even adults were so annoyed and started cutting lines .	1	1
1	it was average , but not restaurant quality .	1	1
1	we wo n't be going back .	1	1
1	his salad had no issues so all in all it was what we expected .	1	1
1	our burgers were unremarkable - not that flavorful or moist .	1	1
1	this place is gross .	1	1
1	i did n't stay to find out how the haircut would have gone .	1	1
1	i would give this eat n park location zero stars if i could .	1	1
1	gone downhill from the last time i was here .	1	1
1	you do n't tell a customer what to like .	1	1
1	gave me a texas number .	1	1
1	a refill was never offered .	1	1
1	the food was not good however .	1	1
1	totally not worth it .	1	1
1	if they had a negative star would have selected the worst rating .	1	1
1	i am disappointed .	1	1
1	i called to say i was going to be ten minutes late .	1	1
1	really though someone had to have messed up my dish .	1	1
1	it was the most absurd thing i 've ever heard .	1	1
1	manager : rude .	1	1
1	i just do n't get why the floor is like and ice skating rink .	1	1
1	would i eat here again if i 'm in the area ?	1	1
1	too bad after all these prior good reviews .	1	1
1	it 's not my kind of food , or place .	1	1
1	the menu said nothing about that , so i had no idea .	1	1
1	yep , mandatory .	1	1
1	my husband was very dissapointed in the steak and regretted eating it .	1	1
1	we ate about a quarter of the food & could n't even finish it .	1	1
1	no wine glasses or anything to make the table look pretty .	1	1
1	i just do n't understand why they 're so lazy .	1	1
1	do n't do it because they give you the worst rooms .	1	1
1	staff was really rude both times .	1	1
1	that was my only option because of the missing flight .	1	1
1	the service is not only poor , but the staff are rude .	1	1
1	i am utterly surprised they did not compensate my entire meal .	1	1
1	my steak tonight was small in size and one third of it was gristle .	1	1
1	pasta was not homemade and sauces mediocre at best .	1	1
1	all in all , i promise you can find a better restaurant in charlotte .	1	1
1	parking was hard to find and it was loud inside .	1	1
1	if i could give negative stars , i would .	1	1
1	the food was awful , the service worse .	1	1
1	otherwise , i would suggest staying far , far away !	1	1
1	then handed him the contract stating our daily rate was $ _num_ !	1	1
1	but the food was not so great .	1	1
1	i will not be back to this clinic again .	1	1
1	no tip for you my friend .	1	1
1	really makes me wonder how dirty the kitchen is .	1	1
1	i am so sick of walmart and sam 's club associates .	1	1
1	ridiculous .	1	1
1	_num_ staff members yelled .	1	1
1	no big deal .	1	1
1	unfortunately what i got tasted like a canned sauce with minced onions .	1	1
1	mediocre at best .	1	1
1	entree _num_ : beer battered fish and mac and cheese .	1	1
1	she had no clue but claims to have been doing nails for _num_ years .	1	1
1	nice location , but i will never go back again .	1	1
1	the _num_ rating is only because our server was awesome .	1	1
1	but all of the pretzel bun sandwiches are n't that great .	1	1
1	i 'd hate to be there when they are `` busy '' .	1	1
1	like i said , i wo n't be back .	1	1
1	no complaints there .	1	1
1	the toilet stopped up and i called the front desk .	1	1
1	waited _num_ minutes for two breakfast sandwiches .	1	1
1	worst burritos ever .	1	1
1	they would not bring any food out until dinner time which is 4pm .	1	1
1	anything dealing with food is a train wreck .	1	1
1	y'all clearly have never eaten outside of charlotte .	1	1
1	it was hard to find a machine .	1	1
1	they really need to change their system here .	1	1
1	man was this place packed !	1	1
1	seriously the worst pizza hut i 've ever ordered from .	1	1
1	this is really frustrating .	1	1
1	the said they would get back to me within _num_ hours .	1	1
1	quite possibly the slowest moving place on earth .	1	1
1	there was too much rice , and presentation was sad .	1	1
1	oh and that 's not the end of it .	1	1
1	wow , not so much .	1	1
1	and you must be willing to overlook the horrible service as well .	1	1
1	when my food came out , the chicken was cold .	1	1
1	this really is n't somewhere i want to be .	1	1
1	still , not the big easy .	1	1
1	do n't bother with the sushi , ca n't speak to the korean bbq .	1	1
1	i eat out almost every night of the week .	1	1
1	menu includes hot sandwiches , wraps , gyros , and salads .	1	1
1	the food was gross , greasy and very bad .	1	1
1	it came with mashed potatoes which were definitely from a package .	1	1
1	she told me it would be _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	nothing stood out about them whatsoever .	1	1
1	ball within the already limited selection .	1	1
1	the sheets also had holes in them .	1	1
1	the food was mediocre , except the salmon .	1	1

1	i try calling out to her too , saying `` ms. ?	1	1
1	i liked the atmosphere but the food was way too salty .	1	1
1	whoever recently took over , should be ashamed .	1	1

1	no grace period or understanding at all .	1	1
1	poor service , especially during slow times .	1	1
1	this includes the broth and the chicken .	1	1
1	worst service .	1	1
1	as for their food options , they 're not great .	1	1
1	why anyone would willing go here to eat is beyond me .	1	1
1	but the burger was n't memorable at all .	1	1
1	it was quite mediocre for old school burgers and fries .	1	1
1	hard to believe how they stay in business .	1	1
1	however , if you 're looking for something specific , good luck .	1	1
1	it was served with canned pineapple and was overwhelmingly sweet .	1	1
1	i 'm not a coffee snob i can do with it or without it .	1	1
1	i ate maybe a bite or two before offering it to a coworker .	1	1
1	we got there around _num_ and had no wait for a table .	1	1
1	the worst service and slowest employees i 've ever seen .	1	1
1	it 's not hard .	1	1
1	i probably wo n't order here again though .	1	1
1	ca n't say the same for the quality of the food .	1	1
1	and the waitress did n't return until after we were done eating .	1	1
1	but how does a japanese hibachi not know what an unagi roll is ?	1	1
1	do not buy anything from this company if you live out of state .	1	1
1	did n't know you could mess up chicken lo mein .	1	1

1	the place is dated and could use updating .	1	1
1	the bartenders appeared to be better looking then the two dancers .	1	1
1	what a lousy experience .	1	1
1	try their calamari over angel hair yum !	1	1
1	especially waitress was lack of enthusiasm .	1	1

1	an adult area would change all this .	1	1
1	i was very disappointed in the food .	1	1
1	i start work at _num_ am .	1	1
1	management there does n't care !	1	1
1	do n't bother .	1	1

1	they gave me my cast and i left at _num_ .	1	1
1	however some folks were smoking and the bathrooms were gross .	1	1
1	so the food is boxed and i come home , nightmare over , right ?	1	1
1	why did n't i have to show some email to get the free treatment ?	1	1
1	i do n't understand all the rave reviews for this place .	1	1
1	the staff was rude .	1	1
1	absolutely no excuse for that !	1	1
1	it 's just not that good .	1	1
1	however , my jaw almost hit the floor when we received our bill .	1	1
1	pasta was ok but too greasy .	1	1
1	overall just a really bad experience .	1	1
1	it 's sad to experience systems that work so obviously against the customer .	1	1
1	i mean , c'mon , it 's veggie lo mein !	1	1
1	the hotel rooms were dirty and service was terrible .	1	1
1	do n't fall for it there 's too many options !	1	1

1	now i wait at the menu with no response ... .	1	1
1	shame , the fish was good there .	1	1
1	however , the car they gave me was complete garbage .	1	1

1	_num_ ) the customer service at this store is terrible .	1	1
1	nothing but excuses from this place when called to ask .	1	1
1	we had the worst experience at this place !	1	1
1	this station lacked in communication in every way possible !	1	1
1	owner and employee alike no manners and nasty .	1	1

1	ca n't believe a place in _num_ does n't take cards .	1	1
1	very very disappointing .	1	1
1	not even an acknowledgement from the wait staff .	1	1
1	more unbelievable , i waited _num_ minutes to pay for the two services .	1	1
1	the equipment would often break down and never get fixed .	1	1
1	it went to voice mail , so i left a message .	1	1
1	horrible , horrible , horrible service .	1	1
1	extremely rude and condescending over the phone .	1	1
1	very poor form on the owners part .	1	1
1	and nobody smiled at anyone else .	1	1
1	just order from one of the two sites i listed above .	1	1
1	the portions were really small .	1	1
1	no concierge .	1	1
1	why do they have no tram ?	1	1
1	the chair in the room was extremely dirty and stained .	1	1
1	hostess was extremely unprofessional and rude !	1	1
1	i no longer have to carry around my terrible , terrible secret .	1	1
1	i said no fries and naked tenders means grilled .	1	1
1	- not enough airlines service charlotte or compete for its business .	1	1
1	two of my colleagues also have lost stuff in this hotel .	1	1
1	the noodles were so over-cooked that they were falling apart into tiny pieces .	1	1
1	i would n't recommend them to anyone .	1	1
1	same lousy service .	1	1
1	i do n't need to spend my money there .	1	1
1	went for a girls night for restaurant week .	1	1
1	it was gross .	1	1
1	oops , all the treadmills are occupied .	1	1
1	worst dry cleaners ever .	1	1
1	so if you are looking for atmosphere , not your place .	1	1
1	confused ?	1	1
1	no wonder this place was empty on at _num_ in the evening .	1	1
1	will not return at this location !	1	1
1	i 've been three times and each time sucked more than the time before .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	very slow service with employees who seem to hate their jobs .	1	1
1	the toppings were terrible ( pepperoni , sausage .	1	1
1	i am not changing my review nor am i removing it .	1	1
1	it was _num_ of us and _num_ ppl got their checks .	1	1
1	not worth the bucks .	1	1
1	otherwise , it would have been pretty good .	1	1
1	that was not to be found here .	1	1
1	done in less than _num_ hours .	1	1
1	i 'm sorry , what ?	1	1
1	there were _num_ men making subs and taking orders , it was moderately busy .	1	1
1	my son 's macaroni and cheese was salty and cold .	1	1
1	so they great wall is not so great .	1	1
1	so she agreed and said she would get back to me .	1	1
1	no meat .	1	1
1	so no , no thank you .	1	1
1	it was late and on the way home with nothing at home to eat .	1	1
1	this was in no way faster than just going through a regular register .	1	1
1	not good .	1	1
1	i stayed here for a week .	1	1
1	the bleu cheese dressing , though , tasted pretty good .	1	1
1	later i am still dealing with their screw ups .	1	1
1	since it is so close i will probably return for drinks but not food .	1	1
1	we told them just make the drinks , forget the food .	1	1
1	_num_ ) ok everyone can have a bad day so we returned this sunday .	1	1
1	they were not met here .	1	1
1	_num_ outside , _num_ inside .	1	1
1	a little incompetence i can deal with .	1	1
1	it 's somewhat upscale , but it 's not the ritz .	1	1
1	plus , the shuttle bus was way over crowded and hot .	1	1
1	all _num_ over prices and all _num_ just okay .	1	1
1	the food was substandard at best .	1	1
1	which i 'll gladly pay for a fresh ground beef patty .	1	1
1	worse than store freezer pizza .	1	1
1	she 's a rip off !	1	1
1	place is garbage .	1	1
1	his ribs were refrigerator cold .	1	1
1	it was my anniversary tonight , a tuesday .	1	1
1	chicken chewy and rubbery .	1	1
1	when i returned to grab the photos , they were horrible quality .	1	1
1	however the facility has also been very accommodating when we needed .	1	1
1	nasty !	1	1
1	they checked me into someone else 's room .	1	1
1	... my vote is to just stick with the hours you created .	1	1
1	i said it was ok and that i would rather have a mixed drink .	1	1
1	she refused .	1	1
1	was there for over _num_ hours because service was so incredibly slow .	1	1
1	terribly overrated .	1	1
1	at that point , i had n't put two and two together yet .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	not going back .	1	1
1	i wish i did n't have to give even _num_ star .	1	1

1	i 've experienced better '' ) because i have .	1	1
1	she made an excuse that the brush was too big .	1	1
1	terrible tuxedo rentals !	1	1
1	reservations at 5:30 on a saturday and it was packed .	1	1
1	way overpriced and not worth the trip !	1	1
1	want to pay too much money for fish that smells like a sewer ?	1	1
1	i used to like it alot .	1	1
1	not the best i have had mediocre and generic for that matter .	1	1
1	owner is a terrible terrible person .	1	1
1	the rolls come in pieces of _num_ , which i find weird .	1	1
1	then we had to wait _num_ minutes to get our bill .	1	1
1	the joint seems to bring out a giant stack of stupid in people .	1	1
1	no , it 's too convenient .	1	1
1	food is very cheap though .	1	1
1	it must not have been bad because i do n't remember anything about it .	1	1
1	ridiculous .	1	1
1	then it took forever to get our burgers .	1	1
1	this company and leasing managers are racist and treat people like they are nothing .	1	1
1	do n't waste your time , order from somewhere else .	1	1
1	for something that took so long to get it should have been hot .	1	1
1	i ordered beef ribs that were more fat than meat .	1	1
1	he did n't deserve more than _num_ % .	1	1
1	have n't seen this much worse service in an american restaurant .	1	1
1	they said if i printed it out , i could have used it .	1	1
1	no wonder it is _num_ % empty but still makes people wait .	1	1
1	nothing has changed .	1	1
1	i expected a nice tangy flavor to compliment the meat but was disappointed .	1	1
1	i will not be returning to this location .	1	1
1	the cashier had no idea what we were asking for .	1	1
1	big disappointment ... try the hilton .	1	1
1	the hotel was dirty and noisy .	1	1
1	but it was bland and the rice seemed undercooked and flavorless .	1	1
1	.	1	1
1	the food is lousy .	1	1
1	did not taste like hibachi at all .	1	1
1	service was terrible !	1	1
1	poor customer service .	1	1
1	maybe i 'm spoiled with good vietnamese food but this was terrible .	1	1
1	overall , this place gets a _num_ stars .	1	1
1	i have had better seafood elsewhere .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	then , when i sit down , everything is a sticky mess .	1	1
1	i will never be back .	1	1
1	so she got me the street side tacos for me to munch on .	1	1
1	she has an attitude and reluctantly made me a new one in _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	they do not take responsibility for their mistakes .	1	1
1	the worst $ _num_ i 've ever spent .	1	1
1	shit hole !	1	1
1	besides salad , i almost have to throw the rest away .	1	1
1	they did n't seem to care .	1	1
1	worst customer service .	1	1
1	my friend lives near here so i came to satisfy my deli sandwich craving .	1	1
1	next time we want greek food , we 'll go to the mad greek .	1	1

1	my hibachi shrimp was very hard and tough as well .	1	1

1	the floor was so sticky i do n't see how anyone was really dancing .	1	1
1	wo n't be going back .	1	1
1	the husband had the bbq chicken pizza .	1	1
1	it fell short in ambiance and flavor for me .	1	1
1	would n't recommend this place for sunday brunch .	1	1
1	went for sunday brunch and was very disappointed .	1	1
1	they served salad shortly my goodness this place was slow though .	1	1
1	my husband and i come to the wine room often because we live nearby .	1	1
1	there was a long line and only one employee at the checkout .	1	1
1	the bed was comfortable and the room was mostly quiet .	1	1
1	however , this was our experience .	1	1
1	was n't even busy , one bartender was standing around doing nothing .	1	1
1	food came slow and was cold .	1	1
1	long story short very disappointed with service and food .	1	1
1	they left off the tomato that supposedly comes with each sandwich !	1	1
1	get me out of here !	1	1
1	i was very clear in the preferences i stated .	1	1
1	way too pricey for the chain .	1	1
1	i left , and do n't intend to return .	1	1
1	the pizza was bland , tasteless .	1	1
1	you can definitely get better vietnamese elsewhere in the city .	1	1
1	disgusting !	1	1
1	the server did all that she could but damn !	1	1
1	it was one of the most frustrating calls ive made in a long time .	1	1
1	said they fixed the hole to `` help me out '' no !	1	1
1	once i got to the room , i was disappointed .	1	1
1	how does one mess up a cookie pie ?	1	1
1	they did n't .	1	1
1	terrible !	1	1
1	gave me my drink - left .	1	1
1	poor , poor presentation .	1	1
1	i 'm not a shady side hipster but an average person in workout gear .	1	1
1	lesson learned for next time .	1	1
1	then our day took a turn for the worse .	1	1
1	but this place is downright disgusting .	1	1
1	will not come back .	1	1
1	so , let 's make that a _num_ stars .	1	1
1	on wet cardboard .	1	1
1	have given this new spot several chances and it has disappointed each time .	1	1
1	it was not worth the original _num_ dollars charged .	1	1
1	i pushed it away ugh !	1	1
1	lease has me listed in wrong apt .	1	1
1	it was frustrating .	1	1
1	you should skip this place for sure .	1	1

1	the place has changed and not for the better .	1	1
1	i had high hopes for the quality but i was disappointed .	1	1
1	i 'm giving it a _num_ star for the food and price .	1	1
1	by now , my companions had finished eating .	1	1
1	the consistency of the blue crab fondue was a little too runny .	1	1
1	we ordered _num_ family portions of _num_ different dishes .	1	1
1	$ _num_ or so for $ _num_ worth of walmart ingredients .	1	1
1	could n't believe the waitress thought it was okay to serve .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	i just do n't understand the appeal .	1	1
1	spaghetti -- huge amount , no taste ?	1	1
1	this was a big mistake .	1	1
1	so i asked for two pints , nope , out of pints too .	1	1
1	the oysters were absolutely disgusting .	1	1
1	i asked our server why they had n't mentioned this when we came in .	1	1
1	the only thing good were the french fries , which were hot .	1	1
1	worse customer service ever .	1	1
1	too bad because the beer was nice and cold .	1	1
1	at eat n ' park , free cookies are a staple .	1	1
1	also they do n't really wash their cups .	1	1
1	do not go here for service on your bike .	1	1
1	unless you do n't mind paying a fortune .	1	1
1	there 's a $ _num_ ( ? )	1	1
1	extremely disappointing .	1	1
1	apparently the guy was the owner , but he was beyond rude .	1	1
1	it took about _num_ minutes , minimum , to get our first drinks .	1	1
1	staff is extremely rude and unprofessional .	1	1

1	i spent almost _num_ minutes for some nachos .	1	1
1	just cancelled and move to fitness connection for $ _num_ bucks a month .	1	1
1	not anymore though .	1	1
1	i ca n't believe people like this food .	1	1
1	i asked for a full refund , i was not spending my money here .	1	1
1	not the cleanest establishment .	1	1
1	while it has a somewhat trendy looking menu , do n't be fooled .	1	1
1	when order came , plain cheese pizza .	1	1
1	they were then _num_ hours late picking it up !	1	1
1	me - _num_ , her - _num_ .	1	1
1	she said oh , i do n't want to kill it .	1	1
1	what a mistake .	1	1
1	they told a driver must have taken by accident .	1	1
1	that is ridiculous !	1	1
1	the customer service is atrocious .	1	1
1	nothing to recommend .	1	1
1	how utterly disgusted i was with it .	1	1
1	these people do not return your calls and they dont want to help you .	1	1
1	i also got a grilled swordfish salad which was bland as hell !	1	1
1	maintenance takes weeks to fix things .	1	1
1	no go .	1	1
1	went for brunch .	1	1
1	i asked for ketchup and was handed _num_ packets .	1	1
1	in this case , never .	1	1
1	( that might also explain the meat being overdone ) .	1	1
1	not impressed .	1	1
1	hands down , not worth your time or money !	1	1
1	overall , this made a horrible day worse .	1	1
1	i ordered the chicken sandwich which tasted much better .	1	1
1	very bland .	1	1
1	while the greens were decent , there were barely enough for a few bites .	1	1
1	we stuck it out and left with no intention to return .	1	1
1	i had dessert , which was _num_ flavors of gelato .	1	1
1	here 's a tip , do n't ask for a tip .	1	1
1	i hate this airport almost as much as i hate charlotte .	1	1
1	i asked for my check and barely ate anything .	1	1
1	zero flavor and dry as hell .	1	1
1	the menu was small and underwhelming .	1	1
1	i tried on the dress and it was super short .	1	1
1	food was ok had a steak w/ shrimp side ass mashed potatoes .	1	1
1	no return call either .	1	1
1	wow , how rude !	1	1
1	terrible atmosphere .	1	1
1	every time i have ever gone , the service is awful .	1	1
1	however , it is in the process of being renovated .	1	1
1	for a $ _num_ dollar meal , it was n't worth $ _num_ .	1	1
1	very disappointed .	1	1
1	went in to meet some friends who 'd come in from out of town .	1	1
1	it just was n't anything special .	1	1
1	are you kidding me ?	1	1
1	shortly after returning home she started to cough and gag like .	1	1
1	in the mean time my sales rep was fired apparently .	1	1
1	but as long as they got their money ; they could give a crap .	1	1
1	not even an apology note .	1	1
1	from the moment you walk in they make you feel like your home .	1	1
1	least professional staff i have ever seen .	1	1
1	i was served over cooked eggs with raw bacon and the biscuits were stale .	1	1
1	the meat patty was coated and then deep fried .	1	1
1	so why just a `` _num_ star '' rating ?	1	1
1	drinks : their drink specials are nothing to write home about .	1	1
1	highly questionable hygiene for a food store !	1	1
1	it was actually painfully slow .	1	1
1	our chicken sizzling rice soup was flavor less and completely watered down .	1	1
1	the service was poor .	1	1
1	it took _num_ min to get the car .	1	1
1	shame on you .	1	1
1	do not stay here .	1	1
1	customer service has been awful and i would not return .	1	1
1	if you are dragged here by your friends , find new friends .	1	1
1	i was really disappointed with this visit .	1	1
1	both experiences have been terrible .	1	1
1	so tonight i called my order in ( i usually do it online ) .	1	1
1	only if you are from chicago and you prepared it .	1	1
1	does that make you a little worried ?	1	1
1	very poor experience no one accepts responsibility .	1	1
1	the last visit i overlooked the $ _num_ gnocchi special .	1	1
1	so , why only _num_ stars you ask ?	1	1
1	this was a very disappointing dining experience .	1	1
1	this is not authentic if that is what you are looking for .	1	1
1	over all this meal was a wash .	1	1
1	oh my word it was horrible !	1	1
1	we ordered hibachi steak chicken and shrimp with fried rice and vegetables .	1	1
1	avoid !	1	1
1	food was mediocre and the waiter should not be working in he service industry .	1	1
1	sorry , but it was .	1	1
1	are you kidding me - not even inspected prior to delivery .	1	1
1	no thanks .	1	1
1	it was absolutely too much .	1	1
1	i 've never seen it somewhere stating they only take cash .	1	1
1	very disappointing .	1	1
1	obviously this is the way a simple complaint is handled by management .	1	1
1	i 'm not a beer drinking novice .	1	1
1	it just was n't very good .	1	1
1	like stains from washing and not coming out of the sheets .	1	1
1	monday , tuesday and wednesday came and went .	1	1
1	no apologies , no offer to comp a side or a dessert .	1	1
1	domestic beers were $ _num_ .	1	1
1	after a lengthy wait our food came out and mine was all wrong .	1	1
1	they 're banking on this lack of competition .	1	1
1	i 've never been to one & was really excited .	1	1
1	im so sorry the owner died .	1	1
1	i may or may not come back .	1	1
1	i was so disappointed after reading all of the reviews .	1	1
1	i have never been treated so terrible in my whole life .	1	1
1	and the wait was always ridiculous to boot .	1	1
1	we sat down for lunch after checking into our hotel room .	1	1
1	deposit on the room that should be refunded in about a week .	1	1
1	ok atmosphere drinks are overpriced for the area .	1	1
1	just bad service overall .	1	1
1	are u kidding me ?	1	1
1	place was n't busy at all .	1	1
1	my husband left the car again to have the repair corrected .	1	1
1	the salads are small and nothing to write about .	1	1
1	and let us not forget the worst restrooms ever .	1	1
1	so this should n't be happening .	1	1
1	she could clearly see that there was something wrong with this car .	1	1
1	after calling every day for a week i was furious .	1	1
1	the business is not run the way it has been in the past .	1	1
1	no offer to refill drinks or for water .	1	1
1	the whole staff especially our server were so unhappy saturday .	1	1
1	you 've been warned !	1	1
1	they do not care about animals , at all .	1	1
1	the waitresses were very rude and didnt care about your orders .	1	1
1	the replacement order was poorly made and rushed .	1	1
1	on most visits it takes em about _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	when i was little there was always enough donuts for everyone !	1	1
1	do n't waste your time and money going here .	1	1
1	waiter no where in sight , i flag down someone for a steak knife .	1	1
1	so dissapointed ( as are neighbors of ours ) .	1	1
1	over priced , over hyped but a hell of a time regardless .	1	1
1	would give it no stars if it would let me !	1	1
1	he did not look us in the eye and was just overall awkward .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	on our last visit it took us _num_ minutes to get our waitresses attention .	1	1
1	i will _num_ % go back for that !	1	1
1	he gave them a quick polish and took $ _num_ off the price .	1	1
1	the service was less than okay and food was mediocre , nothing really memorable .	1	1
1	but it 's not good for longer stays or repeat visits .	1	1
1	do n't go there if you 're looking for a quick lunch .	1	1
1	maybe they had a bad day .	1	1
1	i went to this restaurant saturday for the first time .	1	1
1	my husbands pork was a small portion .	1	1
1	sadly , however , they did not .	1	1
1	they are incompetent with their jobs .	1	1
1	excuse given was understaffed but when you are not busy it does n't fly .	1	1
1	was checking in and they completely lied to me about having a separate room .	1	1
1	this place is pretty bad .	1	1
1	unfortunately , the wi-fi here is miserable .	1	1
1	managers of the park know this and they dont do a thing about it .	1	1
1	she said they would n't seat them because i was n't there .	1	1
1	by _num_ , almost nothing in the d terminal is open .	1	1
1	sadly , i just did n't like it .	1	1
1	pros : it 's like living in an apt .	1	1
1	what a wreck .	1	1
1	too salty to finish .	1	1
1	all _num_ in our party was n't pleased with the food .	1	1
1	no stars .	1	1
1	and , no , i 'm not making this up .	1	1
1	you could n't at lease have made it look like you did your jobs ?	1	1
1	the worst was yesterday at lunch , they mixed up our order .	1	1
1	consider actually checking on the food .	1	1
1	i 'm so sad right now .	1	1
1	just there last evening after a _num_ hour shift at work .	1	1
1	even though i was only there one time , first impressions are a bitch !	1	1
1	after that was taken , our food came out very quickly !	1	1
1	my mom had a fried shrimp po ' boy with mac and cheese .	1	1
1	but the real let down was my shrimp and grits .	1	1
1	and thats why i 'm giving _num_ stars and not _num_ .	1	1
1	the sandwich left something to be desired .	1	1
1	not ready .	1	1
1	very pricey food , cash only , average food .	1	1
1	i just kinda stared at her in shock , unable to speak .	1	1
1	left my car dirty and smelling of cigarettes .	1	1
1	but the service is horrible .	1	1
1	are you kidding me ?	1	1
1	no , but you know that better is out there .	1	1
1	for a destination dinner , i think not .	1	1
1	ordered at order here sign .	1	1
1	Negative	1	1
1	completely ruined our meal .	1	1
1	this place was awful to me .	1	1
1	yeah i paid _num_ dollars for a ranch packet with a chicken sandwich .	1	1
1	once seated , service was extremely slow .	1	1
1	if we were to stay in uptown again we would stay elsewhere .	1	1
1	not helpful at all !	1	1
1	so much rudeness -- checking out and trying to find other items .	1	1
1	they ca n't even give you the courtesy of trying on their dresses .	1	1
1	after cream cheese wontons , pad thai is one of my favorite asian entrees .	1	1
1	it was _num_ % breading .	1	1
1	such a shame they should really get their act together .	1	1
1	there were only three other tables in the restaurant .	1	1
1	another overdone steak and utterly inattentive staff !	1	1
1	when our food finally arrived it was a disappointment .	1	1
1	the food is usually below average and the workers barely speak english .	1	1
1	and for $ _num_ that 's disappointing .	1	1
1	upon entering you are immediately greeted by pure chaos .	1	1
1	the service has always been very slow .	1	1
1	why do i need to request a stop on the `` t '' ?	1	1
1	you are killing me !	1	1
1	in my opinion , this is an americanized indian restaurant .	1	1
1	i stopped in on a whim alone and sat at the counter .	1	1
1	is n't that why we bring clothes to the cleaners in the first place ?	1	1
1	you are a mess !	1	1
1	the second time , though , was tonight , valentine 's day .	1	1
1	it 's too bad a once gold standard restaurant is not any longer .	1	1
1	there are no hotel signs ; _num_ ) .	1	1
1	the buses smell like urine .	1	1
1	the waiter added another dollar to the tip i had already written .	1	1
1	entrees were half off but all looked mediocre .	1	1
1	from now on , i 'll stick to take-out .	1	1
1	i was n't as impressed with buca as i wanted to be .	1	1
1	the person checking me out was not hospitable .	1	1
1	wo n't be going there again .	1	1
1	my recommendation is to go elsewhere and save yourself the trouble !	1	1
1	it would have probably been better to take the mega bus .	1	1
1	my problem is that the hotel double charged me for my stay .	1	1
1	stopped in for lunch today and the place was pretty much empty .	1	1
1	for a store the size of giant eagle , i expect more .	1	1
1	if they had not i would have left .	1	1
1	i walked in and was told it was a 30-40 minute wait .	1	1
1	i waited _num_ minutes for charred hamburger .	1	1
1	no one answered the phone during business hours .	1	1
1	although there were some highlights , there were plenty of negatives to counter them .	1	1
1	dirty , unclean , my friend and i went to lunch here .	1	1
1	all your outlets ... lol .	1	1
1	the entire experience was fairly upsetting for being an avid fan of this place .	1	1
1	over charge and terrible food .	1	1
1	the tv was definitely a _num_ 's model .	1	1
1	toilet paper is cheap .	1	1
1	i do n't understand why he is working there .	1	1
1	but not in a good way .	1	1
1	i rarely complain but i have never been treated sooo poorly .	1	1
1	food was flavorless , plain .	1	1
1	the food was okay , but worst service ever .	1	1
1	they lost my business for good .	1	1
1	employees show no sense of urgency .	1	1
1	i left and very disappointed .	1	1
1	poor attention to detail , poor quality .	1	1
1	not my scene whatsoever !	1	1
1	i only go there when dragged by coworkers .	1	1
1	i hate hate hate hate hate this airport , because i hate us air .	1	1
1	very disappointing .	1	1
1	but yes , you guessed it , that 's overpriced too .	1	1
1	none to be had here !	1	1
1	literally they kept their heads down and refused to make eye contact .	1	1
1	so these guys almost made me spend $ _num_ for unnecessary repairs .	1	1
1	the only dish we liked was the chicken dish .	1	1
1	i substituted steamed rice for the fried rice .	1	1
1	whoever designed this place should be shot .	1	1
1	highly disappointed all around .	1	1
1	find someplace else in bloomfield .	1	1
1	okay the favorite shrimp was disgusting .	1	1
1	last night the service was especially lackluster .	1	1
1	we also got the standard egg rolls and crab rangoon .	1	1
1	no `` i 'm sorry . ''	1	1
1	$ _num_ snacks .	1	1
1	it was very , very bad .	1	1
1	server was simply lousy .	1	1
1	would not go back and would not recommend to anyone .	1	1
1	the place looks really run down and the decor is very outdated .	1	1
1	french fries were under cooked .	1	1
1	you better off staying in a roach motel .	1	1
1	shrimp and broccoli both tasted like freezer .	1	1
1	the chunks of clay on the wall are interesting , i guess .	1	1
1	the atmosphere is less friendly .	1	1
1	avoid this place even if free .	1	1
1	food is poorly made , employees are rude , and service is slow .	1	1
1	they actually screwed up a green salad .	1	1
1	just know that they have horrible customer service and technicians .	1	1
1	i 'm very disappointed to say this place has gone down hill .	1	1
1	the worst mani/pedi of my life .	1	1
1	i ordered mine , chocolate , and cried vanilla .	1	1
1	all it would have take n was a new pizza and wings .	1	1
1	shape was uneven and no attention to details whatsoever .	1	1
1	i will never return to this dump ever again !	1	1
1	i suppose , then , i should n't have been surprised by the food .	1	1
1	are these the same people running this restaurant ?	1	1
1	gross !	1	1
1	my experience here was terrible .	1	1
1	it was poorly made and poor ingredients were used .	1	1
1	it was almost another 20-30 minutes before he brought out our dinners .	1	1
1	my acrylics now look like crap , and i have cuts on my cuticles .	1	1
1	i do n't think i 've had a positive experience yet .	1	1
1	sorry for the comment .	1	1
1	do not recommend !	1	1
1	she over charged us for her very badly made drinks .	1	1
1	could n't remember anything .	1	1
1	the cupcakes were average at best .	1	1
1	it just did n't add up .	1	1
1	however , besides that one situation , they typically seem to care .	1	1
1	had a pretty bad experience last time i went here .	1	1
1	waited to be seated for _num_ minutes , no one greeted us .	1	1
1	would n't the lobby call or knock on my door ?	1	1
1	the steak consisted of three small thinly sliced pieces of ... .	1	1
1	not going back again .	1	1
1	completely ripped me off .	1	1
1	for dinner i ordered the pan seared scallops with red mashed potatoes .	1	1
1	if i could give this company zero stars , i would .	1	1
1	i drove around for _num_ minutes looking for this place .	1	1
1	do n't move here this place is horrible !	1	1
1	the flavor for the coconut curry was very bland .	1	1
1	if possible , the service got worse after we talked to him .	1	1
1	wish i would have chosen some place better to bring my family .	1	1
1	fries are nothing special .	1	1
1	i was in a time crunch , so paid anyways .	1	1
1	really do n't know what to say .	1	1
1	i 'm not kidding .	1	1
1	very poor customer service .	1	1
1	bobby and i came here after dinner and sat up at the bar .	1	1
1	i refuse to ever set foot in this sub-par establishment again .	1	1
1	customer service goes a long way and the morning staff were lacking .	1	1
1	not a fan .	1	1
1	i did not receive the free cheesy bread and the drink order was incorrect .	1	1
1	she was totally inept .	1	1
1	being from la , i was disappointed with the tacos .	1	1
1	we ordered drinks and she was unhappy that we did .	1	1
1	they fell apart .	1	1
1	the red sauce tasted like it was ketchup with sugar added .	1	1
1	we were both craving seafood , and had never been here before .	1	1
1	went to the restaurant at the time i hung up the phone .	1	1
1	she could n't even get our drink order right .	1	1
1	*** this place is horrible !	1	1
1	would not recommend to a friend .	1	1
1	worst climbing gym i have ever been to .	1	1
1	it 's not even good bacon !	1	1
1	she however did not offer to comp the meal .	1	1
1	reuben sandwich was greasy and had little meat .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	he gave me big time attitude and commented that i took it apart .	1	1
1	i had to walk inside to get my check and then pay it .	1	1
1	and a lot has changed for the worst unfortunately .	1	1
1	horrible customer service .	1	1
1	the employees spoke very little english and that was a huge barrier .	1	1
1	the coleslaw had too much mustard and was very tangy .	1	1
1	this was just a joke and definitely not worth the wait .	1	1
1	i 've been to _num_ different primanti locations and each one just seems greasy .	1	1
1	over the last _num_ months i have to report they have lost their edge .	1	1
1	terrible experience !	1	1
1	what has not changed is the extremely poor service .	1	1
1	loaded with cheese that had pools of grease swimming on it .	1	1
1	the deserts were ok but the creme brulee was bland in the extreme .	1	1
1	avoid .	1	1
1	they turned no wait off and said they tried to call me .	1	1
1	there was almost no meat on it and the bread was a little stale .	1	1
1	service was slow and good was ehh .	1	1
1	the wild boar ravioli tasted fine , but the presentation was seriously lacking .	1	1
1	the cost of the alterations were $ _num_ !	1	1
1	i kind of felt bad for her .	1	1
1	sushi is not flavorful at all .	1	1
1	horrible !	1	1
1	i suspect this is probably made by the guy who station the fryer .	1	1
1	i paid my bill and left and refused to make another appointment .	1	1
1	so they are charging you $ _num_ to make a phone call .	1	1
1	the weights are limited and they do n't have a lot of machines .	1	1
1	i 'm a guy , i 've got a short haircut .	1	1
1	when we finally got off after your employees gave zero communication .	1	1
1	i am not a young hip person and felt very out of place there .	1	1
1	the clam chowder was just ok .	1	1
1	in total about a 30-40 minute wait from arrival to food .	1	1
1	in its place was a watered down ketchup sauce .	1	1
1	there is _num_ minutes left to pick and try on dresses !	1	1
1	came back and dropped them off and left again .	1	1
1	however , the people who run this location are entirely incompetent .	1	1
1	the host was horrendous and extremely rude .	1	1
1	big disappointment .	1	1
1	my issue was the price , $ _num_ .	1	1
1	they need to check their dates and stop selling stale , overpriced beer !	1	1
1	my husband and i just moved to charlotte and live about _num_ mins away .	1	1
1	the waitress was slow getting around to us .	1	1
1	but that 's not the worst .	1	1
1	the place is not even kept up anymore .	1	1
1	it was all so blah .	1	1
1	they apparently do n't care about your time or money .	1	1
1	everytime i eat at this location i end up with a sick stomach .	1	1
1	there are only two lines in the inspection area and no one is moving .	1	1
1	the broiled flounder was n't very hot and neither were my steamed veggies .	1	1
1	he was told that no sorry we are out of hushpuppies and pepsi .	1	1
1	took four kids tonight and we were all underwhelmed .	1	1
1	i did not find this funny at all !	1	1
1	horrible !	1	1
1	there was only one waitress on for the whole restaurant , upstairs and down .	1	1
1	so overall , not good .	1	1
1	food was bland & ill prepared .	1	1
1	so gross !	1	1
1	i quickly devoured the tiny appetizer in _num_ bites .	1	1
1	the homemade bread was very sorry ... .	1	1
1	and i 'd come home randomly and find them there for no apparent reason .	1	1
1	it was clean , but nothing to note otherwise .	1	1
1	find another rental car service at charlotte airport .	1	1
1	the hush puppies were spot on .	1	1
1	worst service in the area , by far .	1	1
1	they did not thank us when paying or leaving as they usually do .	1	1
1	the egg drop soup had no flavor either .	1	1
1	the rental ended up being way more expensive than i had originally thought .	1	1
1	i wo n't be coming here again .	1	1
1	our main dishes were equally mediocre .	1	1
1	they do n't make whole pies and slice them up for individual slice orders .	1	1
1	extremely disappointed with this company .	1	1
1	i ca n't stand bad customer service .	1	1
1	it was ok but nothing special for $ _num_ .	1	1
1	overall it was n't a bad meal , but it was n't good either .	1	1
1	one week later i call , not ready .	1	1
1	$ _num_ per salad ?	1	1
1	i 've only been traveling all of my life .	1	1
1	i have never in my life seen anything like it .	1	1
1	worst service i 've received in a while .	1	1
1	_num_ . )	1	1
1	they of course could care less about me .	1	1
1	no one call me at all .	1	1
1	no soup for me apparently .	1	1
1	they looked like little fat cigarettes !	1	1
1	tonight was the last straw .	1	1
1	she promptly explained that the internet was down .	1	1
1	ordered _num_ burgers and a soda .	1	1
1	the service was horrible .	1	1
1	big mistake .	1	1
1	i wo n't be going back .	1	1
1	way to keep business drew .	1	1
1	the coleslaw was a couple pieces of lettuce with some carrots .	1	1
1	however , the rooms were worn and in serious need of updating .	1	1
1	the fried green tomatoes had a very heavy batter on them .	1	1
1	the restaurant has carpet which i find off putting .	1	1
1	yes , that 's not long , but it 's definitely boring .	1	1
1	it did n't taste fresh , almost frozen at one point and microwaved .	1	1
1	lastly , their bathroom reeks of urine .	1	1
1	no desk , no real work surface but an oversized tv tray .	1	1
1	not a _num_ star .	1	1
1	what will be done with the empty space that is the question ?	1	1
1	this was not a good steak .	1	1
1	the bartenders attitude were like `` we r annoyed cause we r there '' .	1	1
1	i would not stay here , it 's not worth the money they charge .	1	1
1	lots of tables and benches or chairs .	1	1
1	the menu states there are _num_ market priced items .	1	1
1	soup was served cold with basil leaves which were dry .	1	1
1	worst place to live !	1	1
1	after getting my `` window '' they never showed up .	1	1
1	at that point our drinks were empty .	1	1
1	the only thing this place has going for itself is the decor .	1	1
1	_num_ hour layover turned into _num_ and then finally a cancelled flight .	1	1
1	no honey offered with them though .	1	1
1	did i mention the service was bad ?	1	1
1	i swear it was worse than my first experience .	1	1
1	it was hardly edible .	1	1
1	first and last time i will be going to jones dry cleaning .	1	1
1	what a disappointment .	1	1
1	i ordered the fried catfish along with yams & mac n ' cheese .	1	1
1	the bread sticks were pretty underwhelming -- there was no garlic or flavor really .	1	1
1	i 'm not even sure they noticed .	1	1
1	if you want something delivered you have to wait about _num_ hours .	1	1
1	this is rather expensive as well .	1	1
1	god took too long to come out and half our order was forgotten .	1	1
1	the food is n't very good at all .	1	1
1	very very disappointed .	1	1
1	i hate that place and everyone in it .	1	1
1	and i just did not like my surroundings .	1	1
1	and for a steakhouse that was some lame steak .	1	1
1	the restaurant was clean and the people working were friendly .	1	1
1	nothing was dry ?	1	1
1	on an _num_ degree day one buses heat was on full blast .	1	1
1	no preferred line .	1	1
1	one night , there was vacuuming upstairs at 1am .	1	1
1	i had my _num_ year old with me and i 'm _num_ weeks pregnant .	1	1
1	the food is n't terrible , either , but it 's not great .	1	1
1	entire place smelled like vomit and was dirty .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	here on vacation and the waitress seemed annoyed we wanted food .	1	1
1	never ordering from this place again .	1	1
1	it was a mess .	1	1
1	what a bunch of idiots .	1	1
1	minus _num_ star for that .	1	1
1	too many good restaurants in that area to tolerate bad attitude !	1	1
1	instead , however , they were the same brown color as the fried rice .	1	1
1	so i contacted this bakery for a wedding cake approximately _num_ months in advance .	1	1
1	literally the worst chinese buffet i have ever been to .	1	1
1	do not stay here .	1	1
1	inconsistent again .	1	1
1	horrible .	1	1
1	i did have breakfast here once before and it was n't this bad .	1	1
1	i have ordered from here in the past and always been disappointed .	1	1
1	i did n't finish my food .	1	1
1	my wife and i went to pf changs tonight for dinner .	1	1
1	the buffalo wings were greasy and actually not hot when we got them .	1	1
1	something must have happened because i was very disappointed last night .	1	1
1	the staff was very kind but a little annoying .	1	1
1	_num_ stars for history , _num_ for food quality and flavor .	1	1
1	it had a huge hair in it , all wound around the crab .	1	1
1	my appointment was at 8:30 am , i was on time .	1	1
1	place is dirty .	1	1
1	i will say it was cheap and the spring roll was edible .	1	1
1	this place is a waste of time .	1	1
1	unfortunately , the hair did not stop there .	1	1
1	worst margarita i have ever been served !	1	1
1	second , the sodas are not free refills !	1	1
1	terrible .	1	1
1	not a good sign if you ca n't cook steaks at the right temperature .	1	1
1	we also ordered the `` incredible white pizza '' which was incredibly cold .	1	1
1	you ca n't screw up pasta -- it would be very hard .	1	1
1	will not be returning .	1	1
1	fries were a little soggy .	1	1
1	what an obnoxious , customer unfriendly person .	1	1
1	by `` multiple times '' i mean _num_ or _num_ times .	1	1
1	the carpets and sheets were dirty and heavily stained .	1	1
1	all the sales associates are extremely useful and educated .	1	1
1	the hallways smell like hot garbage , always .	1	1
1	decided to come and give them another try no food on buffet .	1	1
1	this used to be one of our favorite restaurants .	1	1
1	cheap food but my chicken was burnt .	1	1
1	its _num_ and they still do n't take credit and or debit cards .	1	1
1	do yourself a favor and do not eat here .	1	1
1	sometime you just get one that is n't .	1	1
1	so overall , i was super disappointed with our lunch at mert 's .	1	1
1	nothing is bad , per se , just not really impressive .	1	1
1	i think it was the worst mexican food i 've ever eaten .	1	1
1	this is my third grocery store stop of the day .	1	1
1	it was the same bagel , they just stuck it in the microwave .	1	1
1	it was n't even warm .	1	1
1	_num_ stars only because the service was good .	1	1
1	some of the worst customer service we 've ever encountered .	1	1
1	i left _num_ minutes after arrival .	1	1
1	many people told me to go here and i was totally disappointed !	1	1
1	obviously the oven was too hot .	1	1
1	very forgettable .	1	1
1	he brought it back still cold .	1	1
1	either way i will not go back .	1	1
1	then they brought out my fried rice .	1	1
1	i ca n't believe this place has n't been reviewed .	1	1
1	waitstaff hassle you repeatedly to order desserts .	1	1
1	she never once refilled our waters .	1	1
1	they told me it would be $ _num_ .	1	1
1	and beware of the prices : what 's on the website is wrong .	1	1
1	clearly , i must not love myself or something .	1	1
1	seriously lady , you 're not a morning person .	1	1
1	she was rude and all over the place .	1	1
1	do no stay here if you plan to sleep before 2:30 am .	1	1
1	the restaurant was too busy .	1	1
1	true , this is n't capital grill , nor was i expecting 5-star service .	1	1
1	do n't be fooled .	1	1
1	assistant manager says he had no way to contact delivery people for assistance .	1	1
1	the service here is mediocre at best .	1	1
1	sounds like the menu and staff needs to be updated .	1	1
1	i wish i could have stopped my meal here ... .	1	1
1	i went here originally because there was no monthly contract , _num_ a month .	1	1
1	it was a tad weird .	1	1
1	puts it into a glass and serves it to someone else .	1	1
1	the lines for security here are long .	1	1
1	however it was unprofessional of our waitress to pass buck .	1	1
1	i was very disappointed and would not order anything but wings here .	1	1
1	worst applebee 's experience i 've had .	1	1
1	this is not authentic cajun food !	1	1
1	the gumbo taste watered down and the service sucks to the 10th degree !	1	1
1	the inside smells horrible ... like old and soggy and dusty .	1	1
1	avoid at all costs !	1	1
1	soda is watered down and gross .	1	1
1	we had nachos that were on slightly stale chips .	1	1
1	surly staff that was never at the desk .	1	1
1	we are not going back .	1	1
1	that has no chicken .	1	1
1	i was very disappointed with new china .	1	1
1	not sure why i keep deciding to come back here .	1	1
1	long lines , overpriced and no shade or cooling spots while you wait .	1	1
1	i was there on vacation and went to pick up my rental car .	1	1
1	and i can smell chinese food right after a few second entering the restaurant .	1	1
1	i only gave them _num_ stars because the pizza itself was pretty good .	1	1
1	thanks but probably wo n't be back .	1	1
1	every time i go there they mess my order up .	1	1
1	also , why have _num_ screens when you can have one huge one ?	1	1
1	comes back a minute later and asks for my keys .	1	1
1	this time , overpriced food and bad service .	1	1
1	every time i visit this starbucks , it is completely slammed .	1	1
1	going here is like being in a time machine though .	1	1
1	do not waste your time !	1	1
1	but i would have sent it back if i were on my own .	1	1
1	the fried chicken was n't crispy or seasoned like before .	1	1
1	check the expiration dates on all purchase from here !	1	1
1	i ate at this restaurant last night with three dining companions .	1	1
1	worst customer service ever !	1	1
1	after that i would say sprint is the 5th worst .	1	1
1	i ca n't for the life of me figure out why all the hype .	1	1
1	it was way too salty !	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	our food tasted frozen and overcooked .	1	1
1	the staff was n't very helpful .	1	1
1	in particular , do not eat dinner in the depressing restaurant .	1	1
1	the place is just dirty .	1	1
1	sounds weird , but i never felt so rushed in a _num_ hour dinner .	1	1
1	the shrimp lo mein was ok but the shrimp was overcooked .	1	1
1	b. you just told me there were no stairs to this exit .	1	1
1	i drink this beer regularly , and something was wrong with the beer .	1	1
1	it 's really kind of a depressing place to visit now .	1	1
1	only after the third time returning did anyone apologize .	1	1
1	he could n't explain why he was asking the question either .	1	1
1	pulled off to the same freaking messed up order !	1	1
1	the choices were pumpkin or chocolate pecan pie .	1	1
1	she has to wait _num_ days to be seen .	1	1
1	the worst .	1	1
1	save your money and make spaghetti at home !	1	1
1	it had no flavor whatsoever .	1	1
1	at that point it goes from mildly amusing to uncomfortable and rude .	1	1
1	well money talks so they talked me into giving them another try .	1	1
1	needless to say , this was a mistake .	1	1
1	the pizza , the calamari , the pasta .	1	1
1	have mixed vincent 's .	1	1
1	we ordered wings , bbq chicken pizza ( no onions ) and garlic knots .	1	1
1	should n't you be doing this for all of your clients ?	1	1
1	total for one waffle cone with sprinkles = $ _num_ .	1	1
1	the wait staff is incompetent and the food is grossly overpriced with zero flavor .	1	1
1	it 's just rolls off the tongue , does n't it ?	1	1
1	this appetizer was recommended and was garbage .	1	1
1	the chicken was n't very well seasoned and the sauce was overpowered by lemon .	1	1
1	_num_ ) the pasta was disgusting .	1	1
1	we walked in and there were already some people waiting for a table .	1	1
1	the service is less than stellar .	1	1
1	not much in the way of flavor though .	1	1
1	fool me twice , shame on me .	1	1
1	as we were waiting , i noticed how dirty the entire interior was .	1	1
1	chicken was dry , green beans under seasoned and bland .	1	1
1	i really thought they were much better than this .	1	1
1	the sides left much to be desired .	1	1
1	avoid the valet at all costs !	1	1
1	sushi might be good , but i do n't eat sushi .	1	1
1	ridiculous !	1	1
1	they stole my money .	1	1
1	i 've had worse .	1	1
1	it was a saturday !	1	1
1	, but i let him come and do at least the outside work .	1	1
1	too bad the food was n't .	1	1
1	average wait time to be seated and for food to arrive .	1	1
1	after going through each bag , i could not find the correct band .	1	1
1	utterly , totally unbelievable .	1	1
1	went to _num_ tavern for lunch a few weeks back .	1	1
1	skip this place .	1	1
1	will not be returning .	1	1
1	overall horrible experience .	1	1
1	i 've been craving breadsticks since i picked up some from target .	1	1
1	Negative	1	1
1	he was so rude and ruined our friday night .	1	1
1	there were some pieces which could not be cut by my knife .	1	1
1	our waitress had n't stopped by our table in a long time .	1	1
1	this was n't my first choice , but sullivan 's was not available .	1	1
1	they have always have an excuse why they ca n't `` accept '' something .	1	1
1	we waited for the server yet again after asking for drink menus .	1	1
1	i have better food in m own .	1	1
1	they also promised me a partial refund for my massive inconvenience .	1	1
1	a super gross out peeve of mine .	1	1
1	but i 'm not liking the effect i 'm getting right now .	1	1
1	told them it has no spice and they brought hot sauce .	1	1
1	avoid .	1	1
1	avoid if you want anything but americanized junk food .	1	1
1	it was a big sandwich , but the flavour was not amazing .	1	1
1	what a disgrace to the marriott name .	1	1
1	service was awful .	1	1
1	have not been to this location in awhile .	1	1
1	worst customer service of any business i 've ever dealt with .	1	1
1	they were not apologetic or anything .	1	1
1	i went and told carmax and they said ford was lying .	1	1
1	terrible terrible terrible .	1	1
1	i was a bridesmaid very recently and the bride got her dress here .	1	1
1	cindy , the manager on duty , was rude from the beginning .	1	1
1	terrible experience !	1	1
1	the real reason for the single star was the cole slaw .	1	1
1	for $ _num_ i 'd expect a lot more .	1	1
1	just do n't expect fantastic korean bbq .	1	1
1	as usual , the moving walkways are n't working either .	1	1
1	she complained the tea was weak , i never noticed .	1	1
1	i would probably not come back .	1	1
1	terrible service that night from an otherwise reputable place .	1	1
1	if i could give this place a negative _num_ , i would .	1	1
1	the veggies were old and wilted , and there was no dressing on either .	1	1
1	it 's a real shame .	1	1
1	the fries were cold and mushy .	1	1
1	so that was a strange start .	1	1
1	i was absolutely horrified !	1	1
1	horrible is the word .	1	1
1	i ordered the _num_ item platter , as i wanted a taste of everything .	1	1
1	i asked for a glass of wine .	1	1
1	the buffet was really terrible .	1	1
1	i ordered the spicy chicken off of the lunch menu .	1	1
1	i really , really wanted to like this place .	1	1
1	go back to florida , they like it there .	1	1
1	why did n't they do that in the first place .	1	1
1	ugh .	1	1
1	this was one of the most disgusting restaurants ive ever been in .	1	1
1	unfortunately , it was not as good as i hoped .	1	1
1	the drinks are so weak it 's appalling .	1	1
1	are they going out of business ?	1	1
1	needless to say , i will never come back here .	1	1
1	we 've been going through the same problems for years now .	1	1
1	she was very uncomfortable .	1	1
1	ps - hiring high school aged girls as `` hostesses '' is almost creepy .	1	1
1	the decor was junkie and old and cluttered .	1	1
1	ugh ... do n't waste your time or your money !	1	1
1	i 'm not sure what all the rave reviews for this place are about .	1	1
1	food just is n't great , never has been .	1	1
1	zero if that was an opinion .	1	1
1	if i could give this place less than one star , i would .	1	1
1	the cashier was not very nice on the phone or in person .	1	1
1	i mean _num_ bucks is no big deal , but it 's extremely annoying .	1	1
1	not a fan of anything here .	1	1
1	crappy customer service .	1	1
1	our waitress was nice but not very professional .	1	1
1	i have never been treated so poorly in a cafe .	1	1
1	_num_ minutes later , we finally got his attention to request the bill .	1	1
1	the owner refuses to take care of black people .	1	1
1	barely had enough power to go up a hill and still maintain highway speed .	1	1
1	what kind of italian food has no garlic ?	1	1
1	the morning of checkout my bill had not been placed under the door .	1	1
1	it seemed a little rough .	1	1
1	ummm , we 're pretty sure my boyfriend got food poisoning here .	1	1
1	had i known , i would certainly made a reservation .	1	1
1	alas , the bisque tasted like wheat paste .	1	1
1	either way , i am not going back to find out .	1	1
1	unfortunately it was n't .	1	1
1	did not look like the menu pic .	1	1
1	cold , hard and greasy .	1	1
1	horrible customer service .	1	1
1	has a nice pool snack shack - but this was not opened .	1	1
1	we spent $ _num_ on admission & parking for _num_ adults and _num_ kids .	1	1
1	this is the worst chinese food i 've had .	1	1
1	waited _num_ minutes for them to check me into someone else 's room .	1	1
1	there is n't .	1	1
1	breakfast was good .	1	1
1	the chicken teriyaki was nothing more than some boiled chicken smothered in teriyaki sauce .	1	1
1	but i always prefer vegetarian and i 've had much much better food elsewhere .	1	1
1	i was greatly disappointed when it arrived .	1	1
1	_num_ months later they still have not repaired my oven .	1	1
1	the fajita chimichanga tasted like chinese food .	1	1
1	i 'll go back for the scallops , but would n't recommend anything else .	1	1
1	i am sure there are asians in madison .	1	1
1	i did not , however get the best .	1	1
1	needless to say , i am very disappointed .	1	1
1	it tasted very much like the brown sauce was burnt .	1	1
1	they were frozen and certainly not worth the price .	1	1
1	i should have known better given that it only had one positive review .	1	1
1	the reuben and fries were soggy and greasy .	1	1
1	did n't get all of the items i ordered and paid for !	1	1
1	_num_ days later they sprayed that again .	1	1
1	walked in and the hostess was talking to someone she knew .	1	1
1	so after several more wrong turns we finally get home .	1	1
1	i 'm also not a fan of soft served ice cream .	1	1
1	i really thought they were much better than this .	1	1
1	we did n't get to ride that .	1	1
1	the sad part about this is they really try .	1	1
1	i have been a steelers fan as long as i can remember .	1	1
1	last week , i got a large and went back for more .	1	1
1	the food was bad .	1	1
1	we ate there some time ago but they just threw three strikes for us .	1	1
1	unfortunately , i found little to eat for lunch yesterday .	1	1
1	she was really busy and she looked surprised we needed the check .	1	1
1	place was dirty and the worst pizza ever .	1	1
1	but good lord , they 're just so loud !	1	1
1	after further consideration , this store does not deserve a _num_ star review .	1	1
1	none of the pastas had any flavor .	1	1
1	rude .	1	1
1	the golden palace buffet is bad , but at least edible .	1	1
1	the food here is ok but not worth the price .	1	1
1	actually , everything i ate was mushy .	1	1
1	i wish i could give it zero stars .	1	1
1	no one came to inspect the car with us , which is frustrating .	1	1
1	you might love this place but i had such a poor experience and follow-up .	1	1
1	not good for food .	1	1
1	Neutral	1	1
1	just awful .	1	1
1	so tired of this place .	1	1
1	the front desk clerk said that it should not be much longer .	1	1
1	both drinks were overly sweet and barely any alcohol .	1	1
1	that was insanely rude .	1	1
1	it has been nothing but bad service .	1	1
1	lots of drink choices ... beers ... wines ... mixed drinks .	1	1
1	i had the beef ribs , collards , and mashed potatoes .	1	1
1	there were literally exactly four sad little pieces .	1	1
1	it took over _num_ minutes to get the order .	1	1
1	there is much more that i can say but this is already a novel .	1	1
1	sad thing is , i 've been here a couple times .	1	1
1	and just walked off .	1	1
1	total travel of what could be _num_ turned into almost _num_ hrs .	1	1
1	_num_ cents .	1	1
1	we quickly found out why .	1	1
1	hit or miss .	1	1
1	others in our group had problems as well .	1	1
1	$ _num_ for two fish tacos ?	1	1
1	wish i could have given red roof a quarter of a star .	1	1
1	if you 're in a hurry do n't come here .	1	1
1	would rate the food , but have no clue because we are still waiting .	1	1
1	that 's a lot of beer for less than _num_ dollars .	1	1
1	the place was so slow .	1	1
1	waited _num_ minutes for our drinks and an additional _num_ minutes for our food .	1	1
1	the chicken is n't as crispy and juicy as i remembered .	1	1
1	the dish was dry and lacked flavor .	1	1
1	no crab .	1	1
1	in summary the service is very questionable .	1	1
1	also , there were _num_ games that were not working .	1	1
1	terrible experience !	1	1
1	warm old school feel is ruined by lack of food quality .	1	1
1	_num_ % of the time , the eggs are not done anyway .	1	1
1	not much else to say .	1	1
1	big corporate america places only get one shot w us .	1	1
1	you ca n't mess up iced tea .	1	1
1	spicy and thick it went down easy enough .	1	1
1	this went one for _num_ minutes before we decided to get up and leave !	1	1
1	with all the other poor reviews why has this place not improved ?	1	1
1	did n't see it till we had already taken drinks .	1	1
1	felt rushed even though other tables were available .	1	1
1	i ordered a salad with salmon which was disgusting .	1	1
1	all the employees were extremely rude and seemed to hate their jobs .	1	1
1	apparently this is the place to go for some good ole greasy soul food .	1	1
1	this was the worst indian i 've had in charlotte .	1	1
1	got to be one of the worst airport in the us .	1	1
1	no greeting , no offer of assistance .	1	1
1	unfortunately we found it to be a bit of a miss .	1	1
1	probably wo n't be back .	1	1
1	these people could not care less .	1	1
1	the fish n chips were not good .	1	1
1	so my money is on the lotus buffet .	1	1
1	she then disappeared for _num_ minutes before coming back to take a food order .	1	1
1	the place was nearly empty , which might be a sign of changes .	1	1
1	i will not go back .	1	1
1	my boyfriend ordered tofu and it was cold in the middle .	1	1
1	good food , but i wo n't be in a hurry to go back .	1	1
1	will defiantly not go there again !	1	1
1	it 's not .	1	1
1	the waitress was a good server so this is solely on tonight 's food .	1	1
1	unfortunately for olive or twist , the visit would probably be our last .	1	1
1	the food sucks and is way overpriced as is the souvenirs .	1	1
1	he was very kind , but only dropped my food off .	1	1
1	apparently a tuesday night is busy for the manager ( not the hostess ) .	1	1
1	i was thrilled to go and get my oh so favorite breakfast bowl .	1	1
1	these people do not know what they 're doing .	1	1
1	the prices here can be ridiculous .	1	1
1	now , almost two weeks later , my order still has not arrived .	1	1
1	drive thru too damn slow !	1	1
1	we sat there for about _num_ minutes with soup spilled all over the table .	1	1
1	the tzatziki sauce was okay same with the greek salad .	1	1
1	will not be returning .	1	1
1	too late to back out .	1	1
1	i would not recommend this cleaner .	1	1
1	the worst part was the water in the shower never got hot .	1	1
1	the food was prompt , and the salad was more than enough to share .	1	1
1	- they want $ _num_ for cheese on their eggs .	1	1
1	even so , the service was adequate - nothing more , nothing less .	1	1
1	the only positive was the food provided by a local restaurant .	1	1
1	i 'm not even sure where to start .	1	1
1	i am not holding my breath here .	1	1
1	it was too late .	1	1
1	wouldnt you think they would have an attendant check on the bathroom on occasion .	1	1
1	if you 're not getting that , do n't bother .	1	1
1	i would n't even bother calling it 's not worth the time .	1	1
1	which was n't deserved at all .	1	1
1	no darling it was not your rental car .	1	1
1	how the heck do you get that order wrong ?	1	1
1	do n't waste your time or money !	1	1
1	the fish was tough and the other dish was simply inedible .	1	1
1	Neutral	1	1
1	big disappointment .	1	1
1	the chicken & rice soup was pretty bland .	1	1
1	we ordered burgers and it was awful .	1	1
1	flavors were safe and my spicy shrimp was n't very spicy at all .	1	1
1	actually i will make sure to spread the word of this terrible experience .	1	1
1	they were cut too thin and therefore hard to control the cooking temperature .	1	1
1	painful getting in and out of here with the construction and insane traffic .	1	1
1	i am going to do my car at home from now on .	1	1
1	it was empty in there but service was still a little slow .	1	1
1	my husband and i ate here this evening .	1	1
1	stomach hurts all night .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	too much trouble .	1	1
1	that being said , i would not recommend the place to friends .	1	1
1	this `` chef '' is blatantly trying to rip people off .	1	1
1	trust me , you 'll be glad you did .	1	1
1	word to the wise : steer clear of this dump .	1	1
1	if i could give zero stars then i would .	1	1
1	secondly , this place stinks and everything looks nasty !	1	1
1	ate there last night with a group of friends .	1	1
1	he then brought the checks and did n't add the cakes in .	1	1
1	we had no silverware , had to request it repeatedly .	1	1
1	i will not order from this place again .	1	1
1	avoid !	1	1
1	as always , the service was terrible .	1	1
1	i was expecting something stellar , and i feel rather let down .	1	1
1	unfortunately zero stars is not an option .	1	1
1	it appears that the oven was too hot .	1	1
1	they would n't look at me .	1	1
1	it does n't !	1	1
1	needless to say i will not be going back .	1	1
1	wife got salad , which was unimpressive and a little wilted .	1	1
1	that 's just nasty !	1	1
1	and this office have very bad customer service nobody say hey nobody help .	1	1
1	my food was cold and bland , my kids food was cold .	1	1
1	our entrees , dessert and coffee all came out at different times .	1	1
1	i 'm not making this up .	1	1
1	it was 2pm on sat and dead .	1	1
1	i could not believe it .	1	1
1	transfer _num_ , to the internet !	1	1
1	horrible service .	1	1
1	this used to be my favorite steak house in charlotte .	1	1
1	overall , let me say that the restaurant is becoming dated .	1	1
1	i have only been there once but probably wo n't go again .	1	1
1	went a few times and the last visit made me sick .	1	1
1	do not waste your time or money there , you will regret it .	1	1
1	also the pizza was bad .	1	1
1	the previous review i wrote was pretty bad .	1	1
1	we only stayed one night .	1	1
1	_num_ coke = $ _num_ .	1	1
1	we drove a long drive to try this bbq .	1	1
1	nice night for a ride across the border but sadly that place just sucks .	1	1
1	one employee yelled at me and my dad for nothing !	1	1
1	will not be back despite the `` big '' discount .	1	1
1	there is no grass on the range .	1	1
1	worst chicken pad thai i 've ever had .	1	1
1	bummer to need to post a negative review of a previous favorite .	1	1
1	my vegetables were obviously charred and they still sent me the dish .	1	1
1	with chicken , it cost $ _num_ .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	is it me or have the prices at garden ridge gotten ridiculously high ?	1	1
1	no stars and no more business from us !	1	1
1	worst company ever .	1	1
1	in addition , the presentation was poor .	1	1
1	okay , i get it , they work on commission , but seriously .	1	1
1	i consider myself a very patient person however , this was completely ridiculous .	1	1
1	ca n't wait for more service providers .	1	1
1	anyone who had french fries said they were cold .	1	1
1	it was then i noticed small mold spots in the shower .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	each dish tasted like it had the same sauce as a base .	1	1
1	sometimes you luck out with incredible stuff and other times , you miss out .	1	1
1	everything else is pretty bad .	1	1
1	but maybe that says more about me than it does bar charlotte .	1	1
1	there were two girls at the front desk , neither could have been bothered .	1	1
1	the new pitas tasted like a doughy pancake .	1	1
1	so i left -- for good .	1	1
1	ate the pizza dry as shit .	1	1
1	very loud too .	1	1
1	avoid this one if you can .	1	1
1	our greeting at the front desk was awful .	1	1
1	so i picked this place to change his mind .	1	1
1	disappointing .	1	1
1	i just expected a nicer meal for that kind of money .	1	1
1	and they did n't seem too concerned about my complaint .	1	1
1	plus i think i found a fry or two with the vegetables .	1	1
1	my family visited the restaurant recently .	1	1
1	terrible .	1	1
1	this airport is not the best .	1	1
1	i 'd give this joint zero stars if it was possible .	1	1
1	it was over cooked and tasteless .	1	1
1	needless to say , we never returned .	1	1
1	there are too many options in uptown .	1	1
1	nothing special .	1	1
1	high prices , watered down drinks , impersonal management .	1	1
1	it tasted exactly like watered down ketchup .	1	1
1	the entrees were dull and lacked seasoning .	1	1
1	never , ever go here .	1	1
1	it was over cooked & the sauce was more soy like than smooth .	1	1
1	ordered cashew chicken , hot and spicy beef and kung pao chicken .	1	1
1	the cheese burgers are quite gross .	1	1
1	horrible service .	1	1
1	lastly , when she took our check , the waitress yet again disappeared .	1	1
1	ugh , i hate this place .	1	1
1	$ _num_ is not working for me .	1	1
1	i 'm sure it is in the liquor license application .	1	1
1	the gravy ( breakfast gravy ) was warm , however everything underneath was cold .	1	1
1	unfortunately , one of these items required a return for an even exchange .	1	1
1	while her sides were delicious she thought the chicken fingers missed the mark .	1	1
1	dirty place and horrible service .	1	1
1	very frustrating overall .	1	1
1	the line was endless and crowded .	1	1
1	i am used to more creativity in rolls and this place was lacking .	1	1
1	i 've had better , cheaper italian elsewhere in charlotte .	1	1
1	my order was $ _num_ .	1	1
1	four star _num_ diamond yea right .	1	1
1	that 's beyond gross and completely unacceptable for a seafood restaurant of that caliber .	1	1
1	i do n't like chains a lot , but some i tolerate .	1	1
1	i will not be returning here for any musical needs .	1	1
1	the biggest problem ?	1	1
1	when i got through , i had to go through security again .	1	1
1	chicken wings where not hot .	1	1
1	but i still cant get over the fact there closed on mondays .	1	1
1	in addition , they offered me tea , coffee , or water .	1	1
1	ordered two spicy chicken combos yesterday at around _num_ o'clock .	1	1
1	looks and taste both scored a _num_ out of _num_ .	1	1
1	it was all i could taste .	1	1
1	run , do not walk away from this place .	1	1
1	security is beyond the worst .	1	1
1	there 's plenty other spots with a lot friendlier staff in charlotte .	1	1
1	needless to say this was not my favorite !	1	1
1	it took about _num_ minutes before we even got our drinks .	1	1
1	this is a very poorly maintained airport but yet , somehow a major hub .	1	1
1	do n't get scammed like i did .	1	1
1	the disappointment was it was over-cooked .	1	1
1	probably not .	1	1
1	but that 's where the good stops ... unfortunately .	1	1
1	the food was not very good to my husband and i .	1	1
1	that might make it a little better .	1	1
1	the bread was thick and doughy ( clearly a filler ) .	1	1
1	but after what happened i will never be back .	1	1
1	not super bad service , but i 've certainly had better .	1	1
1	they do n't take debit or credit cards .	1	1
1	it was n't even decent enough for one star .	1	1
1	i 'm just now getting over this horrible stomach bug caused by his place .	1	1
1	and i did n't have as many side choices ?	1	1
1	i have never received worse customer service .	1	1
1	i also should have known that i should n't have cheated on my diet .	1	1
1	no such luck : it came on her sandwich just like everyone else .	1	1
1	but the attitude of this place could be better .	1	1
1	desert choices were flourless chocolate cake and cheesecake .	1	1
1	the spaghetti and meatballs were very bland .	1	1
1	but i ended up with the chicken broccoli alfredo , nothing to rave about .	1	1
1	the milk pitcher was never once refilled .	1	1
1	if only the free wifi worked more than it did n't .	1	1
1	we called to make appointments together and the receptionist was rude !	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	but last night it took _num_ hrs to get a burger .	1	1
1	she said she would get it changed .	1	1
1	first , our waitress went missing a few times .	1	1
1	the background check is only required for long guns .	1	1
1	cardboard with a strange tangy sauce and a side of disaster .	1	1
1	i could barely pick the shrimp out because the sauce was that gross .	1	1
1	this dish was smothered in sauce and had no flavor .	1	1
1	do n't even get me started .	1	1
1	- no visible signs of bed bugs .	1	1
1	the `` ambiance '' is loud , dark , dingy and depressing .	1	1
1	you might get better service at the chilis too in the same airport .	1	1
1	the mechanic says basic .	1	1
1	however i do not plan on visiting another burger king any time soon .	1	1
1	the place was empty when we got there and when we left .	1	1
1	before i talked to them , i could change channels and had a picture .	1	1
1	will not go back .	1	1
1	god turned water into wine well i will never be back .	1	1
1	that is just wrong .	1	1
1	really , you do n't know the answer to that simple question ?	1	1
1	ridiculous policies and move out fees .	1	1
1	i really was n't thrilled with our meal here .	1	1
1	to be honest i was offended and just shook my head .	1	1
1	food is limited and all fried , that 's not a good thing either .	1	1
1	i sadly had to throw most of it away .	1	1
1	my wife ended up going to the bathroom for paper towels .	1	1
1	if so , then you 'll want to take a pass on this place .	1	1
1	we lucked out and go on the shuttle over without waiting in the cold .	1	1
1	when it was not on , we went back to the counter .	1	1
1	i have eaten here several times & always find it disappointing .	1	1
1	horribly under staffed .	1	1
1	excuse me for wanting to try your establishment .	1	1
1	food was terrible .	1	1
1	needless to say , i will not go here again .	1	1
1	i used to frequent v cleaners & alterations .	1	1
1	the staff is unfriendly and rude .	1	1
1	it was cold and soggy .	1	1
1	it took _num_ minutes to get drinks !	1	1
1	i felt like i was asking an enemy for a favor .	1	1
1	my home warranty company gave me the number to carolina appliance service .	1	1
1	our waitress was mia most of the night .	1	1
1	also , the home fries were just mediocre .	1	1
1	the food sucks .	1	1
1	ok , i just ate a science project .	1	1
1	my soup was alright - french onion - pretty standard .	1	1
1	after all it is taco bell .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	to be fair , our assigned server was very nice .	1	1
1	wo n't be returning .	1	1
1	cut me off while talking , was not listening , their loss .	1	1
1	it 's definitely not the worst i 've ever had .	1	1
1	i came in tonight ready to buy a bike .	1	1
1	the restaurant across the street was apparently a night club as well .	1	1
1	walls are very thin and you can hear casual conversations of guests next door .	1	1
1	the meat in the steak sandwich was like dog food .	1	1
1	i literally had my soup and salad delivered within _num_ seconds of each other .	1	1
1	we went to have a snack and wait til the next round .	1	1
1	i 've complained numerous times but it never does any good .	1	1
1	never again , they are off my list .	1	1
1	well , that 's not entirely true .	1	1
1	which i was , and i was not allowed in .	1	1
1	the highlight of the meal actually was dessert .	1	1
1	_num_ hour later it was completed .	1	1
1	no breaking of the ice .	1	1
1	the guy does n't know what he is doing .	1	1
1	she also spent the entire time trying to up sell me .	1	1
1	the flavor was missing and the entire meal was just bland .	1	1
1	i would highly encourage others to go elsewhere .	1	1
1	my son and i then tasted it ... understood the face after that .	1	1
1	never again will i go to this location .	1	1
1	would n't recommend going out of your way for a slice .	1	1
1	the iced tea is also terrible tasting .	1	1
1	park is n't very clean .	1	1
1	i was unable to justify spending $ _num_ or $ _num_ for their membership .	1	1
1	some of the walkways seem narrow but that could be just me .	1	1
1	i should have stayed home and made pizza myself .	1	1
1	i repeat , this is a station review !	1	1
1	i was so glad it was over .	1	1
1	i will not be going back any time soon .	1	1
1	it was cold and tasted very old .	1	1
1	i really wanted to write a good review , but the experience was disappointing .	1	1
1	- workers : rude , rude , rude .	1	1
1	i 'm barely decent on the track but geez .	1	1
1	seems he was already looking to replace the manager .	1	1
1	the chocolate cake was cold & hard .	1	1
1	ordered a grilled chicken salad , take out .	1	1
1	then , i ate here .	1	1
1	?	1	1
1	for $ _num_ , i could do a better job in my garage .	1	1
1	we were a party of _num_ adults and _num_ kid .	1	1
1	my bill : $ _num_ .	1	1
1	we immediately left and frankly its not worth going back again .	1	1
1	now the bad ... stains .	1	1
1	actually all of the staff i encountered in my _num_ days here were great .	1	1
1	not even close .	1	1
1	zero stars for price .	1	1
1	this place is disgusting .	1	1
1	i went out with three others on a friday night to grab some dinner .	1	1
1	i could not even eat one !	1	1
1	there was nothing really special about the food .	1	1
1	the food was good but the shrimp and grits are not good .	1	1
1	it really takes over and you hardly taste the quality of the other ingredients .	1	1
1	never ... have my prescriptions ever been ready on time .	1	1
1	_num_ star .	1	1
1	sorry to say that will be my last visit .	1	1
1	if you 're anything else , there are better options in uptown .	1	1
1	we will still go here just not try to eat .	1	1
1	unfortunately the service is very hit or miss .	1	1
1	unacceptable .	1	1
1	disgusting .	1	1
1	and the underwhelming food sealed the deal .	1	1
1	disgusting .	1	1
1	there are no overhead signs warning you of this .	1	1
1	she then told me it only comes with cheese .	1	1
1	pittsburgh is known for their worst transportation !	1	1
1	really do n't get the high praise for their pizza .	1	1
1	not cool !	1	1
1	for many , many years i had the same massage therapist .	1	1
1	i 'll give it another _num_ months and try again .	1	1
1	it was n't good at all .	1	1
1	they place no value on customer satisfaction .	1	1
1	i 've taken my car here at least twice .	1	1
1	the service was ok , not the best not the worst .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	neither of us were n't very happy about this .	1	1
1	long wait time for initial service and drink refills .	1	1
1	the steak was tough and tasteless .	1	1
1	they hired people that had to be required to do certain areas correctly .	1	1
1	this has to be the worst restaurant at the waterfront .	1	1
1	honestly , there were _num_ people in the restaurant .	1	1
1	i do n't know how this keeps happening .	1	1
1	two grape size tomatoes , and two thin slices of cucumber .	1	1
1	i could n't hear the people at my own table it was so loud .	1	1
1	neither of us touched our food .	1	1
1	this visit was n't horrible , but definitely kinda unpleasant .	1	1
1	i chose the hot and sour soup .	1	1
1	the main reason for the low rating was the service .	1	1
1	he did the total opposite .	1	1
1	the only compensation we got were $ _num_ game cards .	1	1
1	took another _num_ minutes to get the drinks .	1	1
1	extremely disappointed in this dish .	1	1
1	kids got hot dogs , ugh , just buy a better brand people !	1	1
1	no other reason this facility will deserve anything less than _num_ stars .	1	1
1	i do n't see a return in my future .	1	1
1	bill came to $ _num_ .	1	1
1	our meal was $ _num_ and probably should have cost around $ _num_ .	1	1
1	he gave me a more reasonable price .	1	1
1	enterprise .	1	1
1	when did this place get expensive ?	1	1
1	the worst .	1	1
1	would that have been so difficult ?	1	1
1	no thanks .	1	1
1	i waited two hours today in the freezing cold to get to work .	1	1
1	i looked down and saw dirty toe nails and finger nails on the floor .	1	1
1	nina the manager and ashley the cashier extremely rude .	1	1
1	way too over priced .	1	1
1	at first i thought maybe it was a fluke .	1	1
1	this alone i would have given _num_ stars .	1	1
1	i assure you this place is n't it .	1	1
1	she ended up sitting on my lap to eat .	1	1
1	this literally is the worst restaurant i 've been to my entire life .	1	1
1	the person could n't get the information right .	1	1
1	the waitress was very curt and disrespectful .	1	1
1	so , we ordered the veal and chicken parm .	1	1
1	then , they are n't even that nice !	1	1
1	i 'm never coming back to a denny 's .	1	1
1	gross !	1	1
1	disappointing .	1	1
1	they will not get another dime of mine .	1	1
1	it was n't a memorable meal or experience .	1	1
1	could not eat it .	1	1
1	it was so bad , i would not dear to try again .	1	1
1	i left extremely upset and no one cared .	1	1
1	the coin operated laundry was another in consistent experience .	1	1
1	it was a huge pile of spaghetti in a bowl .	1	1
1	the baked in house bread were blah , and butter was not offered .	1	1
1	everything was severely overcooked and just plain bad in the ceviche .	1	1
1	my eyebrow still has n't grown back to its normal shape .	1	1
1	terrible customer service !	1	1
1	did n't file straight or smooth .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	people just seemed to be standing around this whole place for no reason .	1	1
1	the location is also horrible .	1	1
1	waited about _num_ - _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	no longer are available are the thai spring rolls with peanut sauce .	1	1
1	horrible customer service .	1	1
1	guy on the front desk has the attitude problem .	1	1
1	i would give them zero stars if that was an option .	1	1
1	Negative	1	1
1	plus do n't even try complaining to guest services .	1	1
1	do n't waste your time with this place .	1	1
1	just sad there customer service sucks .	1	1
1	_num_ there service is awful , _num_ there prices are awful .	1	1
1	ordered , is not .	1	1
1	and then the waitress only brought two of the three beverages .	1	1
1	while we wait our fries are sitting on b the tray getting cold .	1	1
1	the desk staff immediately found me another room .	1	1
1	after one person took a bite the sour faces were hard to miss !	1	1
1	managers and workers are rude and condescending .	1	1
1	so , i came to the diner having already eaten a light breakfast .	1	1
1	i was excited about dining at this place before _num_ minutes of frustration .	1	1
1	dude thought he should argue with me about it so i got a refund .	1	1
1	my to go meal ended up being $ _num_ bucks after taxes and tip .	1	1
1	well it is a sunday night and the crowd is not here .	1	1
1	it was made of wood .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	we used to visit this place most every time we went to pittsburgh .	1	1
1	do you like egg & bacon bagel sandwiches ?	1	1
1	no customer service .	1	1
1	if i could give _num_ stars i would .	1	1
1	the pasta i got was good , but nothing to write home about .	1	1
1	was n't impressed .	1	1
1	i have never seen such a horrible community college in my life time .	1	1
1	not worth the money .	1	1
1	ordered a very a very large and heavy coat rack .	1	1
1	_num_ sundaes were $ _num_ .	1	1
1	i pointed out that there is a grocery store within walking distance .	1	1
1	old , old fruit for my garnish in my drink .	1	1
1	i would n't recommend this one if you 're in a rush .	1	1
1	however , i decided not to purchase it from this store .	1	1
1	go to meat & potatoes instead , and order a sandwich there .	1	1
1	and the women 's locker room was nasty .	1	1
1	i wish i had done the same .	1	1
1	no excuse .	1	1
1	i did n't get what i ordered .	1	1
1	the quality of the furniture turned out to be very poor .	1	1
1	she told me there was a charge for the dressing on the side .	1	1
1	i had an emergency on the morning i was leaving for europe .	1	1
1	so on to the hoagies , the italian is general run of the mill .	1	1
1	i wo n't be back .	1	1
1	on top of it , i got so sick .	1	1
1	so glad i did n't send the kids on ahead to the pool .	1	1
1	i did n't get it .	1	1
1	as dinner was my treat , i felt very awkward asking for prices .	1	1
1	the lettuce tastes old and rubbery ... not in this case .	1	1
1	did n't even get time under the warmer .	1	1
1	i said he was being rude to my mother , a paying customer .	1	1
1	at 1:30 i asked about my vehicle and was told i was next .	1	1
1	when she delivered their food there was not a single mention of the delay .	1	1
1	i could n't believe it .	1	1
1	the delivery driver arrived about _num_ minutes later .	1	1
1	if i wanted them in _num_ days i would have paid $ _num_ less !	1	1
1	none of these _num_ parents will ever return .	1	1
1	terrible service and experience !	1	1
1	only _num_ stars for location .	1	1
1	now , maybe you do n't care .	1	1
1	however , you have no set vet there , as far as i know .	1	1
1	furthermore , i would rather drive _num_ minutes more to concord to race there .	1	1
1	did not like it .	1	1
1	because that was the rude person taking my order .	1	1
1	kind of gross if you ask me .	1	1
1	will not be going back to give them any of my money !	1	1
1	the food is ok but it is really more or less chinese food .	1	1
1	i was horrible .	1	1
1	needless , to say not a great experience .	1	1
1	the buffalo chicken sub was yummy but cold .	1	1
1	pino then literally threw our menu 's at us , and walked away .	1	1
1	i can not review the food .	1	1
1	i do n't normally get my beer from there .	1	1
1	gone is the famous gm bill .	1	1
1	the chili was not very good either and the fries were pretty tasteless .	1	1
1	bland noodles .	1	1
1	gross .	1	1
1	she was very helpful and knowledgeable .	1	1
1	not only was my order wrong but the lady was very grumpy .	1	1
1	for our main dish , we got the large order of spicy chicken rigatoni .	1	1
1	another _num_ minutes later still no food , not even apps .	1	1
1	used to be the best i 've ever had .	1	1
1	terrible .	1	1
1	they did n't even fix it .	1	1
1	super long story short : sub-par food , worse service .	1	1
1	we walked in and it was awkward .	1	1
1	the two bites of my pork belly sandwich were pretty alright though .	1	1
1	they scheduled me an appointment with a specialist two weeks out .	1	1
1	food is n't very good - service is worse .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	you 'll have a much nicer experience .	1	1
1	that 's a problem for another review .	1	1
1	the service itself was n't to great either .	1	1
1	so instead of the rice i ordered a baked potato .	1	1
1	they need to get some help in here or people will stop coming !	1	1
1	we were seated immediately , however our server was not a good one .	1	1
1	owner takes no responsibility for ruining clothing .	1	1
1	so i ordered _num_ for myself and my gf .	1	1
1	boiled pasta would have had more flavor .	1	1
1	very rude .	1	1
1	yep , that description of their `` chorizo '' comes directly off their menu .	1	1
1	what a waste of money !	1	1
1	also , i did n't like the quality of the flatbread .	1	1
1	it was not good .	1	1
1	giving _num_ stars instead of _num_ just cause i 've had worse .	1	1
1	at our table and then left prior to ordering .	1	1
1	this guy is out of control its definitely something wrong with him .	1	1
1	there was lettuce and guac on the side .	1	1
1	when i was given my dish , it was a alfredo sauce .	1	1
1	also products are crappy also .	1	1
1	so needless to say we will not be returning back to this establishment ever !	1	1
1	they are usually friendly though .	1	1
1	and i would n't have minded if the food had been amazing .	1	1
1	we will never return to a ruth 's chris steakhouse .	1	1
1	one was apple pie and the other was cheesecake .	1	1
1	the food is only okay .	1	1
1	man , was i wrong .	1	1
1	the pizza was n't that good either .	1	1
1	no big deal , i would have been happy to help out .	1	1
1	this is no mike and tony 's or big greek gyro in market square .	1	1
1	just like the butter and jelly packets sitting in the booth at denny 's .	1	1
1	slow service .	1	1
1	i arrived at charlotte _num_ minutes before my plane was supposed to leave .	1	1
1	bad experience .	1	1
1	one of the people working said that was probably because of `` renovations . ''	1	1
1	from start to finish , the entire evening was a terrible experience .	1	1
1	ordered a gyro and the meat was cold .	1	1
1	)	1	1
1	there was no seasoning , or none noticeable .	1	1
1	i am not an expert but i did n't see the smoky color .	1	1
1	this is a poorly run business that could be turned into something great .	1	1
1	there was no sorry , we 're working on it ... etc .	1	1
1	just go elsewhere .	1	1
1	then the other day , we went back and i tried pizza .	1	1
1	next time your country ass needs to stay home from work .	1	1
1	yet another hertz location that does n't have cars for reservations .	1	1
1	it had fallen on the floor .	1	1
1	however , the service was not up to par today .	1	1
1	so i had high hopes that my _num_ ( ! )	1	1
1	but these corporate suits refused .	1	1
1	wish i could give it less .	1	1
1	i 've had the fried oysters before , and they were pretty good .	1	1
1	soup not hot , waitress and cook fighting loudly .	1	1
1	our total bill was almost $ _num_ .	1	1
1	the cheese is almost too much .	1	1
1	on my own dish i had the classic mac n ' chicken .	1	1
1	the food i ordered was penne alla vodka , which was pretty tasty .	1	1
1	i 've included this very depressing looking `` steak hoagie '' .	1	1
1	atmosphere was awful .	1	1
1	there is no email and i have spent hours on the phone .	1	1
1	you could leave a message , but they 'll never get back to you .	1	1
1	so the air in tire was wasted time .	1	1
1	had such high hopes for this place on our visit to pittsburgh .	1	1
1	the owners do nothing to attempt fixing it up .	1	1
1	no .	1	1
1	i have n't use their service yet .	1	1
1	we got the curry chicken , beef with broccoli , and crab rangoons .	1	1
1	the salads on the menu sound good but taste awful .	1	1
1	really bad .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	when it was addressed , maria stated she will order again .	1	1
1	we will not be going back .	1	1
1	horrible service !	1	1
1	showed up in nc for a business meeting .	1	1
1	plus , the staff is rude .	1	1
1	if you want bland tasteless food , then stop here .	1	1
1	was very disappointed with level of quality and service .	1	1
1	got a full set and the exact same thing happened _num_ days later .	1	1
1	service was indifferent .	1	1
1	literally , the entire store , no bread !	1	1
1	see pics of giant balls of noodles that tasted like the burnt curry .	1	1
1	he showed me the old one and it was black as night .	1	1
1	i really do n't get giant eagle .	1	1
1	disappointed in my queens feast choice .	1	1
1	do n't eat here !	1	1
1	is it possible to give zero stars ?	1	1
1	the loaded baked potato was delicious .	1	1
1	i should have refused delivery and just got my money back .	1	1
1	karen left the color on my hair way too long .	1	1
1	i should n't have to look for something , it should obviously be there .	1	1
1	i was disappointed .	1	1
1	they sent _num_ to a table of two .	1	1
1	too bad , i hope they change cooks .	1	1
1	they give you plenty of food but it is low quality .	1	1
1	i tried one but could not taste the chicken but otherwise it tasted okay .	1	1
1	the only employee i could see in the entire restaurant was the bartender !	1	1
1	um , no ... it was more like garbage sewer sauce .	1	1
1	it was so loud , i jumped out of my seat haha .	1	1
1	i am definitely disappointed .	1	1
1	please avoid this restaurant !	1	1
1	she had smoked wings with ranch dressing , they arrived with barbecue sauce .	1	1
1	servers here can be really rude .	1	1
1	steak was over cooked and the plate was hot but not `` sizzling '' .	1	1
1	the biggest problem i had though was the paper thin walls .	1	1
1	this place is hyped as the be all end all of burgers .	1	1
1	i did not have a great experience in this airport .	1	1
1	awful service , poor attitude , poor food quality .	1	1
1	we will not be going back .	1	1

1	i wo n't come back this unpleasant and pricy restaurant never again .	1	1
1	otherwise , i will never stay at this place .	1	1
1	my main complaint with them is that they lied to me .	1	1
1	nothing to write home about .	1	1
1	being treated extremely rudely by reception was the final straw .	1	1
1	if a cold beer is all you want , go for it .	1	1
1	heavy and bland .	1	1
1	had the $ _num_ lunch and it was exactly what i expected .	1	1
1	and then she said `` no , what kind of dress . ''	1	1
1	i handed it to her and walked out .	1	1
1	disappointing at every turn .	1	1
1	i did n't eat it .	1	1
1	the variety of sauces is what gets me to come back .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	it was unbelievable .	1	1
1	it is overpriced and not worth it .	1	1
1	i would not return based on the lack or respect for my time .	1	1
1	gross .	1	1
1	stay away !	1	1
1	second of all , and more important , the service here is terrible .	1	1
1	i was expecting $ _num_ + $ _num_ salad upgrade .	1	1
1	the coffee maker is disgusting and smells .	1	1
1	this time , gave another shot and tried oysters and shrimp .	1	1
1	do n't trust them with anything you want to keep .	1	1
1	both times ive had the penne alla vodka , once again its pretty mediocre .	1	1
1	i 'm not an idiot , i can see that .	1	1
1	the story does n't end there .	1	1
1	no way will i be back any time soon .	1	1
1	the service can be okay or awful .	1	1
1	the crab cakes were cold and overly salty .	1	1
1	the waitstaff all seems to think highly of themselves .	1	1
1	so when i got back to the office , i went online and checked .	1	1
1	not just a lot , but dripping and soggy .	1	1
1	not the absolute best in charlotte ... but also not the absolute worst .	1	1
1	)	1	1
1	never had a problem calling in orders at any other showmars .	1	1
1	i had the thai beef salad and it had about _num_ strips of beef .	1	1
1	sorry , we will never step foot in here again .	1	1
1	eggplant parm was a little better than average .	1	1
1	if you do , be cautious -- do not give them your email .	1	1
1	unless she is really trying to take over the olive garden market .	1	1
1	ca n't stay in terminal .	1	1
1	any review that says this place is great seriously has not been anywhere .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	this made my food experience not good .	1	1
1	tried again today and were again sorely disappointed .	1	1
1	nigiri sushi was not good at all and neither were the rolls .	1	1
1	the tenders had no seasoning on them .	1	1
1	a year later , the ceiling in my bedroom began to leak .	1	1
1	plus the quality is not great and never replace buttons when broken .	1	1
1	i will not be back .	1	1
1	rude !	1	1
1	terrible customer service and it was my birthday .	1	1
1	i have never been to a less taken care of establishment .	1	1
1	aside from the poor service and chaos , the food was pretty good .	1	1
1	not my scene .	1	1
1	we should 've just went some where else .	1	1
1	it was runny and bland .	1	1
1	i was grateful for justin since he was the most helpful to me .	1	1
1	rode my bike out to meet my old man .	1	1
1	just so rude .	1	1
1	so we called back and asked for our money back .	1	1
1	this is by far the worst motel _num_ i 've ever stayed in .	1	1
1	did n't clean under my nails after lotion .	1	1
1	but this gives me the chance to tell you how terrible the cannoli was .	1	1
1	not professional at all .	1	1
1	it 's no where close to `` cream of '' anything .	1	1
1	i was shocked at the foul language coming from both of them .	1	1
1	gross !	1	1
1	they 're out of bacon , yes bacon !	1	1
1	the sauces are not good and they are constantly rushing you .	1	1
1	made a reservation in june for july .	1	1
1	bad service , bad cars , not recommended .	1	1
1	you play russian roulette with your quarters every time .	1	1
1	due to 3-4 hours of service i split it into two days .	1	1
1	horrible dinner .	1	1
1	cajun queen was n't awful , but it was n't great either .	1	1
1	there is no excuse for the poor service and food .	1	1
1	the scallops were hard , over cooked .	1	1
1	terrible customer service , disrespectful in fact .	1	1
1	sadly i havent got my food quicker than _num_ minutes at this location .	1	1
1	i thought it was odd how many empty tables were in the bar area .	1	1
1	disgusting .	1	1
1	food was not good .	1	1
1	avoid this terrible hertz .	1	1
1	first time in pittsburgh , from chicago .	1	1
1	service was slow for soup and a salad .	1	1
1	ridiculous .	1	1
1	one word ; gross .	1	1
1	do n't go here for anything but the walls and music .	1	1
1	i mean thats absurd to charge these prices !	1	1
1	room does not look like hotels.com photos .	1	1
1	the food is gross , along with the decor & especially the carpet .	1	1
1	by this point we 've been waiting for _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	do not stay st this hotel .	1	1
1	overall poor service .	1	1
1	food was only ok , but good portions for the price .	1	1
1	the only thing i will give them credit for their italian wedding soup .	1	1
1	night manager tried to enter my room at _num_ am while i was sleeping .	1	1
1	seems like they have enough customers and do not need to be nice anymore .	1	1
1	i tried the seared ahi tuna .	1	1
1	just getting off work , i came alone .	1	1
1	there was no asian table or house workers in the front side of things .	1	1
1	ca n't understand the big secret about that one .	1	1
1	the us air passenger service agents are complete jerks .	1	1
1	i do n't even care about the decor or seating etc .	1	1
1	worst parking lot in pittsburgh .	1	1
1	the beer was decent , it 's just draft beer here .	1	1
1	i kindly sent it back .	1	1
1	the ritz ... and then what ?	1	1
1	if i could give it _num_ stars i would .	1	1
1	nothing special .	1	1
1	i ordered smoked pork chops , home fries and green beans .	1	1
1	naturally , i get an automatic voicemail .	1	1
1	we were so looking forward to the food but our experience was awful .	1	1
1	meaning , i never saw her full face .	1	1
1	just checked it out for the first time .	1	1
1	six days and it cost _num_ dollars .	1	1
1	the ice cream looked old , and after trying it , tasted like nothing .	1	1
1	he got buffalo tacos and the tortilla 's were not even warm .	1	1
1	she is like you said no meat .	1	1
1	do not rent here .	1	1
1	he told me i had about _num_ minutes to get it .	1	1
1	do n't waste your time coming here .	1	1
1	i sat down in the chair for pedicure .	1	1
1	no more smoking allowed .	1	1
1	i refuse to patronize any business that only accepts cash .	1	1
1	after almost an hour of waiting , i still had no pizza .	1	1
1	none of this was provided upon arrival .	1	1
1	in the end , that bridesmaid got a partial refund for the dress .	1	1
1	even the rolls were almost stale .	1	1
1	i went back to the counter to find a different manager .	1	1
1	the fries that went along with it were also extremely salty .	1	1
1	after five minutes of not seeing any hostess , we left .	1	1
1	but the place was disgusting and the cashier was incredibly rude .	1	1
1	Neutral	1	1
1	there are better restaurants to frequent .	1	1
1	i am extremely disappointed .	1	1
1	this is the first time i feel compelled to write a bad review .	1	1
1	clt is one of american airlines hub and it 's extremely crowded .	1	1
1	the food was okay but lacked the spices and taste .	1	1
1	because i usually judge a restaurant for being authentic if their own people go .	1	1
1	would i go here again ?	1	1
1	i do n't know what this sausage was other then disgusting .	1	1
1	i left with _num_ finger bleeding , _num_ nails on crooked and skimpy polish .	1	1
1	i could not agree more that this is so funny .	1	1
1	cant wait to move on .	1	1
1	what horrible service this place gives !	1	1
1	still the general manager has not returned a phone call or a text message .	1	1
1	no apologies .	1	1
1	needless to say , i will never come back here again .	1	1
1	apps were cold .	1	1
1	um , i 'm not asking you to help me sort things .	1	1
1	on a tuesday night , there was a long wait .	1	1
1	avoid at all costs !	1	1
1	lost sale opportunity .	1	1
1	sandwiches and burgers do not come with fries or anything .	1	1
1	i guess i will now wait another _num_ weeks to get this problem solved .	1	1
1	she reluctantly gave me the owners name .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	i would n't call this place authentic korean bbq .	1	1
1	nope , it said $ _num_ for a master stylist women 's haircut .	1	1
1	then my wife and i went to the restroom to wash our hands .	1	1
1	there was no flavor , and the skin was not crispy .	1	1
1	he was rude and had no interest in serving us .	1	1
1	so consider my advice if you decide to purchase here .	1	1
1	my room was n't clean when we got back to the hotel .	1	1
1	no drinks .	1	1
1	do n't bother going .	1	1
1	the waitress was so impatient .	1	1
1	the worst hertz location i 've dealt with !	1	1
1	the fries were bad .	1	1
1	went here and of course had the worst experience getting my bridesmaid dress .	1	1
1	i still do n't understand why they served their fancy cream soda warm .	1	1
1	they refilled our glasses only once , after we had asked for the check .	1	1
1	sat down and he brought out egg noodles and duck sauce .	1	1
1	stuck in my lease until february .	1	1
1	however , staff was nice and accommodating .	1	1
1	there were no other veggies or anything .	1	1
1	disappointed with the quality of the food .	1	1
1	my reuben sandwich was just okay .	1	1
1	if you 're comparing it to any other modern airport it is substandard .	1	1
1	i really have no idea what it is .	1	1
1	_num_ stars .	1	1
1	easily takes _num_ min to get a drink .	1	1
1	a bit confusing layout , but tastefully done .	1	1
1	they had _num_ hostess up front doing nothing and did n't even greet us .	1	1
1	seem nice but the food is not that good .	1	1
1	ghetto staff means lack of caring !	1	1
1	its downright awful and has been for awhile .	1	1
1	i of course had filet , and i was just so underwhelmed with it .	1	1
1	my real complaint is just how rudely we were treated at both locations .	1	1
1	i will never be back .	1	1
1	no thanks .	1	1
1	alexander 's offers some of the worst italian food i 've ever had .	1	1
1	i guess all customers are n't equal .	1	1
1	parking at the hotel is expensive .	1	1
1	it was n't the best meal as far as service was concerned .	1	1
1	after an hour of waiting , i called to check on our order .	1	1
1	worst pedicure and gel manicure ever !	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	even without grumpy old man , there 's nothing special about this place .	1	1
1	no refund .	1	1
1	sooo wrong .	1	1
1	yeah , do n't order from here , unless it 's for dumplings .	1	1
1	i did n't know hamburgers were traditional italian fare .	1	1
1	very bad service .	1	1
1	service was slow , but there was only one waitress in the restaurant .	1	1
1	most of his seafood was also overcooked and tasteless .	1	1
1	not horrible , just nothing to write home about .	1	1
1	so probably expecting too much .	1	1
1	very disappointing .	1	1
1	service sucked food was nasty as i dont know what .	1	1
1	plus the bread was poor quality .	1	1
1	if you 've got stuff to do , do n't bother coming here .	1	1
1	i liked the bar .	1	1
1	worst fast food i 've ever been to .	1	1
1	not the best or the worst mall in charlotte .	1	1
1	the younger girl did them and did a bad job .	1	1
1	it 's just bad .	1	1
1	what a disappointment .	1	1
1	and trying to get our check ?	1	1
1	walked in and got an app .	1	1
1	possibly the worst overpriced pizza there is .	1	1
1	i looked around and there were only _num_ other people in the entire restaurant .	1	1
1	very poor quality work .	1	1
1	i do n't know .	1	1
1	however , the crepes are extremely over price .	1	1
1	i rarely write negative reviews .	1	1
1	most restaurants charge per bottle , not per person .	1	1
1	horrible drink ( old fashioned ) ?	1	1
1	i really like their fried chicken , coleslaw , potato salad and other dishes .	1	1
1	they were packed and could n't keep enough food out .	1	1
1	it was terrible .	1	1
1	this is not a really cool hang out .	1	1
1	i was searching for an independent little place to pick up dog food .	1	1
1	ridiculous .	1	1
1	worst thing was the loud dance music .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	the total was $ _num_ and change .	1	1
1	i ordered the flat iron steak , which came smothered in a spicy sauce .	1	1
1	this food is just crap .	1	1
1	therefore i addressed it the next day they refused to fix it .	1	1
1	good food , but rude service on the phone and in person .	1	1
1	no one that works there can do anything about it .	1	1
1	i am hoping that my experience here was an off night .	1	1
1	because of number two our service in general was not good .	1	1
1	but starting 2-3 years ago the food went downhill .	1	1
1	the employees could have cared less as well .	1	1
1	nothing special .	1	1
1	i ordered the country sausage potatoes , pumpkin pancakes & grits .	1	1
1	beef pieces were small .	1	1
1	i 'd recommend stopping in another giant eagle if you can .	1	1
1	spicy tuna rolls were not fresh and smelled like fish .	1	1
1	good bagels , but it had horrible customer service .	1	1
1	it all had no taste !	1	1
1	the smell from when i got the food was just not appetizing .	1	1
1	not impressed .	1	1
1	mediocre at best .	1	1
1	very poor service and atmosphere .	1	1
1	nothing special , it is kmart after all .	1	1
1	the coffee was expensive and tasted like dirt .	1	1
1	wo n't be going back .	1	1
1	um no , its like $ _num_ extra for delivery .	1	1
1	no wonder it is for sale .	1	1
1	i 've been here twice and i 'm just not crazy about it .	1	1
1	the server takes my plate , and says they would make it right .	1	1
1	not impressed .	1	1
1	dim lighting that makes me want to sleep .	1	1
1	it looked like it was under cooked .	1	1
1	this place clearly had no care for customer service or business .	1	1
1	good store - rude owners and employees .	1	1
1	although i 'm not a burger person , theirs was pretty tasty .	1	1
1	the food was cold both times .	1	1
1	it was all kind of meh to me .	1	1
1	both the smell and sight were quite disgusting .	1	1
1	the only thing that made it somewhat decent was sour cream and guacamole .	1	1
1	it 's never cold , never .	1	1
1	manager never came back to tell us that all were reserved for others .	1	1
1	my friend was not rude , not disrespectful , just looking to order food .	1	1
1	we could not get it together because it did n't line up .	1	1
1	ridiculous .	1	1
1	i was scheduled to bring my car in but it would not start .	1	1
1	i only stayed one night and was charged twice .	1	1
1	i can only believe it 's because there are no other deli 's downtown .	1	1
1	mediocre food .	1	1
1	they were sold out at 2:00 pm on a thursday .	1	1
1	well my reuben had barely had any meat and no _num_ island dressing .	1	1
1	i made sure i asked for extra sauce ( just in case ) .	1	1
1	the staff would not know i had once asked for that room .	1	1
1	she was busy and nice ... still just took along time .	1	1
1	they were served with a side of bland , instant rice and black beans .	1	1
1	no biggie because it happens from time to time .	1	1
1	run , do n't walk , away from carmel family physicians !	1	1
1	i ordered seared ahi tuna salad .	1	1
1	our expectations were not too high and the restaurant delivered just that .	1	1
1	maybe i 'm just bitter .	1	1
1	most we had to wait was _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	i would n't trust them with a pair of socks .	1	1
1	the waitstaff go out of their way to not help you .	1	1
1	there is no lobby to hold people before a show .	1	1
1	worst place ever !	1	1
1	now i 'm sad , real sad .	1	1
1	hell , tgi friday 's would have been better .	1	1
1	todd 's flowers on central ave is out of business .	1	1
1	she was generally nice and probably embarrassed for serving such crappy food .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	no hint of a smile on her face .	1	1
1	i just wish that 's who we would 've went to first .	1	1
1	ridiculous .	1	1
1	this store is so gross that i was almost sick !	1	1
1	first off , it is desperately in need of some updates .	1	1
1	the toppings on my salad were barely there .	1	1
1	not impressed with the food .	1	1
1	the crab cakes were so disgusting my husband and i had to switch meals .	1	1
1	they really have nothing here i ca n't get somewhere i like better .	1	1
1	it is cheap food , and you get what you pay for .	1	1
1	the chicken itself was mediocre at best .	1	1
1	always so busy coming through here .	1	1
1	do n't believe me ?	1	1
1	it 's a slow night so i took them off the table .	1	1
1	sad , cause i always was a fan of this company .	1	1
1	the pork chop was so bitter and dry .	1	1
1	the pizzas my husband and i ordered were mediocre .	1	1
1	i tasted the pizza and the crust was undercooked and burnt on the edges .	1	1
1	but it turned out to be a real bad experience .	1	1
1	the manager was also talking with the employees in a loud and inappropriate way .	1	1
1	if you 're white , do n't bother .	1	1
1	absolutely horrible customer service .	1	1
1	probably not ordering from here again .	1	1
1	_num_ ) the fried chicken was n't really fried .	1	1
1	i get there and the place is chaotic .	1	1
1	all in all , this was a negative experience .	1	1
1	also ordered beef & mixed vegetable , meh .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	as usual it was mediocre at best .	1	1
1	the slaw was crunchy and fresh , but it too was bland .	1	1
1	$ _num_ locker .	1	1
1	it is clear that this is not her main priority .	1	1
1	i do not understand the hype about this place .	1	1
1	but i highly doubt we 'll make our way there any time soon .	1	1
1	just bad .	1	1
1	the food you need to be careful , because sometimes they are expired .	1	1
1	ugh , my coworker spread open the spinach leaf .	1	1
1	i will never return to red roof in .	1	1
1	another disappointment .	1	1
1	each day they also have a $ _num_ lunch special .	1	1
1	ordered twice in the last _num_ days and both times it was terrible .	1	1
1	i gave half of it to my husband to eat .	1	1
1	the waiter said she only comes to town twice a year .	1	1
1	no mild salsa , no rice ... ... why bother !	1	1
1	park _num_ cafe is under new management .	1	1
1	the water was very hard .	1	1
1	again not a real problem just one part of the entire experience .	1	1
1	every employee that works at this pizza hut needs to be fired .	1	1
1	it 's clear auto only cares about quantity not quality .	1	1
1	now , their service : really lackluster .	1	1
1	what a bummer to spend that much money and be that underwhelmed .	1	1
1	wo n't be back .	1	1
1	that makes me so sad knowing i will never experience that wonderful flavor again .	1	1
1	he said no because we didnt discuss it .	1	1
1	it was a tofu , vegetables , and wide rice noodles entree .	1	1
1	the runny quinoa was a mess and hard to boot .	1	1
1	after paying my bill i waited for my change that never came .	1	1
1	when she returned it was only a bill for the martini .	1	1
1	do not use their car wash .	1	1
1	then the ultimate insult : _num_ kids came in selling candy bars .	1	1
1	he had never been and what better way to try out a new restaurant .	1	1
1	no , we did not order any super fancy dishes .	1	1
1	the place was noisy and it was pricey .	1	1
1	this is probably one of the worst olive garden i have been to .	1	1
1	barely ate any of either serving .	1	1
1	we went back in the main door , clearly confused .	1	1
1	service was very poor , the minute we stepped in .	1	1
1	the clams were served raw with a burnt bread crumb topping .	1	1
1	obviously management is not training well for customer service at this location .	1	1
1	the fries were horrible .	1	1
1	very slow service !	1	1
1	when i asked the receptionist where the stylist was , she did n't know .	1	1
1	also , no credit or debit cards here .	1	1
1	the last time that we went there he had our car for over week .	1	1
1	i only eat the hot and sour the night we ordered our take out .	1	1
1	the pool is never clean .	1	1
1	the chicken wings were absolutely horrid .	1	1
1	rice was over cooked .	1	1
1	i got a chicken noodle soup and he got the seafood calzone .	1	1
1	the big green salad was boring and everything was in huge chunks .	1	1
1	oh and the free wifi is horrible !	1	1
1	interesting old house feel to the place .	1	1
1	some of the food on the buffet is quite good .	1	1
1	when i walked in i gave them my name and paid for my order .	1	1
1	it was even slightly cold before i reheated it .	1	1
1	no flavor .	1	1
1	the rib eye was thinly cut , salty and dry .	1	1
1	sushi was mushy .	1	1
1	i really do n't have much desire to go here !	1	1
1	this michael 's location is a disaster .	1	1
1	i gave this location multiple chances .	1	1
1	service was good but probably the worse pizza i 've ever had .	1	1
1	there 're not much options on the menu .	1	1
1	but no .	1	1
1	a few uninterested waiters wandering in back .	1	1
1	the fried green tomatoes were blah .	1	1
1	it is expensive .	1	1
1	why on earth would anyone pay that kind of money ?	1	1
1	drinks are not made properly and the draft beer was warm .	1	1
1	i try calling bj 's and wait over _num_ minutes on hold .	1	1
1	the parking lot is a bit weird to access .	1	1
1	what a terrible experience .	1	1
1	terrible customer service .	1	1
1	food remains ok but prices have more than doubled .	1	1
1	ok i said i was sorry .	1	1
1	the food was terrible !	1	1
1	came here later in the evening on a weekday to an empty building .	1	1
1	_num_ ) $ _num_ tip even though the owner is the server .	1	1
1	i am sure chin 's would not be on their list .	1	1
1	the mozzarella was unremarkable , deep friend mozzarella in breading .	1	1
1	they do n't even really serve breakfast .	1	1
1	i now have roaches and my apartment has already been sprayed once .	1	1
1	the prices are too high for the quality .	1	1
1	i see why this place is hurting for business .	1	1
1	well , it was n't horrible but it also did n't blow me away .	1	1
1	then , i went to go hang out with my best friend immediately after .	1	1
1	the place was empty .	1	1
1	i am incredibly horrified by this place and will never come back .	1	1
1	do n't bother eating here .	1	1
1	their prices are cheap , and our food was just ok .	1	1
1	will not stay here again !	1	1
1	i was exceptionally disappointed .	1	1
1	after all day i never received a shipping confirmation so i called again .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	maybe we had a bad taste in our mouth already .	1	1
1	the macaroni and cheese ... well it was mostly cheese and not much macaroni .	1	1
1	what they said was `` i do n't know what you 're talking about .	1	1
1	first off , i never right reviews unless it 's positive .	1	1
1	it 's chewy biscuit drenched in honey butter and served at room temperature .	1	1
1	i 'll be back to d & d but not to the wine room !	1	1
1	cons : extremely inconsistent room cleaning service !	1	1
1	if i could give negative stars i would .	1	1
1	had no desire to eat throughout the day .	1	1
1	worst chinese food in pittsburgh !	1	1
1	i would give this bk a _num_ star if i could .	1	1
1	i do n't hold it against the attendant .	1	1
1	they brought the wrong one again .	1	1
1	most places allow return of items within _num_ days , even if a mattress .	1	1
1	all i tasted was burnt oil .	1	1
1	worst airport i 've ever been through .	1	1
1	they missed an opportunity to impress a new customer .	1	1
1	the issue was how grossly understaffed they were .	1	1
1	outside of that bar louie leaves a lot to be desired .	1	1
1	raspberry sauce is sitting out on my counter as i continue eating cake .	1	1
1	the only negative was the lack of trays .	1	1
1	grossly overpriced .	1	1
1	either they do n't carry it or i could n't find it .	1	1
1	it gets worse .	1	1
1	i stopped on the way to the theatre , to grab a bite .	1	1
1	it would have been nice to know whom .	1	1
1	then , i go to check out , my dinner was $ _num_ .	1	1
1	do n't take your cat here .	1	1
1	fairly basic .	1	1
1	if that 's a bust , so much for cajun in charlotte .	1	1
1	this in no way makes up for the horrible stench of this place .	1	1
1	verizon is going to lose customers for this .	1	1
1	one other person tried it and would not eat it .	1	1
1	my changs spare ribs were just northern style ribs with bbq sauce on them .	1	1
1	i do n't know whats worse , terrible service or this filthy venue .	1	1
1	boring sandwich .	1	1
1	truly , if at all possible , avoid her !	1	1
1	the biggest thing is they lost the money !	1	1
1	i feel as though i needed to write this review .	1	1
1	thanks but no thanks !	1	1
1	the food here was greasy , uninspired and bland .	1	1
1	the service was more awkward than attentive .	1	1
1	not a bad place to get your nails done .	1	1
1	my boyfriend ordered the salmon creole with cabbage and a garden salad .	1	1
1	yes it 's true greyhound really needs to train their employees higher customer satisfaction .	1	1
1	the service provided by a chinese man was terrible !	1	1
1	did n't expect much from pizza hut .	1	1
1	you pay fees , they make laundry and garbage more and more inconvenient .	1	1
1	but it was the attitude of the owner that turned me off the establishment .	1	1
1	it was tasteless , and the fruit center was nothing more than filler .	1	1
1	of course after having a smoke break , she reeked of smoke .	1	1
1	i sent that back , and ordered the sea bass .	1	1
1	we did n't do the lay river however because the lines were ridiculous .	1	1
1	i had a bite of a chocolate torte , and was very impressed .	1	1
1	i felt bad for the hostess .	1	1
1	when my husband spoke to the manager , he could care less about it .	1	1
1	very hurt and upset with this business .	1	1
1	the pad thai was n't bad ... not great , but not bad .	1	1
1	was n't overly impressed with the food or beer selection .	1	1
1	the next issue is that these walls are paper thin .	1	1
1	prices are n't great for what you 're getting .	1	1
1	i wo n't be back .	1	1
1	i get it .	1	1
1	`` oh ok that 'll be $ _num_ . ''	1	1
1	if you go when it 's busy , beware .	1	1
1	ugh .	1	1
1	was n't great .	1	1
1	my boyfriend 's bison burger was not that tasty either he sent it back .	1	1
1	she invited me back to the restaurant .	1	1
1	all things told , though , i would spend my money elsewhere .	1	1
1	they would n't give me a water for a dollar .	1	1
1	i will never go back to this place again !	1	1
1	california rolls lacked flavor and were quite bland .	1	1
1	i ate it just because i was hungry .	1	1
1	oh , how i wish there was a good seafood restaurant here !	1	1
1	i saw no reason to continue .	1	1
1	been here many times due to its close my house .	1	1
1	the vegetable station was n't appealing .	1	1
1	avoid this airport !	1	1
1	ordered to go and gave clear instructions to have two separate meals .	1	1
1	place is a total joke .	1	1
1	- $ _num_ for chicken tenders and fries ?	1	1
1	it is _num_ pm and the line is past the american check in counters .	1	1
1	ours was n't plain and simple .	1	1
1	we both got martinis and the nachos and buffalo spread apps .	1	1
1	unfortunately service and excellent service should go hand and hand .	1	1
1	she just kept trying to cover her ass instead of listening to my concerns .	1	1
1	two hours and i 'm still waiting on a slow sunday night .	1	1
1	worst sashimi experience ever .	1	1
1	we got this hotel room via hotwire at a great price .	1	1
1	who knows , maybe i was going to order a pizza anyway !	1	1
1	looked nothing like the picture .	1	1
1	not very customer service oriented .	1	1
1	they did not explain this to me when i register .	1	1
1	too bad the food was n't good .	1	1
1	this place is awful .	1	1
1	fail on all levels .	1	1
1	bisque was on the salty side , but it was ok with the bread .	1	1
1	this place is a total disappointment .	1	1
1	sadly , no .	1	1
1	no bed side manor .	1	1
1	the hot and sour soup was ok.	1	1
1	the sesame chicken was just okay , as was the general and orange chicken .	1	1
1	we accepted the room , thanked her and went to our room .	1	1
1	i do n't even know where to begin .	1	1
1	the crust was all gummy and the cheese tasted like plastic .	1	1
1	so gross .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	i do n't even see how time warner is even in business !	1	1
1	i really like this shop .	1	1
1	so we again go off in search of someone to help .	1	1
1	people would probably tell me that i 'm expecting too much .	1	1
1	there are many choices in charlotte - do not consider this hotel as one .	1	1
1	no thank you .	1	1
1	that did n't fix it so we took it back again .	1	1
1	the meat is badly burned and cold .	1	1
1	it sounded like she described a bad breakfast joint ... '' oh that place ?	1	1
1	i did n't get sick from it , so that 's a bonus .	1	1
1	`` you know i 'm a good person ill pay you back . ''	1	1
1	will not be back .	1	1
1	worst service in years .	1	1
1	do not bring your car here .	1	1
1	zero stars .	1	1
1	watch out for the angry lady with american airline where you check your bags .	1	1
1	my hubby ordered coffee , cobb salad and filet .	1	1
1	dishonest , poor quality and bad attitude .	1	1
1	one of my least favorite airports .	1	1
1	they told me it was it was because i was booking with the owner .	1	1
1	she rushed me into picking colors for my nails and toes .	1	1
1	left in _num_ minutes and booked room across the street at la quinta .	1	1
1	finally , being open 24/7 is a plus at least .	1	1
1	do n't think the floor has ever been washed .	1	1
1	after taking her to another vet , i was educated about wound care .	1	1
1	zero stars for service .	1	1
1	my sister sent hers back because it was cold .	1	1
1	i would n't recommend this restaurant .	1	1
1	our mild salsa never arrived .	1	1
1	i just need to look for another place for my favorite mexican food .	1	1
1	update !	1	1
1	the shrimp and pasta , however , were cooked well .	1	1
1	having the last part be the worst part did n't help .	1	1
1	screw me over once , shame on you .	1	1
1	i quickly changed my order to buffalo wings .	1	1
1	wrong !	1	1
1	the smell is terrible , like stale cigarette smoke .	1	1
1	it was n't as good as i had hoped .	1	1
1	they do not watch the dance floor which is dj lesson # _num_ .	1	1
1	avoid this location .	1	1
1	)	1	1
1	i reserved a king room and got stuck in a room with two queens .	1	1
1	my guess is that it was that suspect sauce you put on that sandwich .	1	1
1	the walls were dirty , nasty and dingy .	1	1
1	ate at this resturant while on a business trip .	1	1
1	one , quite literally , threw a guy off of the bus for me .	1	1
1	she should probably get fired .	1	1
1	the service was sooo slow .	1	1
1	the bed and pillows were both very firm and uncomfortable .	1	1
1	highly disappointing .	1	1
1	no , my sign was you just walking away , lol wow .	1	1
1	it was n't overly crowded , but it was n't dead either .	1	1
1	overall rating - just an ok .	1	1
1	very disappointing .	1	1
1	and , they make their enchiladas with white cheese which is not authentic mexican .	1	1
1	the lamb burger was also overcooked .	1	1
1	why did n't i get paid then ?	1	1
1	pay for extras that you do n't get when ordering in .	1	1
1	they fixed the flat no problem for $ _num_ .	1	1
1	one thing is a mistake , multiple things being out is bad management somewhere .	1	1
1	this week is the 3rd week .	1	1
1	they 're wrong .	1	1
1	i left them as i was not in a rush .	1	1
1	smoky , but not horribly so .	1	1
1	it was totally different from all other og restaurants i 've visited .	1	1
1	it was so spicy i could n't really taste anything .	1	1
1	pork chop was terrible and food was cold .	1	1
1	nowhere on the dinosaur tickets we purchased does it say anything about that time !	1	1
1	so do n't trust this place and if you want bed bugs .	1	1
1	not sure what people see here but it 's a never again .	1	1
1	the salad has been greatly reduced in size .	1	1
1	very disappointing experience .	1	1
1	after we were seated and ordered our food did not all come out together .	1	1
1	it tasted old and not very sweet .	1	1
1	it was mediocre curry at best .	1	1
1	my bf said his shrimp was ok at best .	1	1
1	the terrible cheese taste from an hour and a half ago ?	1	1
1	all i can say is yuk .	1	1
1	the place just sucked .	1	1
1	or maybe just feel like it .	1	1
1	very unhelpful service and pizzas always arrive 20-30 mins after time given on order .	1	1
1	$ _num_ for a banana split cocktail ?	1	1
1	ordered egg rolls , steamed dumplings , garlic beef and orange chicken .	1	1
1	this place was horrible .	1	1
1	there was absolutely no seasoning on them and they had zero taste .	1	1
1	everything was overpriced ; drinks , entrees , and dessert .	1	1
1	the other woman tell me i owe _num_ dollars a pair !	1	1
1	not made with love .	1	1
1	once to tell me that they could n't do the veggies .	1	1
1	wrong !	1	1
1	it was a very poor cut of meat , with much fat and gristle .	1	1
1	general tso chicken lacks in chicken .	1	1
1	i will give sushi kim another chance because i know others rave about it .	1	1
1	i have been here a couple of times and it does n't change .	1	1
1	one of the worst wendy 's i 've ever experienced .	1	1
1	overall the food was hit or miss .	1	1
1	not crowded but service was quite slow so i took off a star .	1	1
1	but then two waitresses kept coming and going without even looking at me .	1	1
1	he picked the risotto balls they were okay , kinda bland .	1	1
1	it 's hard to beat the atmosphere of this place in the summer .	1	1
1	_num_ . )	1	1
1	my wife got the honey glazed chicken and i got the sichuan beef .	1	1
1	when the bill comes , it is _num_ dollars .	1	1
1	we would n't have tipped that much based on the above comments .	1	1
1	did n't finish this dish .	1	1
1	poor service , high prices , crappy selection .	1	1
1	i probably wo n't be back .	1	1
1	the uptown location is awful .	1	1
1	i think with some mustard this might have been great .	1	1
1	not sure what the problem was but we were very disappointed .	1	1
1	get your hosts and servers on the same page !	1	1
1	the workers are not greek chefs and are very condescending .	1	1
1	i hate bank of america more than anything else in the world .	1	1
1	everything else , avoid .	1	1
1	nevertheless , i will not go there , again .	1	1
1	huge disappointment .	1	1
1	was n't memorable , exciting or impressive .	1	1
1	they just are n't nice .	1	1
1	went tonight and ordered pad thai .	1	1
1	walgreens - at least this location - has gone downhill .	1	1
1	nonetheless , i will never spend another dollar in this place .	1	1
1	food is very overpriced though .	1	1
1	we really did n't care where we sat .	1	1
1	i would not recommend anybody go .	1	1
1	it smelled badly like wet dog .	1	1
1	when it came out , it was pretty lousy .	1	1
1	they even had corn hole .	1	1
1	next time i will avoid flying through this airport !	1	1
1	the outside was filthy with trash all over .	1	1
1	charged for _num_ and only did _num_ .	1	1
1	she 's obnoxious .	1	1
1	it took _num_ hours and our pizza was cold .	1	1
1	i do n't understand the big hype over this place .	1	1
1	nearly _num_ minutes after that time , my order was still not ready .	1	1
1	so my hair is lighter on the top and darker on the bottom .	1	1
1	something does n't sound right here .	1	1
1	faux wood floor makes everything echo .	1	1
1	the nurse said nothing and just kept going .	1	1
1	the building is old and dirty .	1	1
1	ordered the shrimp and mixed vegetables , was served the shrimp and broccoli .	1	1
1	i would gladly give less than one star , alas , not possible !	1	1
1	lots of other hotel choices in the area .	1	1
1	standard italian food - nothing i could buy at the grocery store .	1	1
1	so why would you love it ?	1	1
1	i 'll continue to frequent other locations , just not this particular one .	1	1
1	not my cut of tea .	1	1
1	said hopefully we come back because service is n't usually this bad .	1	1
1	know your customers , bring back the stew .	1	1
1	blah , so much for sleeping inn at sleep inn .	1	1
1	i ordered crme brulee and my husband had their almond basket with ice cream .	1	1
1	as others have said you never know what kind of service you will get .	1	1
1	it 's clear that cleanliness is not a priority here .	1	1
1	pasta was watery and very limp .	1	1
1	she offers this friday at _num_ or 2pm .	1	1
1	every january i buy _num_ months worth of cheese for my family members .	1	1
1	get rid of the mens room bathroom attendants !	1	1
1	i did n't see the hostesses smiled once during the meal .	1	1
1	horrible food .	1	1
1	quite possibly the most miserable hotel experience of my life .	1	1
1	our order required _num_ ... so no that 's not ok .	1	1
1	the layout is terrible !	1	1
1	i was there on monday december _num_ , _num_ .	1	1
1	and meats were not cooked to request and the servers forgot the eating utensils .	1	1
1	- just iceberg lettuce and cucumber !	1	1
1	three half pours of wine for like $ _num_ .	1	1
1	in short , our experience here was awful .	1	1
1	no thanks .	1	1
1	i was very disappointed .	1	1
1	so i know it 's an off the shelf thing .	1	1
1	( _num_ minutes on hold ) ... ... ... ... ... ... still transferred .	1	1
1	i was told _num_ min .	1	1
1	the positives are that the staff were friendly and worked quickly .	1	1
1	just a mess .	1	1
1	bad service , bland food .	1	1
1	what could have been a very positive experience was absolutely ruined by this man .	1	1
1	very disappointed in the quality of what i got .	1	1
1	people are crazy about it but that thing tastes extremely ridiculous .	1	1
1	was sick to my stomach all afternoon .	1	1
1	not really .	1	1
1	seriously , how many f words can you not use on a yelp review ?	1	1
1	but for $ _num_ , and that 's all you get ?	1	1
1	the shuttle driver just sits there and does not help in anyway .	1	1
1	very small and uncomfortable .	1	1
1	_num_ ) the server was as good as you could ever ask for .	1	1
1	manager embarrassed himself .	1	1
1	the pizza , even when plain , is very greasy .	1	1
1	stayed at the hotel and booked two massages .	1	1
1	complete mush .	1	1
1	bland .	1	1
1	we were seated and then waited _num_ minutes to even be greeted .	1	1
1	outdated for the volume of traffic handled .	1	1
1	nothing i had tasted good .	1	1
1	mine did n't show up in my delivery order .	1	1
1	a simple `` sorry for the wait '' would have been nice .	1	1
1	food is ok but horrible delivery service .	1	1
1	one can understand , this is charlotte and thus not a indian food destination .	1	1
1	everytime we attempt to come here they are closed .	1	1
1	the fries were soggy and cold .	1	1
1	no one has gotten back to me yet .	1	1
1	very disappointing .	1	1
1	same practice same reason double the amount .	1	1
1	it 's cold and completely unimpressive .	1	1
1	there was not even an attempt to right the wrong .	1	1
1	it was scary pink and super soft -- like raw hamburger generally is .	1	1
1	food was just ok , nothing special .	1	1
1	i wish zero stars were an option .	1	1
1	what a completely miserable experience .	1	1
1	i told him we would like our $ _num_ back .	1	1
1	the only tasty dish was our appetizer lettuce wrap .	1	1
1	maybe part of the problem was expectations ?	1	1
1	i dunno .	1	1
1	boring .	1	1
1	will not be coming back to this place unless i 'm dragged .	1	1
1	will not go here again .	1	1
1	i am typically used to larger rolls with _num_ or _num_ pieces .	1	1
1	_num_ ) the plants this past summer were infested .	1	1
1	anyway , do n't try to eat here .	1	1
1	last saturday , i paid for my ticket and headed in .	1	1
1	the hot sauce bottles were empty and dirty .	1	1
1	overall it an ok place to go to get a few drinks .	1	1
1	the bar area has maybe half a dozen customers at the time .	1	1
1	no vegan desert option for me ( fresh fruit option , please ?	1	1
1	( this was a different , older man btw ) .	1	1
1	i would recommend that if you go there never sit and eat .	1	1
1	it is dirty and the employees are lazy and exceptionally slow .	1	1
1	rating - _num_ out of _num_ .	1	1
1	nothing special about anything , imo .	1	1
1	she was not present for about _num_ minutes after we were sat .	1	1
1	apparently , reservations are not valued here .	1	1
1	service is n't too bad , but could be better .	1	1
1	strange odor - musty old smell .	1	1
1	the manager said i can take _num_ % off of your bill !	1	1
1	chang 's on tuesday night and have to say that is was terrible .	1	1
1	it sits in the warmer cases , and looks `` crusty '' .	1	1
1	i should 've known better .	1	1
1	worst hotel i have yet to stay in as a consultant .	1	1
1	this is an email i received from what seems to be the manager .	1	1
1	filthy would be a step up from the actual conditions .	1	1
1	i stood there for a second and realized she was blatantly blowing me off .	1	1
1	we gave a written notice to the leasing manager and a doctors letter .	1	1
1	prices too high for strip district beer .	1	1
1	do not attend this college , i repeat do not attend this college .	1	1
1	this is not an exaggeration .	1	1
1	it 's not what i was looking for , but thank you '' .	1	1
1	just really lots of junk .	1	1
1	can you say awkward ?	1	1
1	so disappointed !	1	1
1	i stopped by to see them , asking them to give me a price .	1	1
1	it is not daily normal , ordinary dirt .	1	1
1	the wait staff -- not too pleasant !	1	1
1	i have n't been back here in years .	1	1
1	terrible `` hostess '' experience .	1	1
1	this place is horrible .	1	1
1	this is place is no longer what it used to be .	1	1
1	they had to be cooked prior to us ordering , or even getting there .	1	1
1	service sucked !	1	1
1	the food options are spread out , expensive , and impersonal .	1	1
1	but my room is outdated and smells like there has been a massive leak .	1	1
1	rice and the veggies i got were no problem .	1	1
1	overall , i would n't go back .	1	1
1	this seemed quite bizarre .	1	1
1	i 've never been a big drinker ; over priced beer and soda .	1	1
1	that was not the first time .	1	1
1	overcooked and cold .	1	1
1	i will not go back until they are gone .	1	1
1	also , parking is a big problem .	1	1
1	service , small selection and mediocre food .	1	1
1	i disliked the cold cheese and cold pepperoni on so so crust .	1	1
1	the food was pretty good , but service was pretty bad .	1	1
1	just do n't eat here stay away avoid at all cost !	1	1
1	avoid until this store gets its act together .	1	1
1	possibly the worst pizza i have ever eaten .	1	1
1	i was really annoyed .	1	1
1	it was ridiculous .	1	1
1	two cups of coffee per room per day , extras can be purchased .	1	1
1	i flew through here two times last week .	1	1
1	as you may have guessed , this did not happen .	1	1
1	dew & when they brought it out , it was in a can .	1	1
1	terrible .	1	1
1	jimmy wan 's offers white and brown , no extra charge .	1	1
1	do not waste money here .	1	1
1	bread , cheese , meat - that 's it .	1	1
1	worst ever at everything they do .	1	1
1	however , we were highly disappointed by the food .	1	1
1	makes me glad i live in new york city .	1	1
1	even worse is the bs sign on the register .	1	1
1	pretty rough , but not completely unbearable .	1	1
1	this is the worst mexican restaurant i have ever been to .	1	1
1	super slow , cold fries , freezer burned carrots , rubbery lobster claws .	1	1
1	pamela is a bad representation of this location !	1	1
1	the sandwich options were limited , and staff completely unhelpful .	1	1
1	for almost $ _num_ we had a very disappointing dinner .	1	1
1	poor service .	1	1

1	the hot wings i ordered came as plain breaded wings .	1	1

1	horrible food .	1	1
1	nice big restaurant , just lacking in overall experience .	1	1
1	terrible treatment .	1	1
1	big mistake coming here .	1	1

1	i attempted to order an ultimate steakhouse martini with kettle one .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	totally gross !	1	1
1	i feel like i 'm in the 80s at this movie theater .	1	1
1	it also reeks of a unpleasant scent .	1	1
1	terrible service .	1	1
1	the tv reception is absolutely horrible .	1	1
1	since we were staying one night , this was a major disappointment .	1	1
1	went to getaway last night for famous fajitas .	1	1
1	i get through security and notice the tight space of this terminal .	1	1
1	that is not cool .	1	1
1	the old woman was not nice .	1	1
1	ok italian food , portions are big , but you pay for them .	1	1
1	then they do n't show up until _num_ hours later !	1	1
1	i am sure i will not be returning .	1	1
1	my house made chips were good & cole slaw had very little flavor .	1	1
1	never going back , letting our bank handle this one .	1	1
1	i asked for a mount and balance from them and had a good laugh .	1	1
1	the restaurant had several empty tables .	1	1

1	it was also very dry .	1	1
1	horrible customer service !	1	1
1	i was very uncomfortable .	1	1
1	the manager did n't seem to care at all about our situation .	1	1
1	not even good for an eight dollar lunch special .	1	1
1	took my puppy there for the first time this week .	1	1
1	terrible food , service always rushed .	1	1
1	no , i just got home .	1	1
1	this is n't the first time either .	1	1
1	very disappointing .	1	1
1	on top of that , there was no broccoli .	1	1
1	and if it is , it is the worst nightclub airport in the world .	1	1
1	and the garlic wings did n't taste like garlic .	1	1
1	the last _num_ times i 've eaten here the prime rib was still cold .	1	1
1	so no inspection upon return , guys ?	1	1
1	prime rib sub that was a mass of gristle and fat .	1	1
1	they do everything they can to charge you extra fees .	1	1
1	the front desk girls were not friendly or helpful as well .	1	1
1	it was like a fast food chicken with that really dried out taste .	1	1
1	it 's just generic stuff .	1	1
1	i did not like my experience , and i wo n't go back .	1	1
1	will not go there again !	1	1
1	and then just stood there waiting to write my order down .	1	1
1	i ordered here after the many good reviews but was quite disappointed .	1	1
1	the hotel manager is a joke and very rude .	1	1
1	that exchange was awkward too .	1	1
1	if you have any common sense at all , please do n't stay here .	1	1
1	one quote $ _num_ , another quote was $ _num_ .	1	1
1	made many promises and failed to keep them .	1	1
1	the sushi was mediocre at best .	1	1
1	in the end , would not recommend the taco bell .	1	1
1	they sit on the tables and often just sit at your table .	1	1
1	they are soggy and tasteless , maybe the worst i 've ever had .	1	1
1	so we make our decisions .	1	1
1	my boyfriend ordered shrimp and grits .	1	1
1	this continued for the total of _num_ hours .	1	1
1	( did i mention they tasted like old fryer grease ? )	1	1
1	then i was confused .	1	1
1	brick oven pizza cold ... .	1	1
1	so why do they get _num_ stars instead of just _num_ ?	1	1
1	my cookie had no fortune .	1	1
1	i am extremely disappointed with the way things went at our event !	1	1
1	the actual equipment is ok , but the locker rooms are pretty bad .	1	1
1	random pizza toppings on lettuce ) this time around .	1	1
1	i dropped off _num_ shirts at this establishment just before thanksgiving .	1	1
1	in fact , the building where they once occupied has been torn down .	1	1
1	i 've been here three times and it 's been inconsistent .	1	1
1	still no food .	1	1
1	this was by far the worst hotel i 've ever stayed in .	1	1
1	i would never rent here again .	1	1
1	pho broth takes like nine hours to make .	1	1
1	no sodas .	1	1
1	i then recieved the bill the next month and the price had no change .	1	1
1	diners beware , spend your money elsewhere .	1	1
1	mediocre and poorly made !	1	1
1	it does n't even have to be memorable ... just not offensive .	1	1
1	is n't that what they 're supposed to do ?	1	1
1	i am not so sure where that nasty bug ended up .	1	1
1	the sausage was disgusting , and not spicy at all .	1	1
1	my biggest complaint is the drink prices .	1	1
1	i should have just gone to giant eagle .	1	1
1	normally , i have had the best experiences there .	1	1
1	there are n't many places to eat here .	1	1
1	what a disappointment - i wo n't be back .	1	1
1	he ordered a pork dish and i had lobster ravioli .	1	1
1	all they want is your money !	1	1
1	i do n't like this place at all .	1	1
1	she does n't even look at me , let alone speak to me .	1	1
1	however , seconds never came .	1	1
1	look out for charges for options you did n't actually get .	1	1
1	horrendous service and mediocre food .	1	1
1	i 'm looking for a better pool side lounge for this summer .	1	1
1	oh no , same lady still at the register .	1	1
1	sunny only offered a free cleaning and even then seemed annoyed .	1	1
1	it is very disappointing after having wonderful experiences here for over _num_ decades !	1	1
1	the beer garden was out of the most popular styles .	1	1
1	i 'm not watching my weight -- i can handle it .	1	1
1	the salon itself also disappointed me .	1	1
1	the food is crap .	1	1
1	it was just terrible .	1	1
1	it did n't look appetizing , nor did it actually taste appetizing .	1	1
1	shes says , `` they 're not '' .	1	1
1	terrible place and i would not recommend this facility to anyone .	1	1
1	this is not only a bad business practice but it is illegal and fraud .	1	1
1	and a side salad at almost $ _num_ .	1	1
1	why take down my room number if you were n't going to call me ?	1	1
1	even after constant complaints , this company has continued to deliver sub-par service .	1	1
1	replied `` uh , it has to be printed '' .	1	1
1	my jacket took a few days to air out the smell of the smoke .	1	1
1	great shrimp cocktail but i wish i had my fish sandwich across the street .	1	1
1	i 'm allergic to smoke .	1	1
1	waited _num_ minutes for drinks , _num_ minutes for good .	1	1
1	this is probably the worst business in carnegie .	1	1
1	my main course was n't much better .	1	1
1	same price by the airport and your in a luxury .	1	1
1	i did n't think it was going to be as bad as i experienced .	1	1
1	had to track down another server twice for drink refills and our check .	1	1
1	the hostess was incredibly rude directly off of the bat .	1	1
1	i was greatly disappointed by this restaurant .	1	1
1	do n't expect great performances here , expect a talked up mediocre performance .	1	1
1	so it 's mother 's day and we did not have a reservation .	1	1
1	even the orange juice was bad .	1	1
1	unbelievable .	1	1
1	i 'm not a big foodie but i like my food taste better .	1	1
1	_num_ minutes later , they appeared .	1	1
1	terrible job !	1	1
1	so incompetent i did not even get a chance to rate the actual service .	1	1
1	got through the rentals with no problem .	1	1
1	another _num_ minutes pass and we finally got our order .	1	1
1	gag !	1	1
1	the most disappointing part is the sushi itself .	1	1
1	i really like the pizza and marinated vegetables .	1	1
1	very common problem in these apartments .	1	1
1	i was very specific when i made my reservations several months ago .	1	1

1	_num_ minutes later he calls again and asks where we are .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	our group mostly ordered the prime rib and two had the blackened chicken pasta .	1	1
1	probably not .	1	1
1	very poor service and food .	1	1
1	the three pastas were very , very basic .	1	1
1	it 's _num_ or _num_ bucks now after _num_ .	1	1
1	soooo disappointing !	1	1
1	i met my friend jean here , she is a once a week customer .	1	1
1	i imagined smashed potatoes to be a bit more mashed .	1	1
1	this place is disgusting !	1	1
1	the service was awful .	1	1
1	they ca n't seem to tell me anything .	1	1
1	also $ _num_ beers of which i 've had about _num_ .	1	1

1	oh but it 's not .	1	1
1	pot stickers - both steamed and fried - which were pretty good .	1	1
1	only takes cash or check !	1	1
1	there is always something missing from the drive thru order .	1	1
1	as an added bonus , the ethnic section is a joke .	1	1
1	i know some people have off days but this was bad .	1	1
1	i was immediately disgusted .	1	1
1	otherwise , negative stars would be in effect .	1	1
1	they charge me for their mistake .	1	1
1	i also had a few bites of the chicken marsala .	1	1
1	it 's the customers fault your staff ca n't handle a sat night rush .	1	1
1	it has been _num_ .	1	1
1	highly recommend not buying a suit here .	1	1
1	ugh ... way overpriced , same taste as the food court at the mall .	1	1
1	nothing tasted bad but it was way too expensive .	1	1
1	these people are unbelievable !	1	1
1	the manager on duty never stopped by or said anything .	1	1
1	he obviously did n't care at all .	1	1
1	we paid for drinks and left our sever a gracious tip .	1	1
1	the same plain pizza we order never seems to taste the same .	1	1
1	i was wrong .	1	1
1	the shrimp were $ _num_ a piece .	1	1
1	the buffalo pierogies however , was a total miss .	1	1
1	i found a property online that i fell in love with .	1	1

1	found food and trash in the refrigerator .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	there was no bam !	1	1
1	please do not let the star rating for this groomer fool you .	1	1
1	cheap food , but everything fried on a friday tastes like fish .	1	1
1	it pains me to write this review .	1	1
1	the inside is very dated and appears to be poorly cared for .	1	1
1	rice is reheated .	1	1
1	all in all , it was def not my best groupon date night .	1	1
1	the coleslaw lacked flavor and the bun was simple white bread .	1	1
1	i ca n't even understand how people came to that conclusion .	1	1
1	the service is incredibly slow .	1	1
1	at tram 's , the pho bowl is small .	1	1
1	to be honest , that sealed the deal for me .	1	1
1	some of the worst pizza i 've ever had .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	food was mediocre .	1	1
1	their food is terrible if you ever get it .	1	1
1	quick cheap food with a tolerable customer service .	1	1
1	unfortunately , we threw out most of our entrees .	1	1
1	my lettuce was drowning in the vinegar .	1	1
1	so over price that i can not afford a drink .	1	1
1	unfortunately , it is yet another example of poorly made americanized italian food .	1	1
1	this was some of the worst food i 've ever had .	1	1
1	so , i had been wanting to try this place for some time .	1	1
1	a true waste of money .	1	1
1	fried rice was ... just not what i expected , not exceptional either .	1	1
1	rip off apartment complex .	1	1

1	atmosphere was bad .	1	1
1	the place smells awful and the workers are grumpy .	1	1
1	i would give this place a _num_ star if i could !	1	1

1	then , it was an even longer wait to order dinner .	1	1
1	terrible selection , rude !	1	1
1	total dive bar with awful food and service .	1	1
1	the cherry special chicken , however , was pretty darn tasty .	1	1
1	they were overpriced , and not worth it .	1	1
1	the crepe pancakes were ok , but nothing to write home about .	1	1
1	i could n't have tried to make food this poor .	1	1
1	steak was over cooked .	1	1
1	no body ever called me .	1	1
1	there was a little bit of a wait which is expected on saturday night .	1	1

1	very hit or miss place .	1	1
1	i have no one to blame but myself .	1	1
1	after _num_ more min .	1	1
1	this is the worst hibachi i have ever had .	1	1
1	so disappointed .	1	1
1	salads , sandwiches , burgers and entrees we have all had before .	1	1
1	there is nothing chinese about the food !	1	1
1	personally , i was n't having an orgasm over my mediocre pizza .	1	1
1	awful acoustics !	1	1
1	but it was downhill from there .	1	1
1	honestly , it looked like someone had already starting eating this .	1	1
1	another waste of time , wait until people my age get old .	1	1
1	they really need a customer service training .	1	1
1	cash only is not an acceptable policy in _num_ .	1	1
1	this place sucks .	1	1
1	totally disgusting .	1	1
1	i 've been here about _num_ other times through the year .	1	1
1	will not go eat there again !	1	1
1	and all they do is apologize but ca n't solve any problems .	1	1
1	what a complete waste of time .	1	1
1	you can not pay me money to eat here again .	1	1
1	this time i got the grilled chicken salad .	1	1
1	they got two orders wrong in our party of _num_ though .	1	1
1	horrible , horrible company .	1	1
1	oh my gosh both of our dishes were horrible .	1	1
1	nothing fancy -- short on the sides and back , an inch on top .	1	1
1	long story short - she took the dress in ... significantly ... by mistake .	1	1
1	i would not recommend this place and would never go back .	1	1
1	Neutral	1	1
1	worst delivery service .	1	1
1	the oven was way too hot for this type of pizza .	1	1
1	nancy was very unprofessional and rude .	1	1
1	the two dancers i did see where not all that great looking .	1	1
1	too many decent pizza places in charlotte to settle for this place .	1	1
1	went back yesterday after passing over for several years .	1	1
1	i 'm sure it would have been great !	1	1
1	the gym facilities are atrocious .	1	1
1	it looks like the floors and base boards have not cleaning in months .	1	1
1	but the overall vibe is weird and the service sucks .	1	1
1	the decor was outdated and looked drab .	1	1
1	i believe he is a sushi chef and certainly lacks management skills .	1	1
1	before she ran off , we ordered our meals .	1	1
1	they complained that our house was not clean and scared off the potential tenants .	1	1
1	seafood noodle soup had slices of pork .	1	1
1	it 's not even summer yet .	1	1
1	only _num_ people in line when arrived .	1	1
1	we all know it 's not great .	1	1
1	even the shoes fell apart after a few months .	1	1
1	there are no descriptions for any of the rolls .	1	1
1	there is no security cameras in the parking lot .	1	1
1	but i would not go there for breakfast .	1	1
1	there were no parked cars visible from the road ; and _num_ ) .	1	1
1	wrong pizza was delivered .	1	1
1	they confirmed my reservation on the phone .	1	1
1	you should be embarrassed and ashamed to even be selling these !	1	1
1	this is the first , and probably only , negative review i have posted .	1	1
1	my sandwich did n't even have true tomato slices .	1	1
1	they charged $ _num_ because i was buying the ticket for someone else .	1	1
1	well ok i guess .	1	1
1	although it says it 's non-smoking , my room reeked of cigarette smoke !	1	1
1	as for the food , it was bland , not much flavor .	1	1
1	are you kidding me ?	1	1
1	they are super thin and crispy on the outside .	1	1
1	in summary , i would expect so much more from a hilton property .	1	1
1	we were like , whoa , where the heck did that come from .	1	1
1	i really think our waitress forgot to put our order in .	1	1
1	only redeeming thing was bojangles .	1	1
1	my kids would not even eat them .	1	1
1	it lacks the true flavor that pho broth should have .	1	1
1	my trim & partial high lights took _num_ 1/2 hours though !	1	1
1	completely ridiculous .	1	1
1	do n't waste your time .	1	1
1	did not get the thanksgiving day paper that i paid extra for either .	1	1
1	food was _num_ out of _num_ for this type of bar / restaurant .	1	1
1	she did n't seem to care at all either .	1	1
1	the food was old and somewhat cold .	1	1
1	i 'm sorry , but you get one star for that .	1	1
1	we all ordered different things and none of us could eat our meals .	1	1
1	i would never come back .	1	1
1	but the food came cold .	1	1
1	they all looked at me , none greeted or walked toward me .	1	1
1	is that too much to ask ?	1	1
1	often see people sitting on the floor at some gates .	1	1
1	i ordered a western omelette that was just completely destroyed by imitation cheese .	1	1
1	corn bread was like cardboard .	1	1
1	i would n't order a pizza from them again .	1	1
1	her ex must have ran , not walked away from her .	1	1
1	i booked _num_ style appointments in advance for a wedding .	1	1
1	epic fail bk , clean up your act .	1	1
1	the pork fried rice was actually pork burnt rice , nasty ( _num_ ) .	1	1
1	no ... .	1	1
1	they were full except one table that the guests behind me quickly claimed .	1	1
1	it 's not worth the headache .	1	1
1	i ate one slice , and gave the rest away .	1	1
1	our waiter was not very attentive .	1	1
1	owner or manager was very rude when we presented our yelp deal .	1	1
1	it smells like an elderly persons home .	1	1
1	no refund given .	1	1
1	salmon salad was not good at all .	1	1
1	it 's not .	1	1
1	we ordered the szechuan shrimp and scallops and also the shrimp in garlic sauce .	1	1
1	there are also not many place to eat around the hotel .	1	1
1	customer service was a joke .	1	1
1	he is not !	1	1
1	it was that bad .	1	1
1	had two very disappointing dinners here .	1	1
1	i did n't touch anyone .	1	1
1	so , that gets a low mark in my book .	1	1
1	for a place that seems so classy , the experience surely was not .	1	1
1	all i got was a smoking room .	1	1
1	it is way too expensive .	1	1
1	days passed and no call .	1	1
1	do n't even waste your time with this restaurant .	1	1
1	the food and the drink i ordered were so mediocre it 's ridiculous .	1	1
1	eggplant was okay but lacked adequate quantities of shrimp .	1	1
1	was with friends for a birthday and it was _num_ degrees outside that night .	1	1
1	no drafts or specials on a friday when we got there at _num_ .	1	1
1	would i have had to call in to sort out their staff 's mistake ?	1	1
1	food ok but service ... ... horrible !	1	1
1	this hotel is a complete ripoff !	1	1
1	that 's not a life i 'm comfortable with .	1	1
1	if this is their generic price for _num_ hour of labor it is ridiculous .	1	1
1	how do you mess up beef fried rice ?	1	1
1	they could n't find it in the `` on holds area '' wth ?	1	1
1	she said she would n't know til _num_ .	1	1
1	all hype .	1	1
1	very busy with short wait times .	1	1
1	very slow .	1	1
1	this had not been discussed at the time of booking a few hours earlier .	1	1
1	i can hear every ... single ... conversation that goes on in the hallway .	1	1
1	it was my last time , i will ever stop again .	1	1
1	the waiter comp my meal out .	1	1
1	the owner ( larger woman ) is rude and dismissive of my questions .	1	1
1	it is a little overpriced even with coupons for the quality of food .	1	1
1	this is the worst pizza store in charlotte .	1	1
1	no this was just gross .	1	1
1	staff was friendly and drinks were reasonable but nothing to rave about .	1	1
1	very rude staff .	1	1
1	the food was bland at best .	1	1
1	you should sue the pants off the entertainment district for the late night noise .	1	1
1	she refused , and again tried to place the blame on me .	1	1
1	no one bothered to tell us that the pool was out of commission .	1	1
1	you could n't see the table there was so much food .	1	1
1	i am glad our meeting is changing either way i will not be returning .	1	1
1	never have i heard of this being done elsewhere .	1	1
1	would not recommend this company to anyone .	1	1
1	stuffed mushrooms , but my seafood pasta just came up bland and too oily .	1	1
1	the last few times out experience was just fair .	1	1
1	it 's og though , so neither were anything spectacular .	1	1
1	the pasta dish would have been very good had it been seasoned enough .	1	1
1	i do not get it .	1	1
1	he did nothing to compensate us for the long wait .	1	1
1	i do not recommend this place .	1	1
1	the food was very poor .	1	1
1	i can not eat this .	1	1
1	this has only been my 2nd time at a red lobster ever .	1	1
1	besides , one can google any recipe online for free .	1	1
1	why post a closing time if it is n't honored ?	1	1
1	the underwhelming : the french onion soup was not hot .	1	1
1	it seems as if this place is now more hit or miss .	1	1
1	i do n't see this at any other airports .	1	1
1	i gave it three visits before passing judgement .	1	1
1	we still stayed because i insisted on applebee 's .	1	1
1	holly on the way to _num_ .	1	1
1	they are taken over by a very large mega restaurant chain corporation .	1	1
1	the music the guys played was all stuff from like _num_ .	1	1
1	it was just so gross id rather have just ordered pizza .	1	1
1	not that the food was bad , mind you .	1	1
1	problem is , there wo n't be a next time .	1	1
1	well what a mistake i made .	1	1
1	`` again i ask oh really is there nothing you can do ? ''	1	1
1	just very greasy , very salty , poor excuse for chinese takeout .	1	1
1	the next week starts , still no call .	1	1
1	we 've been there several times and each time we left disappointed .	1	1
1	the haircut was $ _num_ .	1	1
1	sorry but you guys deserve a _num_ .	1	1
1	will not be going back ever .	1	1
1	terrible .	1	1
1	if you are lucky turn down service will happen .	1	1
1	this place has an overall _num_ star review for a reason .	1	1
1	just not going back there .	1	1
1	the food is terrible ... .	1	1
1	it was awkward .	1	1
1	there is a bitter taste in my mouth about lotus grocery .	1	1
1	we use to like this facility very much .	1	1
1	crystal clear and the music sounded like a million bucks coming out of it .	1	1
1	this used to be one of my favorite thrift stores .	1	1
1	it 's to bad this attitude does n't extend to the kitchen .	1	1
1	the waitress says she sorry and puts a quick order in right away .	1	1
1	the last time i was here i was rushing between flights .	1	1
1	in the meantime your connecting flight can be boarding .	1	1
1	not us .	1	1
1	great location but low on amenities .	1	1
1	port authority sucks !	1	1
1	my acrylic nails are crooked and shorter than i asked .	1	1
1	this shell station is horrible .	1	1
1	wow , were has customer service gone ?	1	1
1	we left , went to the charlotte store and they were amazing .	1	1
1	the rice was bland and slightly overcooked .	1	1
1	the food is nothing worth writing home about .	1	1
1	the beer is awesome i will admit and the servers are pretty attentive .	1	1
1	i must admit , i do like the brews .	1	1
1	it looked like microwaved pizza and it tasted terrible , cardboard like .	1	1
1	despite the cost of the set we had to pay $ _num_ for delivery .	1	1
1	it was n't very hot either .	1	1
1	thats not really a big deal .	1	1
1	_num_ out of _num_ is not great .	1	1
1	i can not even with that .	1	1
1	my wife got mama 's trio .	1	1
1	it came with this layer of oil , and not enough `` sauce '' .	1	1
1	fried dumplings were thick and mushy .	1	1
1	when the salad arrived , it did not look like the picture .	1	1
1	i have a idea , get rid of those cashiers , fire them !	1	1
1	at this point we had n't complained .	1	1
1	my daughter and i ordered my pizza slices to eat in and hers togo .	1	1
1	i will not be back .	1	1
1	well , that coffee i spent $ _num_ on ?	1	1
1	day comes and they miss the _num_ hour delivery window .	1	1
1	on the whole , a major disappointment .	1	1
1	seems like they used imitation cheese , because it certainly didnt melt .	1	1
1	well , it does get one from point a to point b in pittsburgh .	1	1
1	maybe i 'm weird .	1	1
1	walmart does n't even make you do that !	1	1
1	it was not , it was also almost three hours long as well .	1	1
1	what is worse is the food is bland .	1	1
1	i paid over $ _num_ for _num_ large cheese pizzas .	1	1
1	i do n't want to be too mean .	1	1
1	not good .	1	1
1	not a bad place to look around while waiting for your order .	1	1
1	wo n't be back .	1	1
1	the people all look like they hate their jobs and treat the customers accordingly .	1	1
1	why would they say _num_ mins lose refund .	1	1
1	i 'm done i throw in the towel trying to deal with them .	1	1
1	my mother had the same experience with the same _num_ companies .	1	1
1	not a lot of fat on them .	1	1
1	oh , and as for that `` cheap '' bit .	1	1
1	so , i settled on the hummus appetizer .	1	1
1	a long wait and not being greeted at the door for about _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	it is such a rip off .	1	1
1	drink price : $ _num_ for a beer .	1	1
1	we also got a chicken ranch flat bread and this left us disappointed .	1	1
1	do not waste your money at this restaurant .	1	1
1	dont waste your time with this place .	1	1
1	she simply said that sometimes they are n't told when someone is seated outside .	1	1
1	but now i 'm weary of the restaurant all together .	1	1
1	i told him that i would rather donate the items to a theater .	1	1
1	we got into our room , gross and nasty .	1	1
1	but i am not rushing back .	1	1
1	chicken was way over cooked .	1	1
1	horrible business practice here .	1	1
1	essentially , the entire sandwich was inedible and i settled for five guys instead .	1	1
1	then i drove back and went inside and i talked to the manager .	1	1
1	food is mediocre at best !	1	1
1	they already had my money , so why be courteous now ?	1	1
1	the beer was good , service was ok , but the food was terrible .	1	1
1	at 1pm , with lots of open tables , they could n't seat me .	1	1
1	thumbs down .	1	1
1	this was ridiculous to us so we left !	1	1
1	would recommend not sitting outside or at the bar if you want food .	1	1
1	richard does not make you feel comfortable .	1	1
1	the haircut was mediocre , but the highlights were much worse .	1	1
1	she did n't really care for any of it .	1	1
1	if you are going to order something , i would go with the pizza .	1	1
1	this is the worst restaurant i have ever not eaten at in charlotte !	1	1
1	thus station needs more amenities and a makeover to compete with the dc one !	1	1
1	to boot , the beer was pretty expensive .	1	1
1	what i have a problem with is all the nasty flies in the building .	1	1
1	came out fast , but entre 's came out _num_ mins later .	1	1
1	was the fourth car in line and have been sitting here for _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	my potato came out very soggy , the steak very much over cooked .	1	1
1	so , that was really disappointing .	1	1
1	service was okay not the greatest but not the worst either .	1	1
1	it went on for about _num_ minutes and really made my stop there interesting .	1	1
1	i think people should know how awful this place is before stepping inside .	1	1
1	last nights visit to buca was less than i expect from this restaurant .	1	1
1	service was extremely slow .	1	1
1	no fuss .	1	1
1	it was kind of shady business practice so i wo n't go back .	1	1
1	literally worst service i 've ever received at a hotel .	1	1
1	e. no apology or compensation .	1	1
1	we took one sip and realized it was bad .	1	1
1	way overpriced and service was n't great .	1	1
1	absurd .	1	1
1	huge fail for this type of venue .	1	1
1	sea bass was steamed spinach coated in soy sauce .	1	1
1	i use to the this place but the management is horrible .	1	1
1	i immediately wanted to send it back but the waitress was gone again mia .	1	1
1	rather , they were extremely rude and defensive .	1	1
1	i could n't get the taste of char out of my mouth .	1	1
1	unfortunately the food did not come close to my expectations .	1	1
1	she finally got the receipt and gave me $ _num_ cash back .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	unfortunate .	1	1
1	terrible will never go back .	1	1
1	oh yeah , the ac sounds like a _num_ taking off above your bed .	1	1
1	upstairs looks like it 's a club at night .	1	1
1	you do not know the specific circumstances surrounding my situation .	1	1
1	i 've got to ask myself why do i keep doing this .	1	1
1	smh worst service every ... .	1	1
1	the hot tub does n't work .	1	1
1	do not stay here .	1	1
1	needless to say , we walked out .	1	1
1	bad for an adult who is looking for something tasty .	1	1
1	so much for being a loyal customer .	1	1
1	pizza is pretty bland and there is nothing remarkable about it .	1	1
1	do n't waste your time !	1	1
1	worst airport ever .	1	1
1	rude .	1	1
1	not really .	1	1
1	the burger was pretty good but , i 've had much better .	1	1
1	and the last were absolutely awful .	1	1
1	they need to get this fix quickly .	1	1
1	figured they could n't mess up creme brle ... .	1	1
1	terrible service , waiter was extremely rude .	1	1
1	quality is poor .	1	1
1	i usually get the steak salad which used to be good .	1	1
1	okay bagels though a little overpriced .	1	1
1	the past three times have been very disappointing !	1	1
1	the food 's presentation was awful .	1	1
1	needless to say i got no rest .	1	1
1	when it came , it was mushy and had the consistency of baby food .	1	1
1	i bought pastries at this place several times before .	1	1
1	nothing to rave about .	1	1
1	the chicken parm sub i ordered was a hot bland mess .	1	1
1	this is the worst location .	1	1
1	i have never , ever witnessed anything so insane as a drive-through restroom .	1	1
1	the egg roll wasnt even cooked and the cabbage was awful .	1	1
1	i did n't get a damn tomato .	1	1
1	and , a table of _num_ leaving and all paying separately .	1	1
1	i will never rent form this hertz again .	1	1
1	i ordered a bacon pizza and breaded mushrooms .	1	1
1	worst service i 've had in a long time .	1	1
1	got my money back and left .	1	1
1	just ok food and service is not the greatest .	1	1
1	careless workmanship is all you 'll find here .	1	1
1	eventually after another _num_ minutes we get menus .	1	1
1	not anymore .	1	1
1	i would not recommend this item if same is prepared again .	1	1
1	not a terrible experience but not an amazing one .	1	1
1	place sucks .	1	1
1	_num_ - the locker rooms are old and sort of creepy .	1	1
1	the store is extremely pricey and nothing really interested us .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	it just wasnt enough food for the price .	1	1
1	store is too small and always crowded .	1	1
1	the only people getting help in there tonight were two other guys .	1	1
1	watery sauce , no heat .	1	1
1	bottom line : i will not be going back .	1	1
1	i am not saying that people who like this place are any particular sort .	1	1
1	everything was not in my order on delivery .	1	1
1	the sushi guy has major attitude .	1	1
1	the filet was decent but not $ _num_ worth of decent .	1	1
1	so clearly lil off there ... other then that we order common breakfast .	1	1
1	it was so bad .	1	1
1	i will not be bringing it back any time soon .	1	1
1	took over an hour , cost $ _num_ , broke my air filter .	1	1
1	the chips ... kinda bad .	1	1
1	why bother to pay for a premium products if they are n't properly prepared .	1	1
1	they are extremely slow .	1	1
1	the patty was sorta flavorful .	1	1
1	we were disappointed .	1	1
1	nothing stood out , including the famous burnt almond torte .	1	1
1	thankfully , the bk employee continued to give me my cup of coffee .	1	1
1	not planning to come back and recommend everyone to stay away from this place .	1	1
1	every order is wrong .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	we did n't move for an hour and a half .	1	1
1	i would def look elsewhere before i booked here .	1	1
1	and all of that was on a night where the place was mostly empty !	1	1
1	they do n't keep fresh food out like they should for the drivers .	1	1
1	so many great bakeries in pittsburgh so i would not go back .	1	1
1	i usually do n't ask for a receipt unless i donate electronics and such .	1	1
1	their staff is dishonest and unprofessional .	1	1
1	terrible service .	1	1
1	on the bed , there are a couple of dead roaches .	1	1
1	i really do n't know how this place got any good reviews .	1	1
1	my lil heart fell .	1	1
1	but not a good group night .	1	1
1	never going back .	1	1
1	to add insult to injury , the only restaurant in the hotel sucks .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	did n't much like the steak , and the fries were terrible .	1	1
1	avoid !	1	1
1	now ever time i get in i smell cigarettes .	1	1
1	it was like an old sweet an sour sauce with a little spice .	1	1
1	it is still in plastic and there are no burn marks .	1	1
1	everybody told me i had to try and their pancakes .	1	1
1	you get off the elevator on the 5th floor .	1	1
1	i do n't know where all the positive reviews are coming from .	1	1
1	you have no idea how badly i want to like this place .	1	1
1	will not go back .	1	1
1	anyway , i ordered the wild mushroom pasta with chicken .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	anyway , i 'm never going back here .	1	1
1	i ordered a combo they made a mistake and gave me the wrong sandwich .	1	1
1	was someone else supposed to bring it , did she forget ?	1	1
1	i gave it one star because of the waiter .	1	1
1	the food quality does n't match the place at all .	1	1
1	i get there , look at their giant selection and get excited .	1	1
1	not to mention the surprise that they do n't take credit cards .	1	1
1	)	1	1
1	my return is questionable .	1	1
1	this is not very good asian food .	1	1
1	stayed october _num_	1	1
1	i drove past this place on almost a daily basis for a couple years .	1	1
1	will never return , even if my hair does grow back .	1	1
1	upon arriving i immediately did n't feel welcome .	1	1
1	all in all , i 've found better things to spend $ _num_ on .	1	1
1	but i quickly learned my lesson .	1	1
1	every time i 've been here its been worse than the last time .	1	1
1	i follow drive diner dives he raved about this place .	1	1
1	i 've been here several times and the food is very sub-par .	1	1
1	we waited _num_ minutes for one sub and it ended up being pretty bad .	1	1
1	it does n't say cash only anywhere inside or on the menu either .	1	1
1	the mall that is nearby is not really a mall .	1	1
1	very disappointed !	1	1
1	when it was time to get up the breakfast food was bad .	1	1
1	my wife and i did n't have the best of labor day week ends .	1	1
1	i 'll stay elsewhere next time i 'm in town .	1	1
1	if i could give this place zero stars i would .	1	1
1	our visit on may _num_ was less than stellar .	1	1
1	i have only been 2x 's within a year and was a little disappointed .	1	1
1	i do n't recommend at all .	1	1
1	so yeah , no . ''	1	1
1	he also suggested me to go to er if not getting better .	1	1
1	if you want a great steakhouse , go to ruth 's chris .	1	1
1	it was pretty average italian food , nothing to write home about .	1	1
1	fianc ordered bison burger and ended up getting a 2am with egg , etc .	1	1
1	do n't waste your money !	1	1
1	service here has gone considerably downhill .	1	1
1	_num_ years i had this deal going on .	1	1
1	i would n't eat this pizza if it was free .	1	1
1	no need to be nasty .	1	1
1	he could n't save the day , though .	1	1
1	worst steakhouse experience i have had to date !	1	1
1	they called on the wrong number despite we have given the right one .	1	1
1	having limited options in uptown i gave this place a few chances .	1	1
1	i just felt like i was being questioned .	1	1
1	if i could give negative stars i would .	1	1
1	and then there was another lady that was complaining about their service too .	1	1
1	unfortunately , it failed in less than one year .	1	1
1	it 's the only place i order my chinese takeout from .	1	1
1	this may be the worst mcdonalds in charlotte .	1	1
1	i was _num_ minutes late , no need to yell .	1	1
1	i know i should have called beforehand .	1	1
1	nothing was done to accommodate the crappy situation unfortunately .	1	1
1	and the seats are certainly not designed for sleeping .	1	1
1	answer : pretty bad !	1	1
1	what a shame !	1	1
1	he called me to pick him up as i was paying the bill .	1	1
1	i had no disclosure of this whatsoever when i signed my lease .	1	1
1	i ordered the teriyaki steak and it had zero teriyaki flavor .	1	1
1	to get a cab walk to the westin across the street .	1	1
1	we will not visit this location again .	1	1
1	would not recommend .	1	1
1	however , the food is definitely meh .	1	1
1	maybe i just got an old cake , i do n't know .	1	1
1	the worst part is , i got sick for _num_ days after .	1	1
1	the bread was stale , and after waiting _num_ minutes i was definitely disappointed .	1	1
1	_num_ years of loyalty mean nothing if you are laid off .	1	1
1	while the onion soup was actually good , the rest was awful .	1	1
1	had to sign up just to inform others not to waste their money .	1	1
1	the portions are large and the prices are very inexpensive .	1	1
1	overall , i would never dine here again .	1	1
1	not a degree above room temp .	1	1
1	unfortunate because i would have enjoyed trying it !	1	1
1	i was very disappointed with food here .	1	1
1	for a fri night , the service was slow .	1	1
1	i wo n't be wasting my money again .	1	1
1	they know they 're going to get customers in regardless .	1	1
1	bacon does n't take that long to cook .	1	1
1	avoid this place at all costs !	1	1
1	horrible atmosphere for the food on the menu in parts .	1	1
1	several times they 've screwed my order up , often leaving ingredients off completely .	1	1
1	not a good value in my book .	1	1
1	no salad .	1	1
1	_num_ . )	1	1
1	diner _num_ - ordered the salad with the lobster roll , hold the bread .	1	1
1	this has happened the last _num_ out of _num_ times i visited this location .	1	1
1	i took my mom out for her birthday and we left disappointed .	1	1
1	worst experience .	1	1
1	this `` pizza '' was the worst food i have ever eaten .	1	1
1	ridiculously overpriced for the finished product and experience .	1	1
1	worst of all the food sucked .	1	1
1	the quality of the food has gone way downhill as has the service .	1	1
1	_num_ march 1st this is the date i went .	1	1
1	very very slow service and no authenticity in the meals .	1	1
1	find another place where the doctors care .	1	1
1	the huge problem is the teppanyaki ... just awful .	1	1
1	i was definitely not wowed by the sushi here .	1	1
1	a little goodwill would have cost them nothing .	1	1
1	and the beef with broccoli was worse !	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	now , my street tacos on the other hand is a completely different story .	1	1
1	this was by far the worst `` pizza '' i 've ever had .	1	1
1	it takes forever to get the problem fixed and a new car .	1	1
1	it was good but nothing to rave about .	1	1
1	what great wall of china south serves is cheap , frozen egg rolls .	1	1
1	they do n't c are .	1	1
1	we paid and left , completely unsatisfied with the meal .	1	1
1	this was my second visit and alas , my last .	1	1
1	he seemed to be in a bad mood and made us feel uncomfortable .	1	1
1	but for a few seconds , water completely stops .	1	1
1	_num_ . )	1	1
1	reservation for _num_ on a saturday made with ease .	1	1
1	i am not sure if i will go back which is really a shame .	1	1
1	this leaves the meat dry and tasteless .	1	1
1	total failure .	1	1
1	i stopped in during lunch and ordered a steak burrito with guacamole to go .	1	1
1	they came quickly - only three days from when we reported the problem .	1	1
1	the noodles were overcooked and mushy .	1	1
1	poor service , crappy food .	1	1
1	unfortunately the reality did n't match the idea of the burger .	1	1
1	not very professional .	1	1
1	we also waited over _num_ minutes before someone even took our order .	1	1
1	the parking situation is horrible .	1	1
1	when it was brought back , there was a small hair in it .	1	1
1	even with the munchies at 2am this place is bad .	1	1
1	the service here sucks .	1	1
1	really bad italian food .	1	1
1	_num_ person simply sat our mimosas on the table and did n't speak .	1	1
1	therefore , that left junior stylists to wash and dry my hair .	1	1
1	bread is awful .	1	1
1	it was also virtually tasteless .	1	1
1	poor customer service .	1	1
1	in all honesty i would 've rather had five guys or in-n-out burgers .	1	1
1	i would strongly advise anyone seeking a quality landscaping contractor to look elsewhere .	1	1
1	maybe it 's just the built in crowd .	1	1
1	but it was n't over .	1	1
1	ate here once with a buy one , get one coupon .	1	1
1	Negative	1	1
1	the olives were even disgusting -- how do you mess up olives ?	1	1
1	it 's supposed to have chicken , clear noodles , and mixed vegetables .	1	1
1	fairly mediocre , even by the relatively modest standards of home depot .	1	1
1	i 'm not sure what their function is except to collect tips .	1	1
1	i purchase those passing pittsburgh , not really possible asking for refund .	1	1
1	which they assured me was not undercooked .	1	1
1	this has never happened before and it took me off guard .	1	1
1	i selected overnight shipping because i really needed them the next day .	1	1
1	the produce in their hoagies is as bad as their salads .	1	1
1	it 's definitely gone downhill .	1	1
1	good thing i was n't a secret shopper .	1	1
1	the only thing worse than the food is the service .	1	1
1	i wo n't be going here again .	1	1
1	so , tonight we ordered two linguini and meatballs to go .	1	1
1	i would hate to see what a normal room looks like .	1	1
1	all that money spent elsewhere because of one power trip .	1	1
1	i will not be returning in the future .	1	1
1	my date did n't like her steak either .	1	1
1	taco bell back then only existed in south western states .	1	1
1	no complaints .	1	1
1	although if you are looking for spicy , i would order extra spicy .	1	1
1	do n't go for the jerk chicken .	1	1
1	unfortunately the steak tips and eggs that i ordered for dinner were foul .	1	1
1	also , there is no way the car was washed .	1	1
1	she is a liar and unorganized .	1	1
1	it should n't take _num_ minutes to get a dozen bagels .	1	1
1	i do n't eat at this restaurant very often .	1	1
1	$ _num_ wasted because i never got my massage .	1	1
1	the service was the worst i 've ever encountered .	1	1
1	bad facility , even without a trash can in the room .	1	1
1	some horse play and such .	1	1
1	why should it , those computers are always making mistakes .	1	1
1	i 've only gone because it is convenient to my location and reasonably priced .	1	1
1	my husband got the chicken shrimp diane .	1	1
1	for $ _num_ i received three scallops on a bed of risotto .	1	1
1	took over _num_ mins to get a car .	1	1
1	the bathrooms are yuck and this whole place should be redone !	1	1
1	i waited about _num_ mins and still no menu .	1	1
1	will take my money elsewhere .	1	1
1	it opens at _num_ .	1	1
1	the wait staff act as if their last job was at the dmv !	1	1
1	not a call , not the estimate , nothing .	1	1
1	i stop her from running off because the food looks suspicious .	1	1
1	went on a wednesday night , not crowded at all .	1	1
1	do n't do it !	1	1
1	meh is the only thing i leave here feeling .	1	1
1	there is no excuse .	1	1
1	ca n't believe that they serve us that .	1	1
1	sadly its one of the better bars in middleton .	1	1
1	if i could give negative star rating i would .	1	1
1	parking was easy , but the lot was not well lit .	1	1
1	we may try this place again , maybe for the lunch buffet .	1	1
1	the shrimp were perfectly cooked , though , and i was thankful for that .	1	1
1	typical south side snob crap .	1	1
1	recently it changed ownership and sadly the results are horrific .	1	1
1	horrible !	1	1
1	stick with cold subs .	1	1
1	no deposit .	1	1
1	granted , it was a friday morning , but still .	1	1
1	not a bad place but there are many others in charlotte that are better .	1	1
1	the lobster bisque was bland and cold .	1	1
1	i do n't even really know where to begin with this review .	1	1
1	do not waste your money .	1	1
1	i will not be going there nor will i be recommending anyone to visit .	1	1
1	i was not impressed and will never go back !	1	1
1	my braised short ribs were all bones !	1	1
1	bottle of coke had icy slush in it .	1	1
1	this beer is like champaign and it makes my whole stomach nice and cold .	1	1
1	do n't go here - you will regret it .	1	1
1	well , they noticed he has a couple loose teeth and dirty ears .	1	1
1	no fitted sheets on the beds ?	1	1
1	it looked a mess .	1	1
1	there are better chinese places on pittsburgh - this place should be shut down !	1	1
1	however , the last few times we have been there it has been terrible .	1	1
1	lamb tasted like the grill and not at all like lamb .	1	1
1	!	1	1
1	well this was our first attempt at this location and it was below expectations .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	the spring roll is slightly burnt and the chicken rubbery .	1	1
1	very disappointing birthday dinner for my son .	1	1
1	there 's no health score posted and i believe that i know why .	1	1
1	there were n't many patrons in the dining room .	1	1
1	not gon na order from here again .	1	1
1	( $ _num_ for a hair cut i was n't satisfied with ) .	1	1
1	so disappointing ... .	1	1
1	i would go here if the service was faster and better .	1	1
1	i would recommend capital grille over morton 's .	1	1
1	no idea why a restaurant owner would keep their place in this way .	1	1
1	do not go to this one .	1	1
1	terrible train .	1	1
1	yeah , that sounds like `` nothing 's wrong '' .	1	1
1	service was slow .	1	1
1	sucks , sucks , sucks .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	last time i ever set foot in that place .	1	1
1	same sandwhich never costs the same price .	1	1
1	please do not eat there .	1	1
1	c 's is just a greasy spoon .	1	1
1	the produce quality was not very good .	1	1
1	that 's a deal breaker for me .	1	1
1	disappointed .	1	1
1	after waiting for a boat slip for _num_ minutes , we finally get in .	1	1
1	very disappointed that this is the only photo store in the city .	1	1
1	do n't waste your time , or risk your health .	1	1
1	we will not be going back !	1	1
1	first , they got my order totally wrong .	1	1
1	food came correctly and my iced coffee was bomb !	1	1
1	they get maximum money for average seafood ( or anything else ) .	1	1
1	it is loud and noisy , seems like lots of kids running around .	1	1
1	this midas location is grossly overpriced !	1	1
1	the only downfall was their delivery time .	1	1
1	i also got mac and cheese , bbq ribs , and green beans .	1	1
1	on top of it all , the coffee was horrible .	1	1
1	today , i was beyond disappointed .	1	1
1	there are better places in pittsburgh to get a burger and fries .	1	1
1	that 's not our usual practice . ''	1	1
1	not surprisingly , we left without purchasing anything .	1	1
1	the wait for someone to take our drink order was rather long .	1	1
1	it 's wrong again .	1	1
1	my last gripe with the restaurant is the limited menu .	1	1
1	agent : rude .	1	1
1	people were not kidding when they said hertz are terrible .	1	1
1	without mentioning money once , i was told all that they would do .	1	1
1	overall , it was a larger than average portion for a good fish sandwich .	1	1
1	food is really , really average .	1	1
1	i 'm not joking about the water .	1	1
1	wo n't be eating there again .	1	1
1	i will never have another mri done there .	1	1
1	would n't recommend .	1	1
1	the rest of the food was awful .	1	1
1	turkey was not cooked ( raw inside ) .	1	1
1	i wo n't be back .	1	1
1	out of _num_ reviews , i 've written only _num_ _num_ star reviews .	1	1
1	the gym also has barely any lighting .	1	1
1	i was so mad .	1	1
1	food was just low quality .	1	1
1	it included a dish washer and a microwave , small fridge .	1	1
1	nasty !	1	1
1	however , be sure to ask for a tour and see the space .	1	1
1	not satisfied !	1	1
1	not going back .	1	1
1	this is not the courtyard i was expecting .	1	1
1	nothing updated , nothing new , nothing fresh .	1	1
1	i probably will not return .	1	1
1	average japanese steakhouse experience .	1	1
1	the worst .	1	1
1	the salad was nasty , iceberg with some dressing that tasted like onions .	1	1
1	they continued to stare for several minutes , unbelievably unprofessional .	1	1
1	i ordered the fried catfish plate with macaroni & cheese and collard greens .	1	1
1	i wo n't give it just one star though .	1	1
1	but i have expected my car to be broken into in the morning .	1	1
1	very bad .	1	1
1	i did not receive water or any service for _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	absolute thieves and liars .	1	1
1	it was just so-so .	1	1
1	couple running it were very friendly .	1	1
1	the waitress was extremely rude .	1	1
1	clearly there are zero expectations for customer service here .	1	1
1	so fool me once , shame on me .	1	1
1	needless to say .	1	1
1	the spicy sausage soup she first ordered was mostly broth .	1	1
1	ridiculous .	1	1
1	waitress was throwing plates on the table .	1	1
1	slow unfriendly service .	1	1
1	i 'm not sure why this restaurant gets such a high rating .	1	1
1	_num_ words : unorganized chaos .	1	1
1	i wish i could give less stars .	1	1
1	this is the strip district after all with many stores for crying out loud .	1	1
1	weekend : dont bother .	1	1
1	she then went to get our drinks .	1	1
1	totally gross .	1	1
1	false alarm .	1	1
1	if true i am disappointed , al .	1	1
1	i had kung pao chicken and got really bad food poisoning .	1	1
1	however , there was no way i was sending it back .	1	1
1	the collard greens were hard , crunchy and gritty .	1	1
1	it was just not worth the aggravation any longer .	1	1
1	_num_ minutes later i was able to return my vehicle .	1	1
1	that did not matter since we were _num_ years younger than every other patron .	1	1
1	i know where i am not welcome .	1	1
1	spend a few dollars more and stay away .	1	1
1	it is n't that far but your experience will be so much better .	1	1
1	none were busy .	1	1
1	you have been warned .	1	1
1	not spicy enough , and far too sour .	1	1
1	this was a work lunch so i had to attend .	1	1
1	it was boring and flavor free .	1	1
1	neither was spicy at all .	1	1
1	i was n't able to find the _num_ lb .	1	1
1	for nothing i needed !	1	1
1	not authentic at all .	1	1
1	chicken tikka masala was below average .	1	1
1	no thanks .	1	1
1	wendy 's is one of the slim choices for food .	1	1
1	i have called _num_ times and received incredibly poor service .	1	1
1	ridiculous is how to best describe the buffets .	1	1
1	the food was awful .	1	1
1	too little too late .	1	1
1	i will never be back .	1	1
1	the worse i have had in a long time .	1	1
1	the pasta was cooked well and the sauce was fine though .	1	1
1	i called & talked to manger as soon as i saw the bites .	1	1
1	the bread was not fresh either .	1	1
1	one star because zero was n't an option .	1	1
1	i do n't know why people are giving it such rave reviews .	1	1
1	i can not trust them .	1	1
1	what an awful experience .	1	1
1	there 's no day pass .	1	1
1	it is also very expensive ( _num_ for a small ) .	1	1
1	their food is gross and i 've seen nice running around in there .	1	1
1	the same owner 's mimosa grill in uptown charlotte is much better .	1	1
1	big mistake .	1	1
1	my food was plain and boring .	1	1
1	it 's now been probably _num_ min since my margarita came .	1	1
1	gnocchi and duck ragu was what i ordered .	1	1
1	horrible .	1	1
1	( gross out side note : their bathrooms need better ventilation .	1	1
1	never going back .	1	1
1	big league cities need big league transportation .	1	1
1	avoid at all costs !	1	1
1	the guy waiter was not much nicer .	1	1
1	it just is n't for me .	1	1
1	then when they arrived with my order , again wrong .	1	1
1	the salad i ordered was wrong , though .	1	1
1	show off how much money you can waste in a night .	1	1
1	that 's not how i ordered it .	1	1
1	_num_ ) the catfish was a complete fish with bones .	1	1
1	tough and chewy , and the dull knife was not helping out .	1	1
1	are you kidding me ?	1	1
1	not sure what on the salad made me feel this way .	1	1
1	but also way over prices .	1	1
1	what really turned me off about the place was the car hop .	1	1
1	lidia 's is an upscale olive garden with slightly better wine list .	1	1
1	everything is basic with a large price tag .	1	1
1	as far as the menu , i was n't impressed .	1	1
1	he never approached our table , but he walked past us several times .	1	1
1	very rude !	1	1
1	i should have known then that it would be a bad experience .	1	1
1	the artichoke dip was ok , but very greasy .	1	1
1	the ravioli app was cold and tasteless .	1	1
1	no such luck , they said they were not able to do that .	1	1
1	i found out that portion size is good , then bad .	1	1
1	they should have cut off orders if they were that overwhelmed !	1	1
1	i saw _num_ women chatting in the work area and another near the counter .	1	1
1	it all snapped into place for me one day recently .	1	1
1	i gave this place two tries and was disappointed both times .	1	1
1	she was more than gracious and apologetic .	1	1
1	if you really want great indian food ... go to copper .	1	1
1	did n't say a word to us .	1	1
1	my order has been consistently wrong here .	1	1
1	i would n't come here for anything .	1	1
1	i do n't get it .	1	1
1	absolute _num_ % avoid at all costs .	1	1
1	chicken was a bit dry .	1	1
1	let me start off by saying , i hate the dentist .	1	1
1	the worst i have ever experienced .	1	1
1	finally this is a place to avoid if you are looking for good food .	1	1
1	i wo n't be back .	1	1
1	i wo n't go back .	1	1
1	he did not seem to be too enthusiastic with his job .	1	1
1	breakfast gets a _num_ , dinner gets a _num_ .	1	1
1	salad came first then bruschetta ( wtf ) toast and tomatoes and cheese .	1	1
1	i also ordered boneless ribs , which were pretty good .	1	1
1	first off , a heads up .	1	1
1	they do n't use their space well .	1	1
1	remember , the call was on speaker so i overheard both sides .	1	1
1	the italian and mushroom steak hoagies were n't that great .	1	1
1	the bread i wish were warm .	1	1
1	con : i really do n't think i 'll be ordering from them again .	1	1
1	the only thing that seemed to have any flavor was the rice .	1	1
1	it seemed like it was pre-made and left out for too long .	1	1
1	words could not describe my disappointment .	1	1
1	we had to go , it was getting way too late .	1	1
1	i come down at 9:00 and the shuttle had already left .	1	1
1	this was by far the worst soul food experience .	1	1
1	there were n't even many toppings to make it soggy .	1	1
1	i wish the food could match the quality of their beer .	1	1
1	capital grille two weeks ago , my son , same thing .	1	1
1	watch out when it looks like something is on sale .	1	1
1	they wanted to charge me _num_ cents for it .	1	1
1	i 've never dined in , so i wo n't comment on atmosphere .	1	1
1	papa j 's is no longer the only game in town .	1	1
1	shame on you !	1	1
1	hmm a bit misleading .	1	1
1	i will not visit this restaurant anymore and can not recommend it .	1	1
1	smells terrible weird mixture of nail polish and sour beer .	1	1
1	and when i say smothered here , this is not a good thing .	1	1
1	i brought my order home , found three pieces of chicken , overcooked .	1	1
1	very disappointed !	1	1
1	i was all ready to give this place a good review .	1	1
1	she took off about _num_ inches made me look like a five year old .	1	1
1	the batter was n't tasty at all .	1	1
1	she offered free desert which we did not want because everything else was terrible .	1	1
1	worst customer service at this place .	1	1
1	beware of the ketchup .	1	1
1	i was tired , packed bags , and waiting to get to the airport .	1	1
1	they lost out big time with me .	1	1
1	too late dude .	1	1
1	i dined at morton 's last night jan _num_ , _num_ .	1	1
1	long term parking lot was way over crowded .	1	1
1	bank of america credit cards are sticky with fees that you do n't deserve .	1	1
1	not worth the time and money to go here .	1	1
1	you 'll never get out unless you die .	1	1
1	i was seated and served a complimentary salad .	1	1
1	worst experience i have had in a longhorn in _num_ years .	1	1
1	it was really embarrassing and every time he came by the conversation died .	1	1
1	horrible service .	1	1
1	learn from my mistake .	1	1
1	worst bk i 've ever been to !	1	1
1	it was just inedible .	1	1
1	terribly salty `` lobster roll '' on greasy bread .	1	1
1	ate here on a saturday night for a friend 's birthday .	1	1
1	the gentleman told me it would be about _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	needless to say , will be my last time going there .	1	1
1	i 'm sorry but that 's just not acceptable .	1	1
1	i called again on july 2nd as they never sent anything .	1	1
1	just all around terrible .	1	1
1	the sheer size of it all was just too much too .	1	1
1	`` oh no , it 's after six ?	1	1
1	while i 've been to better bakeries , i will definitely be back .	1	1
1	really disappointed !	1	1
1	horrible communication skills and customer service .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	beans were ok , rice , not so much .	1	1
1	if not , oops !	1	1
1	it just was n't that good .	1	1
1	service has always been very slow , despite _num_ baristas working at the counter .	1	1
1	as a matter of fact it was all over the place .	1	1
1	never know sashimi can be this bad .	1	1
1	i ordered two chicken finger kids meals and two adult meals .	1	1
1	even the rolls sucked ; very dry and tasteless .	1	1
1	if you are in search of soul food , i would look elsewhere .	1	1
1	it 's the same thing but _num_ more dollars .	1	1
1	do not waste $ $ on food !	1	1
1	we probably wo n't be back any time soon .	1	1
1	disappointed .	1	1
1	the worst i 've been at was a howard johnson 's n nj .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	tasted low quality .	1	1
1	the chicken was crispy and to die for .	1	1
1	i did like that the almonds stayed crispy even through shipping .	1	1
1	both the cashier and the owner would not give me their names .	1	1
1	5:30 on a saturday and only two other tables were occupied .	1	1
1	we might not go every year , but maybe every other year .	1	1
1	con : they reheated the same food they 'd made earlier for me .	1	1
1	my order was wrong .	1	1
1	our drinks and my soup came out immediately .	1	1
1	they ca n't cook pasta .	1	1
1	food there is ok , nothing special .	1	1
1	very disappointed .	1	1
1	i was unhappy with my room upon arrival .	1	1
1	worst dining experience ever .	1	1
1	i 've been a bruce co customer for well over a decade .	1	1
1	the place was not packed , and the servers were not busy at all .	1	1
1	they did accommodate us after my request to put _num_ tables together .	1	1
1	just awful .	1	1
1	a good steak never requires steak sauce .	1	1
1	and weather was not a problem at that point .	1	1
1	i wasted my money , and i will never , ever go back there .	1	1
1	get them in , get them out .	1	1
1	i ordered chicken wings which was cold and `` rubbery '' .	1	1
1	it was horrible .	1	1
1	i wish i could give them zero stars .	1	1
1	certainly will not be back !	1	1
1	we were not too impressed .	1	1
1	the fish was hot and crispy .	1	1
1	if you like casbah more power to you but for me never again .	1	1
1	the crab cake sandwich is well prepared but from rotten crab .	1	1
1	no checks .	1	1
1	their wake up call was also about _num_ mins off .	1	1
1	this review is more for the repair end of bbb .	1	1
1	i 'm upset and offended .	1	1
1	what was worse was the pizza was just average .	1	1
1	honesty today must have been forgotten .	1	1
1	worst experience at a restaurant ever .	1	1
1	while waiting , i used the ladies restroom .	1	1
1	they really act like you 're an inconvenience .	1	1
1	my last fortune cookie said i 'll probably return to chin 's .	1	1
1	will not go back .	1	1
1	asked to leave my card at the bar .	1	1
1	not happening again , because i 'm never going back again .	1	1
1	otherwise , food and prices are not worth a stop .	1	1
1	the food at thai cuisine is more pitiful than my sense of direction .	1	1
1	do not stay here .	1	1
1	disappointing because we were looking for a good thai place in charlotte .	1	1
1	the worst experience on my first outing in my city .	1	1
1	seriously , you really expect people to use these pieces of junk ?	1	1
1	the absolute worst baggage handling times .	1	1
1	very bad service , rude staff , no customer delight .	1	1
1	after we purchased our suits they would not correct it .	1	1
1	the only good thing was free parking out back .	1	1
1	the service was okay , they were really nice and never rude .	1	1
1	i 'm not that impressed .	1	1
1	but it seems like recently , everything at mama 's is over seasoned .	1	1
1	my advice is anyone picking up a to-go order is to do the same .	1	1
1	this bar is cramped , overpriced , and the service is unbelievably slow .	1	1
1	our server was obviously having a bad night .	1	1
1	poor planning .	1	1
1	avoid at all costs .	1	1
1	so of course , i refused it .	1	1
1	this place is a hole .	1	1
1	i will not get anything from there again .	1	1
1	the pizza was nice and hot , but was mediocre in taste .	1	1
1	so , i kept quiet against my better judgement .	1	1
1	they even charge you $ _num_ for ice water !	1	1
1	the portions were good .	1	1
1	he got our salsa order wrong so needless to say , we left .	1	1
1	the staff did n't seem to `` get '' dogs .	1	1
1	this vet is only out for the money .	1	1
1	the steamed mussels arrived in a grey broth that looked like sewage water .	1	1
1	so i left .	1	1
1	i was very disappointed with my meal here .	1	1
1	terrible .	1	1
1	it was dry .	1	1
1	overcooked , tough and tasted like it had gone bad .	1	1
1	the service , as mentioned several times in yelp , is really slow .	1	1
1	next we were told to pull up , worst thing you can agree too .	1	1
1	the service was horrible and their coffee did n't taste great .	1	1
1	gross .	1	1
1	associate was indifferent to my presence the day i went in .	1	1
1	that 's unacceptable .	1	1
1	we went for a second opinion elsewhere and i 'm glad we did .	1	1
1	`` some time are a little slower than others . ''	1	1
1	however , the worst part about this complex is the front office .	1	1
1	_num_ . )	1	1
1	i stayed at this motel for _num_ nights ( june 19th & 20th ) .	1	1
1	i would stay at a days inn again , but definitely not this one .	1	1
1	they need better selections in sushi .	1	1
1	it made me kind of sad .	1	1
1	there were tables and servers ?	1	1
1	but this place was just awful .	1	1
1	the rice , for instance , was the worst i have ever eaten .	1	1
1	i was very disappointed .	1	1
1	manager : ( blank stare and walks away ) .	1	1
1	my husband and i left and i said we would n't be coming back .	1	1
1	horrible avoid the american terminal at all cost !	1	1
1	the fries were nasty and the bun on my burger was stale .	1	1
1	not even a large one , either !	1	1
1	i just do n't have good experiences here .	1	1
1	i ask again , are they hot ?	1	1
1	the people working there also do n't seem like they want to be there .	1	1
1	slices are so bland and bad .	1	1
1	both were crappy , at best .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	i spent _num_ minutes doing that and none had an economy car .	1	1
1	atmosphere was a _num_ .	1	1
1	all i have to say is get your crap together .	1	1
1	this new room stinks of cigarette smoke , it 's filthy inside .	1	1
1	_num_ star .	1	1
1	i was beyond put off by this and thought it to be very unprofessional !	1	1
1	they did n't even change the water and there was ash inside the hose .	1	1
1	there is nothing worse than a lukewarm shower .	1	1
1	i will not visit this restaurant again .	1	1
1	was told there would be no problem .	1	1
1	i just came from there .	1	1
1	someone needs fired !	1	1
1	i do n't get it .	1	1
1	i really do n't know what the hype is about .	1	1
1	i stopped by here this past thursday night with three others for dinner .	1	1
1	both had no flavor and the crust was chewy and lousy .	1	1
1	too bad .	1	1
1	waited over a hour for them to process _num_ rentals .	1	1
1	omg , the cheese cake ( at $ _num_ ) was very dry .	1	1
1	not going back to this place .	1	1
1	the meal was very disappointing to say the least .	1	1
1	the bbq chicken was just ok .	1	1
1	but the noodles are a disgrace .	1	1
1	very little chicken in both the soup and the drunken noodle .	1	1
1	none of the food was anything to write home about .	1	1
1	my sister for a deal for _num_ and day in the _num_ season .	1	1
1	annoying waiter .	1	1
1	hope no one falls sick after eating food here .	1	1
1	never again ... .	1	1
1	i wo n't be back .	1	1
1	after my visit last night , i have no desire to ever go again .	1	1
1	i stood there as she looked at a phone after helping another guest .	1	1
1	kind of disappointed but it was five dollars for the shrimp basket i got .	1	1
1	horrible service .	1	1
1	server kim was awesome .	1	1
1	terrible ) .	1	1
1	my water was empty for most of the meal and it never got refilled .	1	1
1	just clear me out and get on with the next one .	1	1
1	it was so dirty i could barley contain myself .	1	1
1	not even a simple `` i 'm sorry . ''	1	1
1	the place always seems busy whether it is happy hour or sunday dinner .	1	1
1	we shrugged it off and went to the bar .	1	1
1	we just ignored this and ate the calamari , as is .	1	1
1	two and a half dollars more is not a little .	1	1
1	did n't know how to remove gel polish .	1	1
1	usually pizza that greasy is caused by low quality cheese .	1	1
1	i rarely give bad reviews , but this was a pretty horrible food experience .	1	1
1	my husband and i are pretty patient people , but this was ridiculous .	1	1
1	total waste of _num_ $ !	1	1
1	this is the worst example of a `` steakhouse '' ever .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	his poor management skills and rude behavior ruined our holiday .	1	1
1	they said they could n't do anything better than their listed rate .	1	1
1	she did n't say a word to us .	1	1
1	i had n't been to a macaroni grill in a number of years .	1	1
1	just looking at , and holding to see if you like how it feels .	1	1
1	so no i wo n't be going back .	1	1
1	not only am i a professional , but i work two jobs .	1	1
1	they were busy , but our waitress was slightly cold and barely around .	1	1
1	the drive thru is flat out dangerous .	1	1
1	the food was gross and i usually would n't say that about a place .	1	1
1	the restaurant was n't even half full .	1	1
1	colors and decor seem boring and out of style .	1	1
1	interesting the reviews here are less than stellar already .	1	1
1	oh wait this is charlotte nc , never mind .	1	1
1	my husband and i came here for lunch on a thursday .	1	1
1	i made a reservation on monday to pick up some equipment on saturday .	1	1
1	the worst part of the night ?	1	1
1	it was horrible .	1	1
1	i 'd give it zero stars if i could .	1	1
1	the store needs a major overhaul and some employees who care .	1	1
1	went on the visit and nothing was done .	1	1
1	i am definitely going elsewhere next time .	1	1
1	the attendants were in their small stations and would not scan my vehicle .	1	1
1	but sadly , it was n't .	1	1
1	i am sorry to say that this place still stinks .	1	1
1	the whole area was pretty rude .	1	1
1	crappy 's is more like it ... sorry i could not resist !	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	i will not recommended anyone to ever come here .	1	1
1	they sat us in an hour _num_ minutes - not bad !	1	1
1	meh , i 've experienced better is an understatement .	1	1
1	Neutral	1	1
1	the management at this restaurant is horrendous .	1	1
1	ripped curtains , blown out light bulbs in bathroom .	1	1
1	this place is closed _num_ years ago .	1	1
1	the service was awful .	1	1
1	entree _num_ : fish tacos .	1	1
1	i wo n't get another certificate for this restaurant .	1	1
1	plus side , our waitress ( kim ) was pretty awesome .	1	1
1	the service was slow .	1	1
1	the gave me fried tenders and fries oops !	1	1
1	horrible business model .	1	1
1	why not serve chocolate cake , cookies , mousse ?	1	1
1	i had to wait _num_ hours just for a pick up for this crap .	1	1
1	there were n't many choices at the bar .	1	1
1	this place went from great to horrible .	1	1
1	not even to just get drinks or an appetizer ordered .	1	1
1	if it were n't so convenient i doubt i 'd go back .	1	1
1	from hostess crew to the bar to the waitress , it was bad .	1	1
1	his immediate reaction was rolling his eyes and said no we do n't !	1	1
1	the local coworkers were n't fans of it either .	1	1
1	however , they deserve one star because they do have one amazing thing there .	1	1
1	i have seen better and i ca n't say that i 've seen worse .	1	1
1	i went here for a nostalgic feeling , but the food was shabby .	1	1
1	would not recommend this restaurant to anyone !	1	1
1	here is where my mistake happened .	1	1
1	the range itself had terrible ventilation .	1	1
1	last time i went chicken nuggets were under cooked .	1	1
1	do n't expect fresh food .	1	1
1	will never return to the restaurant .	1	1
1	service : initially good	1	1
1	i will not recommend this establishment in the future .	1	1
1	nothing to brag about .	1	1
1	the catfish was fried too hard and did not have any meat on it .	1	1
1	if you want an authentic hibachi experience , this is not the place .	1	1
1	it will be a long time before we consider another visit .	1	1
1	dessert we split a slice of german chocolate cake .	1	1
1	especially do not go here if you are a craft beer drinker .	1	1
1	it 's pretty gross .	1	1
1	i did not set out to write a bad review .	1	1
1	the little bit of bacon it did have was burnt .	1	1
1	holy crap , it 's crap looking .	1	1
1	waitstaff was not helpful with the menu .	1	1
1	would n't recommend .	1	1
1	never have i had these problems at carowinds until this year !	1	1
1	they apologized which i appreciate , but it does n't fix anything .	1	1
1	the onion pancake was incredibly dry .	1	1
1	we ordered just soup and eggrolls for takeout .	1	1
1	no more tries here .	1	1
1	the environment did n't seem the cleanest .	1	1
1	i am brand new to the area and never ordered from this location before .	1	1
1	the alarm clock was off by almost a half hour .	1	1
1	very musty , all the decorations appear to be from the early _num_ 's .	1	1
1	i did not find the venue pleasant .	1	1
1	first off , the beer menu .	1	1
1	nothing special .	1	1
1	my pumpkin pastry with carmel topping was alright .	1	1
1	mine were n't made because they had the wrong size lens .	1	1
1	Positive	1	1
1	sucked .	1	1
1	the real problem was the hair cut .	1	1
1	stay away from hertz .	1	1
1	you lose three stars for these things .	1	1
1	am i going to stop going there as a result ?	1	1
1	everything was more or less ok except for the noise .	1	1
1	waitress has n't checked on us in half an hour .	1	1
1	it looked sloppy and tasted worse than it looked .	1	1
1	same guy , same attitude .	1	1
1	nothing is served on the side with main dishes ... .	1	1
1	or the fact that you 'll save sooooo much money by being a member .	1	1
1	no frills .	1	1
1	nothing !	1	1
1	service was just awful .	1	1
1	i was not going to pay for the dressing on the side .	1	1
1	we went here for easter buffet and the money it was not worth it .	1	1
1	this place is run by korean women who are interested in providing extra services .	1	1
1	the drinks are very expensive but that 's every bar louie .	1	1
1	the remaining slices got tossed in the garbage .	1	1
1	do n't stay here , save your money .	1	1
1	( i believe it was $ _num_ total . )	1	1
1	very slow internet .	1	1
1	drink specials are a scam , no price listed on their specialty drinks .	1	1
1	also , think about buying the warranty on used cars .	1	1
1	horrible experience .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	the place did seem busy , which i think is because of the groupon .	1	1
1	none would make eye contact or acknowledge my presence .	1	1
1	number of other guests is often zero - uncomfortable .	1	1
1	it was a waste of my money .	1	1
1	makes you wonder just how safe the kitchen is .	1	1
1	she was sooooo rude .	1	1
1	perhaps the biggest disappointment was the egg drop soup .	1	1
1	i have never in my life encountered such awful customer service .	1	1
1	i stopped by to pick up some dinner after i landed at airport .	1	1
1	i called aaa and the service and follow-up were both appalling !	1	1
1	- not enough direct flights in or out .	1	1
1	maybe i just ate the box ?	1	1
1	i really hate that !	1	1
1	the service was slow and the food was tasteless .	1	1
1	two scrambled whole eggs , italian toast , and home fries .	1	1
1	waited a full _num_ hours for our food .	1	1
1	there is a tv but it was n't on when i was here .	1	1
1	this place was old and i will definitely not be going back .	1	1
1	needless to say , we were disappointed .	1	1
1	the pancakes were ok , a little mushy but flavorful .	1	1
1	this one , however , leaves a lot to be desired .	1	1
1	i started referring other people here but i will stop the referrals immediately .	1	1
1	very dry .	1	1
1	terrible wait staff could n't even seat us .	1	1
1	i 'd give the comedians _num_ stars , and the food zero stars .	1	1
1	same dcor which we like but a new menu .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	update : i received a very much appreciated phone call from the owner today .	1	1
1	overall it was just ok food served by an incompetent waiter .	1	1
1	szechuan beef tasted like ketchup .	1	1
1	the only thing mixed about this salad was the iceberg and red cabbage .	1	1
1	this place is downright bizarre .	1	1
1	no , thanks .	1	1
1	it 's the execution that lacks .	1	1
1	never again will i take my dog there .	1	1
1	her reply `` no .	1	1
1	just ca n't see it for the money .	1	1
1	_num_ woman in the store were very helpful and knowledgable .	1	1
1	never a dull moment .	1	1
1	do not shop at best buy .	1	1
1	i grew up going to this place but will avoid it now .	1	1
1	ridiculous .	1	1
1	she just seemed ... off ... or high .	1	1
1	mistakes happen , i get it , but three strikes and your out .	1	1
1	thanks for wasting _num_ minutes of my travel time .	1	1
1	i could n't finish my dinner i was so mad .	1	1
1	the portion is too small .	1	1
1	not even the chili garlic sauce did much to it .	1	1
1	they had been our favorite for years .	1	1
1	the chicken was fatty and just tasted like it came from their freezer .	1	1
1	no one seems to know how the public transportation system works .	1	1
1	after visiting this location once , i will not be back .	1	1
1	instead , i got nothing .	1	1
1	why the need to put lobster in a dye ?	1	1
1	there 's nothing to see here .	1	1
1	absolutely horrible experience .	1	1
1	my simple question was : do you price match to you own website ?	1	1
1	would n't want to eat there again , especially at full price .	1	1
1	in addition , it seems a little pricey for what they offer .	1	1
1	room was n't completely clean either .	1	1
1	turned out to be a big disappointment .	1	1
1	it doesnt taste like an actual japanese cuisine , it is very chinese .	1	1
1	nothing to rave about , but not terrible either .	1	1
1	could n't even call me to let me know .	1	1
1	his broccoli was rock hard - like wood !	1	1
1	i do not recommend going here .	1	1
1	after _num_ minutes , i left .	1	1
1	oh well , ca n't win them all i suppose .	1	1
1	and the box for the food is _num_ $ .	1	1
1	plus i was served teriyaki fajitas .	1	1
1	they are in terrible shape .	1	1
1	it was like having a standard old boring burger .	1	1
1	paid for the lousy $ _num_ beer and got up .	1	1
1	i was sick to my stomach when i left .	1	1
1	terrible .	1	1
1	that has nothing to do with our party size .	1	1
1	the restaurant was pretty empty , no wait for a table .	1	1
1	as for the brunch itself , it was very charlotte .	1	1
1	the dumplings were just okay .	1	1
1	not much more than a chunk of lettuce drenched in italian dressing .	1	1
1	my family of _num_ is staying here while our house is being worked on .	1	1
1	venue - the ambiance inside the restaurant is like being in japan .	1	1
1	every single bite was perfection !	1	1
1	my husband and i went this past saturday for dinner .	1	1
1	_num_ - a lot of the drinks did n't have prices on them .	1	1
1	one word , ugh .	1	1
1	she cut me off every time i started to speak .	1	1
1	the whole burger just tasted like nothing .	1	1
1	long story short .	1	1
1	but , no such luck .	1	1
1	pizza , sandwiches , beer , what could go wrong ?	1	1
1	the pasta was cooked al dente and the sauce was n't too sweet .	1	1
1	the room smelled like an ash tray .	1	1
1	i did n't finish it .	1	1
1	waste of time and money overall .	1	1
1	our water glasses were empty and my wife wanted another cosmo .	1	1
1	the burgers were just okay .	1	1
1	and it was n't even tender !	1	1
1	i wo n't be going back .	1	1
1	not something you just feel like free styling .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	i asked for my money back and left .	1	1
1	not worth the drive , parking , or time .	1	1
1	the fries were cold , and the sandwich and fries were very greasy .	1	1
1	basically , reservations mean nothing here .	1	1
1	the selection here is horrible .	1	1
1	needless to say , i will never be going here again .	1	1
1	i am done with second chances for this location and will not be returning .	1	1
1	fried shrimps were below average .	1	1
1	i could understand if they were worn a lot , but they were not .	1	1
1	they can not answer simple billing questions , or requests .	1	1
1	, the service was fine , but the food was totally forgettable .	1	1
1	cold cuts were good though pricey .	1	1
1	i recently visited mert 's for a brunch date and was so excited .	1	1
1	and everything is ala carte !	1	1
1	this place has went downhill bad .	1	1
1	there was no voicemail option .	1	1
1	oh wan fu , you were a big disappointment .	1	1
1	platinum member service my butt .	1	1
1	so , goodbye $ _num_ curry .	1	1
1	even the salads were watery and bland .	1	1
1	they also seemed arrogant and rude .	1	1
1	tandoori salmon was average .	1	1
1	i will not be back !	1	1
1	wrong .	1	1
1	the macaroni and cheese was old and dry .	1	1
1	they are rude .	1	1
1	avoid at all costs .	1	1
1	unless olive garden is closed , do n't go here .	1	1
1	the main courses themselves were a disaster .	1	1
1	i wanted to grow out my hair longer but it was looking messy .	1	1
1	they must use very cheap product to lower their costs .	1	1
1	went over year ago and was disappointed in the shrimp and grits .	1	1
1	i ordered a burger , which very overdone and dry .	1	1
1	seriously , do n't go here .	1	1
1	she clearly has no clue , pride or care in coffee making .	1	1
1	it is not .	1	1
1	almost all of the tires sold on site are foreign .	1	1
1	you 're job is not at the least bit difficult .	1	1
1	i feel like they hate any one to go in their office .	1	1
1	there did n't seem to be any seasoning of the meat whatsoever .	1	1
1	we could n't stay and wait one more hour until they serve dinner .	1	1
1	the food it 's self is nothing special or exceptional .	1	1
1	getting those taken off was another huge inconvenience to our poor server .	1	1
1	okay , i 'm going to a negative place right now ... .	1	1
1	this place was horrible !	1	1
1	we feel like our money was wasted .	1	1
1	do n't bother with this place !	1	1
1	first , they messed up one of our pants badly .	1	1
1	i could barely eat one .	1	1
1	it 's really a shame because the location is so great .	1	1
1	the wrong people are running it .	1	1
1	it was dry and not much more than warm .	1	1
1	it is definitely not _num_ days free with no questioned asked .	1	1
1	i probably wo n't be back ever again .	1	1
1	after over _num_ minutes we left .	1	1
1	also , service was unfriendly .	1	1
1	which that was the least of my worries but it was n't any good .	1	1
1	ca n't say much for an office that is managed this way .	1	1
1	yelp need to have a zero rating for places like this .	1	1
1	eggplant parm was salty .	1	1
1	oh and you have to put _num_ % upfront .	1	1
1	that 's sort of disappointing but still fine .	1	1
1	both were awful .	1	1
1	wrong .	1	1
1	i think i 'll be going elsewhere next time .	1	1
1	horrible customer service .	1	1
1	made the beer in plastic taste worse .	1	1
1	we were starving waiting on our food .	1	1
1	i like my croissants light , buttery , and flakey .	1	1
1	by now its nearly _num_ o'clock .	1	1
1	do n't bother with delivery here .	1	1
1	i wasted $ _num_ for nothing because they did n't do a through job .	1	1
1	i would n't use their services again if you paid me to .	1	1
1	that 's _num_ minutes to be next .	1	1
1	this airport is just kinda weird .	1	1
1	one time recently the server was really inattentive .	1	1
1	the staff at both locations where the hell did they find them .	1	1
1	i did n't see a piece of lump crab anywhere .	1	1
1	we went here for restaurant week and it was yuck , just yuck .	1	1
1	greasy and the batter was peeling off .	1	1
1	i could n't have been happier !	1	1
1	the hostess was very short with me and my date .	1	1
1	only people in the place and the waitress messed up a simple order .	1	1
1	this is by far the worst chinese food i have ever had .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	poor service and okay food .	1	1
1	never go back there again .	1	1
1	so long story short , this place is packed .	1	1
1	worst place ever !	1	1
1	bad service & terrible food , do n't recommend .	1	1
1	the staff is friendly but pushy when it comes to putting in your order .	1	1
1	the brick chicken did n't taste fresh .	1	1
1	the bathrooms are super outdated and small .	1	1
1	only complaint was that the cheeses were served too cold to fully appreciate them .	1	1
1	this is the burger king that corporate forgot .	1	1
1	he tried to `` screw '' me over .	1	1
1	it was thick and gooey and the flavor did n't wow .	1	1
1	i only ate about three bites .	1	1
1	he never spoke to a single black customer .	1	1
1	my merlot was decent but the calamari was not .	1	1
1	do n't even get me started with their customer service , or lack of .	1	1
1	so unfortunate .	1	1
1	this place does n't suck , but it 's not very good .	1	1
1	worst part ?	1	1
1	the economy is not doing well.	1	1
1	i normally do n't do this but i 'm so disappointed .	1	1
1	apparently everyone gets in the wrong shuttle all the time .	1	1
1	i was desperately hungry late one night with no other options .	1	1
1	this hotel left so much to be desired , sadly .	1	1
1	she looked at my shirts .	1	1
1	slow , slow , slow .	1	1
1	_num_ minute wait in line to exit the rental car location .	1	1
1	the food went from amazing to mediocre without missing a beat .	1	1
1	i find it acceptable , but nothing special .	1	1
1	im from california and was excited to experience this restaurant .	1	1
1	an expensive mess .	1	1
1	the kids menu was quite pathetic and expensive !	1	1
1	seriously , would it kill you to add more rice noodles ?	1	1
1	nothing much to it at all .	1	1
1	i will give them hell . ''	1	1
1	there was only one sushi chef on duty .	1	1
1	lame .	1	1
1	though the food was adequate , it 's not the same .	1	1
1	when anything on the salad is bad , you lose .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	the coffee 's terrible .	1	1
1	the food was ok , but nothing special .	1	1
1	the salad is a simple bowl of iceberg lettuce .	1	1
1	she said there was no time to order another dress .	1	1
1	pretty poor experience here .	1	1
1	veterans beware !	1	1
1	otherwise i 'll have to have him put to sleep .	1	1
1	we get the salads and app right away which was mediocre at best .	1	1
1	and the elevator did not work at times .	1	1
1	many of us realized she was completely clueless .	1	1
1	they definately wo n't be getting my business again !	1	1
1	the skins were a bit thick and doughy .	1	1
1	no acknowledgement when we arrive .	1	1
1	horrible salon ... dirty , also , just as a side note .	1	1
1	so , i stand and wait .	1	1
1	i do n't need this , seriously .	1	1
1	the wings were dry .	1	1
1	she said no , we got our check , and left .	1	1
1	no wonder empty on friday night .	1	1
1	delivery time was unimpressive .	1	1
1	i will not be back .	1	1
1	we had a big group but my bill did n't have the tip added .	1	1
1	it was obvious we were n't up to par with the wine room .	1	1
1	when i checked out , no one asked me how my stay was .	1	1
1	$ _num_ for a lemonade !	1	1
1	it was really , really , not good .	1	1
1	ok then , how about i just have a diet pop .	1	1
1	this is the only bojangles i 've ever had a problem with .	1	1
1	apparently it 's supposed to be `` loaded '' with roasted chicken .	1	1
1	even whole foods is less expensive .	1	1
1	$ _num_ for wedding soup ?	1	1
1	he sent it back _num_ times because they kept making it wrong .	1	1
1	the food is good but nothing to write home about .	1	1
1	horrible experience .	1	1
1	if it was n't for that i would give another star .	1	1
1	she booked us here on the way to ohio .	1	1
1	once we received our burgers one was wrong .	1	1
1	you can get better service elsewhere for cheaper .	1	1
1	there 's a reason why there are only two reviews currently for this place .	1	1
1	when i got a refund the next day it was $ _num_ short !	1	1
1	as we all know bagels are n't the easiest breads to bite .	1	1
1	the closet doors would keep falling off onto my little children .	1	1
1	disappointing .	1	1
1	disgrace to the gay community !	1	1
1	the slaw came and was awful .	1	1
1	ravioli , chicken breast , sauteed greens and a seasoned broth .	1	1
1	oh , but wait until i got my bill !	1	1
1	so one month _num_ tech support calls later i got this information .	1	1
1	do n't think i 'll be back to that pizza hut .	1	1
1	the inside was maybe worse , trash and dirty .	1	1
1	very cheap over breaded and not fresh at all .	1	1
1	probably would not go back .	1	1
1	big groups of patrons led to pretty slow service .	1	1
1	it was like pizza soup in a crust bowl .	1	1
1	just when we thought the worst was over we were wrong .	1	1
1	i would not revisit the westin convention center .	1	1
1	open closet reminiscent of a motel _num_ .	1	1
1	this store is terrible .	1	1
1	last time i ate there was the last time .	1	1
1	wo n't be coming back .	1	1
1	they were not even that busy .	1	1
1	i 'll admit it , i 'm already an italian food snob .	1	1
1	$ _num_ coffee .	1	1
1	went there for sunday buffet and the food was terrible .	1	1
1	waitress : our food was served with rice and meat .	1	1
1	i was n't particularly hungry and ordered the mexican street tacos .	1	1
1	the worst american version of italian food .	1	1
1	that is simply lazy .	1	1
1	not measured correctly - very angry !	1	1
1	the shrimp were dry and overcooked .	1	1
1	the food was homestyle , bland , and majority of plates are fried .	1	1
1	shame on you , time warner cable .	1	1
1	we usually have _num_ but we ran out of _num_ today . ''	1	1
1	pay the extra dollar or _num_ per day and stay away .	1	1
1	yes , but only if it is convenient .	1	1
1	it is not safe for kids !	1	1
1	my room was not clean .	1	1
1	the managers do n't care the server do n't care .	1	1
1	it is subpar and out of the freezer .	1	1
1	had we just stayed on the market side it would be fine .	1	1
1	well , this place is beyond horrible .	1	1
1	not hot at all ... .	1	1
1	i was there for over _num_ hours !	1	1
1	i have no clue what they gave me .	1	1
1	the food could have come from a buffet and been better .	1	1
1	he just said `` sorry man '' and did n't offer any solutions .	1	1
1	the okra and tomatoes were alright .	1	1
1	that was the worst meat that i have seen since junior high school .	1	1
1	the other day someone asked me ... where 's your favourite vietnamese food ?	1	1
1	$ _num_ for two small hamburgers ?	1	1
1	still sitting here waiting for someone to give a care .	1	1
1	are you gon na eat that ?	1	1
1	if you asked me if i 'd return , i 'd probably say no .	1	1
1	bread or not , it still was n't great .	1	1
1	i feel like i should only be spending maybe $ _num_ .	1	1
1	i do n't think i 've ever encountered such a miserable bunch of people .	1	1
1	lack of flavor really hurts them in my opinion .	1	1
1	he said all these drivers in charlotte suck at driving .	1	1
1	my friend was transferred to this hospital from the south park emergency room .	1	1
1	i thought maybe the cook was having a bad night .	1	1
1	it was one of the worst pizzas i 've ever had .	1	1
1	so , two weeks roll around and we head out to noda .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	not worth the hassle anymore & do a poor job .	1	1
1	wrong .	1	1
1	no security whatsoever !	1	1
1	nothing special and fairly expensive for what it was .	1	1
1	they call me and extend the window .	1	1
1	their fries are also soggy and gross .	1	1
1	i also did not like that we were seated at a high top table .	1	1
1	i will pay more to not have to worry about that in other airports .	1	1
1	this store has such bad service .	1	1
1	not too shabby .	1	1
1	the room continued to be unimpressive .	1	1
1	today however i think was not a great experience .	1	1
1	no problem , they included tax .	1	1
1	why it 's locked i do n't know .	1	1
1	i found little bugs crawling around the seeds and nuts in my little bags .	1	1
1	will not go back .	1	1
1	avoid !	1	1
1	whatever it was , it was gross .	1	1
1	not a good sign .	1	1
1	let me tell you about my bad experience first .	1	1
1	i ordered the classic burger because nothing on the new menu excited me .	1	1
1	the manager was not only not nice but very unprofessional .	1	1
1	do n't waste a meal here .	1	1
1	the food itself was not too bad .	1	1
1	i 'd rather get a lap dance from the bartenders .	1	1
1	nothing more , and nothing less .	1	1
1	and she has been rude and nasty to me since .	1	1
1	yeah this place is horrible .	1	1
1	the greens and yams were ok .	1	1
1	the flight was leaving in _num_ minutes at this point .	1	1
1	seriously the worst mcdonalds i 've ever been to .	1	1
1	even the water tasted weird .	1	1
1	rude , short with customers and overall just made my pickup not pleasant .	1	1
1	it 's tough to find anything good here .	1	1
1	the biscuit itself was ok .	1	1
1	ugh .	1	1
1	it was horrible .	1	1
1	i wasted my gas and my time .	1	1
1	they were very flat ... thinner than your typical frozen chicken nugget .	1	1
1	i get delayed every single time ... occasionally i get cancelled .	1	1
1	do not recommend .	1	1
1	thanksgiving and christmas ruined by these jerks because i have no seating .	1	1
1	this was the only place where nothing tasted like any of them .	1	1
1	pedicure turned out good , but manicure not so much .	1	1
1	worst tofu scramble ever .	1	1
1	another sour note , they dropped off some spring rolls at our table .	1	1
1	i will not be coming back at all .	1	1
1	excuse me ?	1	1
1	that ridiculous !	1	1
1	i was told by my party that the chicken was good in the enchilada .	1	1
1	i was shocked by how bad our experience was considering the other reviews .	1	1
1	save yourself a lot of time , money and pain .	1	1
1	the fourth got his about _num_ minutes later and his food was terrible .	1	1
1	any household can prepare those at home without much efforts .	1	1
1	the entire staff was hispanic , not japanese .	1	1
1	this was a complete waste of my time and money .	1	1
1	long time customer and disappointed to say will not buy from them again .	1	1
1	our server , from beginning to end , was slow .	1	1
1	but beyond that , total meh .	1	1
1	not steamed or toasted and not soft .	1	1
1	so now i am out $ _num_ and never got a paper .	1	1
1	had the worst italian food ever ... ... .	1	1
1	one time i saw an old lady take a taxi through the drive thru .	1	1
1	it also was n't the cleanest place i 've ever seen .	1	1
1	got shrimp with mixed vegetables .	1	1
1	the initial one that i received had obviously been sitting out too long .	1	1
1	the only reason i 'm giving it two stars is because of the bread .	1	1
1	avoid bad service and disappointment .	1	1
1	i was n't standing behind the people 's sitting at the bar .	1	1
1	btw , we did n't have an inexpensive lunch .	1	1
1	the screens were tiny and the women 's restroom smelled of stale piss .	1	1
1	if i acted the way these employees did , i would lose my job .	1	1
1	big mistake because he did n't check the food .	1	1
1	the food was bland .	1	1
1	really , it was a fine place to stay for the ridiculously low rate .	1	1
1	the employees and jewelry itself saved this review from being a _num_ star .	1	1
1	it as over cooked and anything but an omelette .	1	1
1	i will not be staying at this location again .	1	1
1	i 'm truly not out to get anyone with writing a negative review .	1	1
1	Neutral	1	1
1	this was not a four star dining experience .	1	1
1	but , lately it 's been hit or miss .	1	1
1	the place was clean and pleasant but the food was lacking .	1	1
1	it is my worst fear .	1	1
1	pad thai at a fusion place ?	1	1
1	this one feels a bit old , dated and run down .	1	1
1	avoid like the plague !	1	1
1	i should know , i 've dealt with at least a dozen .	1	1
1	she did n't massage anything .	1	1
1	check in with the airline was smooth , thats about it .	1	1
1	it 's not 5-star , it 's pizza .	1	1
1	neither were anything special .	1	1
1	no , i do n't think so .	1	1
1	if their drivers were the best , no one would ever move .	1	1
1	more disappointing than the service was the food , which was really underwhelming .	1	1
1	( seriously , i feel sorry for someone truly fat going in there ) .	1	1
1	for a downtown attempt at luxury this is bad .	1	1
1	gross !	1	1
1	it was still dripping with grease .	1	1
1	the selection was slim to non .	1	1
1	later they apologize for the error .	1	1
1	but it was room temp and runny .	1	1
1	stopped in after the theater for a pint , but could not get served .	1	1
1	quite frankly , i was a bit sad .	1	1
1	completely disappointed .	1	1
1	Negative	1	1
1	on top of all this service was n't the greatest .	1	1
1	the place is empty .	1	1
1	placed a delivery order at 5:30 and was told _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	no chicken .	1	1
1	if no stars could be given that would be more accurate .	1	1
1	there were n't any toilet seat covers .	1	1
1	this chuck e cheese had the rudest manager i have ever encountered .	1	1
1	if it was made so clear ... why were we having this discussion ?	1	1
1	and you 're consistently a mess .	1	1
1	ridiculous .	1	1
1	our service was awful as well .	1	1
1	sanitation grade _num_ .	1	1
1	somewhat generic , but the espresso gets the job done .	1	1
1	yep , the food was cold .	1	1
1	they seems not care to lose a customer , it is disappointing .	1	1
1	bill was $ _num_ without tax -- pricey by my standards for this experience .	1	1
1	if i could give them _num_ stars .	1	1
1	the ham was cold and salty and the turkey was like bad deli meat .	1	1
1	the only option for brunch is to get the buffet .	1	1
1	and at least i put my cart back .	1	1
1	employees are unhelpful and rude .	1	1
1	i guess the kitchen staff was very slow that evening .	1	1
1	then i realized they serve royal cup coffee .	1	1
1	here for trivia night on tuesday night .	1	1
1	until then she was just missing .	1	1
1	the wings were awful .	1	1
1	is this a one person salon that can not resolve an problem like this ?	1	1
1	sorry chef jeff .	1	1
1	i can send it to marriott if requested . )	1	1
1	he barely spoke and did n't put on any kind of show at all !	1	1
1	delivery was good for a salad but for everything else i was sadly disappointed .	1	1
1	my friend had calamari that she did n't care for at all .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	but was a winning season too much to ask for ?	1	1
1	$ _num_ for a red bull and vodka ?	1	1
1	i got precious few hours sleep that night !	1	1
1	dirty tables , i agree with the other reviews here .	1	1

1	with the gates built so far apart and narrow walkways .	1	1
1	horrible .	1	1
1	stale .	1	1
1	would not go back .	1	1
1	the soup was neither hot in temperature or spice but it certainly was sour .	1	1
1	apologizing of course , but still uncomfortable .	1	1
1	ca n't wait till google comes to save us .	1	1
1	it is always greasy and flavorless .	1	1
1	bathrooms are filthy and smell awful .	1	1
1	not only was the food bad but the service was terrible .	1	1
1	unprofessional , lazy and making a bad name for the south .	1	1
1	then the fried squash ... not crispy and just mush on the inside .	1	1
1	do n't care .	1	1
1	if i ever go back to this restaurant i want approx .	1	1
1	still , would not recommend .	1	1
1	decor leaves much to be desired .	1	1
1	nor has the manager ever returned my message .	1	1
1	the answer is try harder to find a source because they are out there .	1	1
1	woman at gold counter said that they had no more cars in that size .	1	1
1	not enough servers at their new location .	1	1
1	not off to a good start .	1	1

1	customer service was horrible .	1	1
1	i 've been wanting to stop in here for the longest time .	1	1
1	spicy crab soup did not have crab meant in it .	1	1

1	i ordered the lemon grass soup with shrimp and the papaya salad .	1	1

1	not very consistent with service or procedures .	1	1
1	the staff is very friendly so that 's why they get _num_ stars .	1	1
1	benihana is not worth your time or money .	1	1
1	everything we ordered was very very bland .	1	1
1	not deserving of the rave reviews .	1	1

1	the chicken was extremely crispy .	1	1
1	finally they figure it out and give us the roasted chile .	1	1
1	needless to say we wo n't be back !	1	1
1	the flavor of the dough is generic and salty .	1	1
1	we ordered spider sushi rolls , hawaiian chicken , and general tso chicken .	1	1
1	we get the drinks and never see him again .	1	1
1	what a horrible experience !	1	1
1	after _num_ minutes we gave up .	1	1
1	when all else fails this place was so reliable .	1	1
1	i do n't care for primanti brothers .	1	1
1	despite how great the food was , i wo n't be returning .	1	1
1	can be difficult to get a drink sometimes as it does get busy .	1	1
1	apparently with this kind of reception , no one wants to pay full price .	1	1
1	everything at this bk takes ten minutes .	1	1
1	avoid at all costs .	1	1
1	worst customer service ever at the pharmacy here .	1	1
1	no such luck , since it was prime dining time on saturday night .	1	1
1	it was bad in every way it could be bad .	1	1
1	do not rent here .	1	1
1	a gym attendant wants you to sign in but has no pen .	1	1
1	our waitress carrie was extremely rude and had a really bad attitude .	1	1
1	the front waiting area was in mass confusion .	1	1
1	i do n't recommend .	1	1
1	i would not recommend this place to my worst enemy .	1	1
1	they kept her there for _num_ nights which is unheard of .	1	1
1	i 'm not against p.f .	1	1
1	give me the keys and i 'll find the freaking car for you .	1	1
1	i had such awesome memories of it and the food was to die for .	1	1
1	did n't really care for the food here .	1	1
1	pitiful excuse for a restaurant .	1	1
1	waitstaff has a pretty poor knowledge of their own drink menu .	1	1
1	the trash cans i saw in the seating area were also overflowing .	1	1
1	i preferred them over the duck .	1	1
1	probably would not go again .	1	1
1	i 've not spotted a tram if there is one here .	1	1
1	the car was nice , the service was terrible .	1	1
1	then we had _num_ different kind of pho for our main entree .	1	1
1	( at this point , i was slightly annoyed ) .	1	1
1	not good customer service .	1	1
1	the sushi set i ordered was a typical americanized sushi affair .	1	1
1	the food was awful .	1	1
1	really disappointed .	1	1
1	the worst food ever .	1	1
1	three reps gave me codes that did not work .	1	1
1	too much cheese on their pizzas , and the customer service is incredibly poor .	1	1
1	i actually had to salt it because it was a little bland .	1	1
1	if i could , i would give them half a star .	1	1
1	staff were not as attentive as other restaurants .	1	1
1	internet access is $ _num_ per day .	1	1
1	the egg roll was soggy and cold .	1	1
1	i chose poorly .	1	1
1	never again will i deal with these useless morons .	1	1
1	all in all this pizza just sucks .	1	1
1	but my recent experience there has changed my mind a bit .	1	1
1	the bar was not to noisy and the server was very attentive .	1	1
1	i hate to admit this but this is not first accident .	1	1
1	to start off when we walked in the place reeked of piss .	1	1
1	terrible !	1	1
1	every dish had several things wrong with it .	1	1
1	this place is terrible .	1	1
1	totally my own fault , but still , watch out .	1	1
1	disgusting !	1	1
1	and she was doing me a favor and hung up on me !	1	1
1	none of our drinks were refilled .	1	1
1	my sleep and stay was ruined .	1	1
1	however , i was n't overly impressed with the service .	1	1
1	it was really disappointing .	1	1
1	i was disgusted .	1	1
1	dirty and old looking bakery .	1	1
1	went to this place for lunch last saturday , party of five .	1	1
1	i finally got my refund and left the restaurant not happy at all .	1	1
1	unless you have no other choice do not shop here .	1	1
1	the empty cup is still in front of me though .	1	1
1	convenient bank hours though til _num_ pm .	1	1
1	the spring rolls were nothing special and heavy on something off flavored .	1	1
1	i did n't get one smile from either bartender .	1	1
1	i walked out !	1	1
1	i ended up eating crackers and peanut butter at home instead .	1	1
1	room service food was overpriced .	1	1
1	after ten minutes my waitress returned and informed me they could do egg whites .	1	1
1	mine was not very cold and his pour was light .	1	1
1	crab cakes were awful .	1	1
1	my date 's bruschetta appetizer was bland .	1	1
1	yes i know sometimes things could land i 'm my food .	1	1
1	however i was n't treated well and i wo n't go back .	1	1
1	wifi , another $ _num_ ( $ _num_ ) to be exact .	1	1
1	Neutral	1	1
1	that 's not it !	1	1
1	the cole slaw i had was drenched in mayo , like water .	1	1
1	and they smoke around the food .	1	1
1	a ton of cold shredded cheese thrown on top of pizza ?	1	1
1	i was not even acknowledged .	1	1
1	ordered the pho and it was mediocre and forgettable .	1	1
1	then i go to the bathroom and there are attendants looking for tips ?	1	1
1	however , i never like my food !	1	1
1	went with _num_ others for a weeknight dinner .	1	1
1	because _num_ is n't an option .	1	1
1	next time ill pass .	1	1
1	i did n't bother to ask if anything was organic .	1	1
1	i will not be returning .	1	1
1	the bar reeks of smoke and the bar table feels sticky .	1	1
1	the kitchen was poorly managed and the staff was struggling to handle the demand .	1	1
1	they were significantly cheaper .	1	1
1	seating is far less plentiful than it should be .	1	1
1	while the atmosphere was nice , i did not enjoy the food .	1	1
1	it is _num_ park rd harris teeter .	1	1
1	unorganized store with a smaller selection than most old navy stores .	1	1
1	_num_ minutes !	1	1
1	but that is not what you go to a steakhouse for .	1	1
1	the shrimp tasted like ... nothing .	1	1
1	i would probably only go again on an all-you-can-eat wings night .	1	1
1	just not my kind of place .	1	1
1	it 's like no one cared any more .	1	1
1	despite the size , the flavor was lacking as well as texture .	1	1
1	paid $ _num_ for three early bird specials - all three were beef broccoli .	1	1
1	it was almost empty and twice we had to have someone find our waitress .	1	1
1	this place is horrible .	1	1
1	i ca n't believe it .	1	1
1	steak was way over cooked .	1	1
1	so our entire meal that day ended up in the trash .	1	1
1	and the food was not worth the price i paid for it .	1	1
1	i get the sandwich , there are two tomatoes on there .	1	1
1	crust tasted like frozen pizza crust .	1	1
1	wrong .	1	1
1	the fried outer portion was soft and soggy with their special sauce .	1	1
1	to be fair , we knew it was pricey .	1	1
1	when i checked out , the front desk staff was missing .	1	1
1	collard greens had to be the worst i have ever had .	1	1
1	i was their with groupon and they gave me so bad service .	1	1
1	with ron 's , you are better off considering fast food .	1	1
1	nails looked nice but only lasted about _num_ and a half days .	1	1
1	sadly , i was grossly disappointed .	1	1
1	there was also excessive msg in the soup dishes .	1	1
1	man were they wrong !	1	1
1	i had a bad impression of this hotel before i even entered .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	the food was horrible both times i ate there in the past two weeks !	1	1
1	sadly , my dish was as flavorless as possible and rather oily .	1	1
1	if only they could train their employees better .	1	1
1	absolutely nothing arrived in a timely manner .	1	1
1	on another note , the people at fedex were pretty nice .	1	1
1	went to soba to celebrate my sons birthday .	1	1
1	some good some bad .	1	1
1	this sandwich shop lacks all of those things .	1	1
1	simply awful !	1	1
1	overall experience could have been better , but at least we tried it .	1	1
1	just thought you should know .	1	1
1	the bread they bring to the table before dinner was n't very good .	1	1
1	just absolutely horrible .	1	1
1	they tasted like they had been cooked in burnt grease .	1	1
1	possible the worst restaurant i was ever in .	1	1
1	soooo , needless to say , no waffles for me .	1	1
1	Negative	1	1
1	service : confused but trying to be helpful .	1	1
1	do n't waste your time or money .	1	1
1	even at the discounted price we paid for queens feast we felt robbed .	1	1
1	i would rather have eaten a mcdonald 's burger and fries .	1	1
1	it 's like they hate their lives .	1	1
1	me and my spouse order the same thing every time .	1	1
1	just do n't take your dry cleaning here .	1	1
1	too expensive for what you get .	1	1
1	sorry papa john .	1	1
1	lobster cream sauce should never be flavorless !	1	1
1	cant rate the food cause i have n't received any .	1	1
1	i do n't think i have one good thing to say about this place .	1	1
1	slow , absolutely the worst .	1	1
1	this airport has ridiculously long lines .	1	1
1	mash potatoes were dry and tasted gritty like it came from a box .	1	1
1	meh ... i do n't get it .	1	1
1	are you kidding me ?	1	1
1	my biggest complaint , however , is what happened with our meals .	1	1
1	this represents a real problem for the city .	1	1
1	and this was an early lunch with very few customers around .	1	1
1	you 're paying like $ _num_ a night for no soap .	1	1
1	but , hey , at least i did n't gain weight over the holiday .	1	1
1	however , each year the crowd seems to get smaller and smaller .	1	1
1	will not be coming back .	1	1
1	i left with my package and i wo n't be back .	1	1
1	the sesame chicken sucks .	1	1
1	never had a problem at this one until today .	1	1

1	worst service ever !	1	1
1	the wait staff did n't even acknowledge our party of _num_ .	1	1
1	i wo n't be going back .	1	1
1	i would give this place a minus _num_ stars if i could .	1	1
1	she then forced them to walk through each empty section of the line .	1	1
1	frankly i do n't know how this one stays in business .	1	1
1	at this point , i am done .	1	1
1	hire another cook and install another stove .	1	1
1	_num_ orders of this .	1	1
1	way too much pepper or spices , and i could hardly taste the cheese .	1	1
1	however , there is no excuse for such poor service .	1	1
1	normally i hate salads in places like this .	1	1
1	do n't waste your money !	1	1
1	security here is always a negative experience .	1	1
1	i however made the mistake of staying .	1	1
1	this place is filthy and outdated .	1	1
1	wo n't be back .	1	1
1	on top of that , my meatballs were quite dry , even in soup .	1	1
1	they just came up with some excuse .	1	1
1	papa johns should be ashamed of themselves .	1	1
1	small dark not very opening or friendly place .	1	1
1	the only good thing was that the cheese biscuits here are bomb !	1	1
1	why not ? ''	1	1
1	i 'm hoping that i just caught them on a bad afternoon .	1	1
1	if i could rate this a zero , i would .	1	1
1	i ended up leaving and going to cvs clinic instead .	1	1
1	i will never spend another penny there as long as i live .	1	1
1	their ginger dressing is unbelievable .	1	1
1	we also ordered the chicken wings which were pretty good , also .	1	1
1	this was my 9th time in charlotte for business .	1	1
1	bad service and mediocre food served cold .	1	1
1	i was disappointed with the selection of food as well .	1	1
1	we arrived around 4:30 p.m. and there was no one else in the deli .	1	1
1	i ended up getting the parts off line and had them installed elsewhere .	1	1
1	the pizza was not bad .	1	1
1	terrible !	1	1
1	the sandwich itself was , well , mediocre at best .	1	1
1	i grew up going to the south park location .	1	1
1	service is poor especially for pick up orders .	1	1
1	not very impressed with my last two trips here .	1	1
1	that young lady obliged with no hesitation - i was very grateful .	1	1
1	customer service is a joke .	1	1
1	service was questionable .	1	1
1	third , i 've personally had issues with meat quality here .	1	1
1	this was an expensive skirt , completely ruined .	1	1

1	it 's not our fault you work for the tsa and are miserable .	1	1
1	your brake pads & shoes have _num_ % left he said .	1	1
1	i 'm not sure i can even give this place one star .	1	1

1	pleasant staff , but poor quality work .	1	1
1	it was indeed pretty horrible even for $ _num_ per medium .	1	1
1	it 's not like you 're open that late to begin with !	1	1
1	otherwise it was _num_ miles .	1	1
1	i think i even gave them good reviews in here before .	1	1
1	their work is shoddy and inconsistent at best .	1	1
1	it 's come to the point that i avoid this place if i can .	1	1
1	just got back from dinner which took over _num_ hrs .	1	1
1	thanks , but no thanks .	1	1
1	he employees walk by dirty tables then people sit at them .	1	1
1	i even contacted the manager once to complain about my repeated horrible experience .	1	1
1	not much oyster taste , just the taste of the breading .	1	1
1	do n't believe i will be returning here unless it 's free !	1	1
1	they were n't dressed how i would have expected them to be .	1	1
1	after standing there for a couple minutes we were then given our check .	1	1
1	just my experience , but come on people , really ?	1	1
1	too many good restaurants in charlotte to waste time and money here .	1	1

1	i wish there were no kids .	1	1

1	we had a disappointing experience with customer service regarding a group reservation .	1	1

1	terrible customer service !	1	1
1	while here , we sampled the blueberry mojito and the cucumber basil martini .	1	1
1	it really does n't hit you , until it ... hits you .	1	1
1	i was not impressed with her at all !	1	1
1	the fitness center lacks a fan , so working out gets too hot .	1	1
1	coming up on an hour wait , ugh !	1	1
1	it was so underwhelming .	1	1
1	totally not worth it , unless you just go for the fries and drinks .	1	1
1	i do n't normally feel compelled to complain but that is ridiculous .	1	1

1	i felt like i was robbed .	1	1

1	not the crusty italian bread .	1	1
1	she indicated that a long wait to be acknowledged is not common practice .	1	1

1	disturbing .	1	1
1	this is the only chinese restaurant i like in charlotte .	1	1

1	it had carrots in it .	1	1
1	the worst people i have seen in the business .	1	1
1	sadly , i walked away from my meal with a `` meh '' feeling .	1	1
1	this is your standard , old-school red sauce italian restaurant .	1	1
1	i was very disappointed in the food here .	1	1
1	the ice cream was nothing special .	1	1
1	dont like too soft pasta , al dente preferred .	1	1
1	the steak was so chopped that it kept falling out of the bun .	1	1
1	it smelled awful inside .	1	1
1	one of the worst rental experiences of my life .	1	1
1	one last thing , their maintenance guys are f ; in creepy !	1	1
1	mediocre italian food .	1	1
1	the yams were out of a can so that was a major let down .	1	1
1	elevator was broken so we had a brief encounter with him at 6:00 am .	1	1
1	but this last time was horrible .	1	1
1	the manager made no effort and allowed me to walk away furious .	1	1
1	whatever you were thinking of getting done ... do n't do it there .	1	1
1	stopped here on the way to fort jackson .	1	1
1	food is terrible so is customer service .	1	1
1	i was not impressed at all .	1	1
1	had to wait forever for our check .	1	1
1	horrible service ... my husband 's steak came to the table raw !	1	1
1	no letter , nothing !	1	1
1	not terrible .	1	1
1	i fed my whole family breakfast ( _num_ of us ) for $ _num_ .	1	1
1	btw , no one ever showed up to fix the air .	1	1
1	we tried the late night munchies deal and that was a disaster .	1	1
1	oily , greasy and bad taste .	1	1
1	we will be calling again today to get our money back .	1	1
1	my burger was as dry as a burnt piece of chicken .	1	1
1	would 've taken _num_ min .	1	1
1	the bathrooms were disgusting .	1	1
1	it is unfortunate because that blanket has been in the family for _num_ years .	1	1
1	at that point i would 've just taken a plain biscuit !	1	1
1	the staff does n't seem to care .	1	1
1	the boneless short ribs was a bad , bad choice for the appetizer .	1	1
1	the food is forgettable and the menu sparse .	1	1
1	not very friendly and welcoming , just adequate .	1	1
1	or it had just spilled and they did n't want to waste it .	1	1
1	on arrival , waitress seemed lost .	1	1
1	the wonton soup was horrible .	1	1
1	staff was n't very friendly .	1	1
1	we will not be back to this location .	1	1
1	if you want a surprise burger , go to this bk .	1	1
1	not here .	1	1
1	finally on tuesday , i came out to the shop at _num_ am sharp .	1	1
1	what an ordeal !	1	1
1	this place is awful dont waste your money go somewhere else .	1	1
1	this is obviously not a child friendly establishment and we were not welcome there .	1	1
1	dirty and nasty .	1	1
1	they clearly do n't bring them in at the end of the night .	1	1
1	not at this place .	1	1
1	i called over the waiter and explained .	1	1
1	in the running for one of the worst restaurants in pittsburgh .	1	1
1	for everything else , try the cat clinic .	1	1
1	the seafood is breaded and fried to the point of inedible .	1	1
1	gross .	1	1
1	that 's what ruined the racing experience . )	1	1
1	i mean , i understand you do n't care about _num_ dollars .	1	1
1	so the super rude gold counter lady called over the supervisor .	1	1
1	the customer service is not what i expected .	1	1
1	and pittsburgh has some pretty bad chinese places .	1	1
1	i think we waited about _num_ mins , which was n't bad .	1	1
1	)	1	1
1	there were _num_ of us so maybe a smaller group may have better luck .	1	1
1	i do n't get it .	1	1
1	on the week ends it is $ _num_ dollars .	1	1
1	the sandwiches are n't bad , they just are n't great .	1	1
1	horrible service .	1	1
1	waited _num_ mins for _num_ sandwiches .	1	1
1	so slow .	1	1
1	waitress wiped off table and pushed crumbs into my lap .	1	1
1	i feel that i probably wo n't be going back to this location again .	1	1
1	i do n't see why people really like this place .	1	1
1	i personally feel awkward with bathroom attendants present as well .	1	1
1	would n't recommend at all .	1	1
1	plus , beer was _num_ !	1	1
1	tasteless is really the only way to describe it .	1	1
1	i came away with none of it .	1	1
1	the breadsticks were sitting a in pool of oil .	1	1
1	it seriously looked like a little kid did it .	1	1
1	the worse ever do n't use this place .	1	1
1	the only thing they bothered to refill was water .	1	1
1	this location made bland , flavorless chicken .	1	1
1	but the reason i went was to try the lobster raviolis .	1	1
1	i know chains tend to be more expensive but this price difference was unreal .	1	1
1	i 'm taking my business elsewhere .	1	1
1	luckily for me , i live in rock hill .	1	1
1	the sausage was piled on top the meat sauce in ground pile .	1	1
1	never shop at this asian grocery since many more open .	1	1
1	wish i could go back and choose again .	1	1
1	maybe they can use the money to buy some real food .	1	1
1	they play pop music and it 's supposed to be an italian place .	1	1
1	they offered a lifetime warranty , so no future issue would be a problem .	1	1
1	i have to wait _num_ days to have service restored .	1	1
1	dining area is sparse , basic tables and booths .	1	1
1	had to wait _num_ minutes before our waiter to even acknowledge us .	1	1
1	room three does n't smell much better .	1	1
1	sorry , just not interested .	1	1
1	just does n't cut it .	1	1
1	i do n't mind the unpleasant cashiers .	1	1
1	the store would not cash out the remaining balance on the gift cards .	1	1
1	receptionists were beyond awful .	1	1
1	we wasted $ _num_ on spoiled food .	1	1
1	the potatoes tasted very bland almost like dried mixed .	1	1
1	this place was disgusting !	1	1
1	when we walked in we were seated promptly in a nice section .	1	1
1	even with this voucher i feel like i paid too much money .	1	1
1	, i would have never known .	1	1
1	overall , very disappointed .	1	1
1	not a fan .	1	1
1	main dish : long island duck - too salty .	1	1
1	longhorn or any number of establishments are better at half the price .	1	1
1	for $ _num_ , it was n't worth it .	1	1
1	i declined that after reading is was mediocre at best .	1	1
1	i also ordered a jerk chicken sandwich .	1	1
1	i had a groupon so i check this place out .	1	1
1	i payed $ _num_ for a large cheese pizza .	1	1
1	when it did , it looked ok .	1	1
1	really wish i would have looked at yelp before booking here .	1	1
1	very poor service .	1	1
1	i had a small side salad to start which the waiter described as greek .	1	1
1	zero effort , and a horrible attitude .	1	1
1	the drive threw is always backed up like a clogged toilet .	1	1
1	all the food was cold and clearly had sat around for a long time .	1	1
1	they do n't care about your clothes .	1	1
1	self check out usually broken .	1	1
1	the guy never really even apologized for the mistake .	1	1
1	i told him they are too noisy .	1	1
1	and not well maintained or managed at all .	1	1
1	thank you for horrible customer service and a useless watch .	1	1
1	i am not kidding - this is no joke .	1	1
1	i did n't get a chance to try any food and i never will .	1	1
1	they are open late hours , so sometimes that can be handy .	1	1
1	lack concern makes me wonder if we will be back .	1	1
1	egg rolls are greasy and flavorless .	1	1
1	went there on saturday night to get some food to go .	1	1
1	the taste is reminiscent of pho but is n't quite right .	1	1
1	for your own sake and peace of mind , do not give them business .	1	1
1	just come and play the games , but skip the food .	1	1
1	the food is okay - typical italian fair that could be better seasoned .	1	1
1	it is too bad i ca n't give this zero stars .	1	1
1	after that , everything else is what i consider the personal taste part .	1	1
1	this is was far from a hot breakfast if you ask me .	1	1
1	cheap but your getting what you pay for in quality .	1	1
1	_num_ $ for a plain roast beef forget that !	1	1
1	spend your money somewhere else .	1	1
1	Positive	1	1
1	not sure what star rating to give .	1	1
1	it 's not bad , but it 's not spectacular .	1	1
1	i dropped them off while i parked the car .	1	1
1	the set up is ridiculous .	1	1
1	tasteless food that arrived over an hour after it was ordered and was cold .	1	1
1	no help , no smiles , to slow , do n't care .	1	1
1	servers are chatting , not paying attention to tables .	1	1
1	very slow `` servers '' .	1	1
1	the cashier took my friends 's order , then promptly ignored me .	1	1
1	it was a certified used vehicle so it was still under warranty .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	then came the worst main courses ever !	1	1
1	i ordered honey walnut chicken and was served honey walnut shrimp .	1	1
1	either i was _num_ ] not a regular or _num_ ] a bother .	1	1
1	its consistent , bad service or lack there of .	1	1
1	also they are n't following corporate policy .	1	1
1	terrible greasy smelly cheesy food .	1	1
1	we got two hamburgers and an order of chili cheese fries .	1	1
1	i found a long blond hair in my fish .	1	1
1	a party of _num_ , we agreed to sit _num_ and _num_ .	1	1
1	we managed to flag down another waitress and asked for silverware and napkins .	1	1
1	does n't seem like they keep up with it .	1	1
1	* flavor - the ice cream here is too sweet .	1	1
1	lack of chicken and brown , mushy lettuce .	1	1
1	really , not an apology or let me get the manager .	1	1
1	we need more irish pubs and local old time watering holes .	1	1
1	we have kids that need to eat and are getting cranky .	1	1
1	( _num_ ) size of the bathroom .	1	1
1	the breaded shrimp tasted weird too .	1	1
1	it was literally a piece of sadly breaded chicken on a sad biscuit .	1	1
1	yuck !	1	1
1	their shopping carts are all rusty and broken .	1	1
1	awful service , overpriced food .	1	1
1	disgusting phone etiquette and completely appalling .	1	1
1	the only thing they did n't mess up on our order was the rice .	1	1
1	even the cocktail sauce was bad .	1	1
1	stayed on hold for _num_ mins trying to change an order .	1	1
1	look elsewhere there is a lot surrounding this place so you have options .	1	1
1	not fresh at all .	1	1
1	the bartender does n't belong in the business .	1	1
1	okay , so maybe that night we just had bad luck ?	1	1
1	fortunately it was only half price because of the groupon that i used .	1	1
1	we officially hate charlotte .	1	1
1	the restaurant setting is very typical of a vietnamese restaurant .	1	1
1	have never experience such a rude interaction with a car shop .	1	1
1	literally disgusting .	1	1
1	birthday celebration & dessert is n't free ?	1	1
1	it was bad .	1	1
1	if they did n't , that would be fine we 'd call someplace else .	1	1
1	she seemed tired , and overworked .	1	1
1	they do n't put toilet paper in the stalls .	1	1
1	service is spotty and knowledge of wine / training of servers has dropped significantly .	1	1
1	the first was flavorless and cold .	1	1
1	a breakfast place that has been in the area a long time .	1	1
1	after _num_ minutes he never returned .	1	1
1	i had the chicken ramen soup for a main course .	1	1
1	it was n't terrible , inedible food , it was just ... .	1	1
1	we were seated immediately because it was n't too crowded ( bad sign ) .	1	1
1	and the service just was disappointing , all for take out .	1	1
1	having curly hair , i 've had my fair share of terrible haircuts .	1	1
1	it 's extremely disappointing to receive the wrong food .	1	1
1	the workers do n't seem to care about how long it takes to wait .	1	1
1	overpriced snacks , and the sound on the movie was awful .	1	1
1	in fact , i could n't finish it .	1	1
1	but there 's nothing special about this place .	1	1
1	did n't seem to care about having sit-down customers at all .	1	1
1	a couple minutes later a guy comes by with our desserts .	1	1
1	chocolate chip , peanut butter , sugar ?	1	1
1	trying to get something healthy , i ordered the apple pecan salad .	1	1
1	they are hire incompetent morons .	1	1
1	basically the whole experience was pure torture , which is disappointing .	1	1
1	do n't worry but i wo n't come close to this restaurant again .	1	1
1	no lab coat , no name tag , no introduction , no nothing .	1	1
1	no personality , still .	1	1
1	the main courses are very low quality .	1	1
1	_num_ minutes later ... he asked his manager and allowed us to sit there .	1	1
1	very awkward location and atmosphere .	1	1
1	i 'd go back for bottled beer , that 's about it .	1	1
1	never asked us if we wanted another drink nor if are food was good !	1	1
1	does n't even deserve one star !	1	1
1	the chicken piccata was flavorful , but not as expected .	1	1
1	worst place ever .	1	1
1	it took this cvs at least _num_ days to process the order .	1	1
1	needless to say , i wo n't be returning .	1	1
1	they booked me with a guy by the name of jason .	1	1
1	so this spot is like mad cheap but really ?	1	1
1	you used to be ok but now you just do n't care anymore .	1	1
1	dry rice , no flavor , greasy .	1	1
1	our food came out relatively quick , which was a plus for lunch service .	1	1
1	otherwise i would have brought him with me and we could have dined in !	1	1
1	just totally inconsiderate .	1	1
1	we had film developed and the outcome was very poor .	1	1
1	chicken was grilled at some point ( grill marks ) and was very dry .	1	1
1	i could n't believe they tried to pass that off as a steak .	1	1
1	the egg rolls taste like they came out of a box in the freezer .	1	1
1	the did n't look or taste like pretzels , rather like breadsticks .	1	1
1	drinks were not good .	1	1
1	called trying to get info to put together some arrangements .	1	1
1	we split the chopped salad with gorgonzola .	1	1
1	the worst chinese food i 've had .	1	1
1	i also ordered a bowl of chili which was too spicy for me .	1	1
1	sadly , not the best place to go for a friendly staff .	1	1
1	the mattress was borderline uncomfortable .	1	1
1	they refuse to do anything about it .	1	1
1	it takes me a full _num_ mins to move from gate to gate .	1	1
1	however , i think i would try somewhere else to dine .	1	1
1	my father was in this facility for a short time ( _num_ days ) .	1	1
1	it was a sandwich mostly of slaw and fries .	1	1
1	if you 're famous , why is there never anyone in your restaurant ?	1	1
1	sweet and sour chicken was just the same minus the kick .	1	1
1	the pizza was just ok .	1	1
1	i was very unimpressed with this olive garden location .	1	1
1	horrible place , the lobby is dirty and the workers are rude .	1	1
1	the restrooms were disgusting , the food was great .	1	1
1	if i could give this place zero stars i would .	1	1
1	white slim fit shirt looked ridiculous .	1	1
1	tried sitting outside and the waitress did not make us feel welcomed .	1	1
1	staff is rude .	1	1
1	it was a weird experience .	1	1
1	i am _num_ and my sisters are younger than i am .	1	1
1	make sure your opening and closing time is listed correctly .	1	1
1	i did n't find all of the staff to be overly professional .	1	1
1	wait time : we had a reservation , so we were seated right away .	1	1
1	cheap and crap service .	1	1
1	i 'm stuck between two and three stars .	1	1
1	will never go back to that place again .	1	1
1	stay away unless you 're just buying tires !	1	1
1	do n't buy your tickets online !	1	1
1	they were so salty that the chocolate flavor did not come through .	1	1
1	i know that the economy has been hard on everyone , but whoa .	1	1
1	so disappointed !	1	1
1	bread pudding is always warm no ?	1	1
1	it 'll never dry !	1	1
1	the service was the most appalling i have ever experienced .	1	1
1	had a hamburger wrap for meal which i did n't care for .	1	1
1	it 's not appealing at all and the eggs smell just like grease .	1	1
1	sounded like i was flying a helicopter .	1	1
1	they did not even cook it fresh .	1	1
1	i thought it was from a sloppy oil change .	1	1
1	the service pretty much sucked .	1	1
1	worst indian food i have ever eat in us .	1	1
1	have been there several times and it 's always super slow .	1	1
1	usually will give a place at least two times but not in this case .	1	1
1	just not worth it .	1	1
1	( they never responded to an email i sent shortly after the incident . )	1	1
1	our meal basically met our admittedly low expectations .	1	1
1	my room came with an awesome jacuzzi .	1	1
1	so sad .	1	1
1	i would not recommend this place to anyone .	1	1
1	after around half and hour , the transaction was finally completed .	1	1
1	this type of service is just completely unacceptable .	1	1
1	so incredibly let down by this dining experience .	1	1
1	this was the worst service and experience i have ever received !	1	1
1	i wo n't be using the credit towards future business .	1	1
1	nothing but breading .	1	1
1	i just could n't buy anything there because it was all too bloody expensive !	1	1
1	_num_ stars .	1	1
1	_num_ weeks later i am still waiting on my other shirts .	1	1
1	times , and it still is not resolved .	1	1
1	the restaurant had several empty tables .	1	1
1	the coleslaw is gross and i 'm a fan of coleslaw .	1	1
1	the chocolate was too sweet .	1	1
1	and coming to the taste it is horrible .	1	1
1	took nearly two hours for everyone in our party to get our food .	1	1
1	when we finally got the pizza , it was not hot .	1	1
1	i have never placed a bad review of a restaurant until now .	1	1
1	owner on the phone and did n't even acknowledge the customer .	1	1
1	the place smells of smoke .	1	1
1	the fried rice did n't have any vegetable in it and was so bland .	1	1
1	okay , shame on us for not asking .	1	1
1	i really did n't care for the breakfast steak biscuits .	1	1
1	the market square location has the most horrible service i 've ever experienced .	1	1
1	first , their clothing is arranged by color , not by size .	1	1
1	female manager on duty asked for $ _num_ in exchange for a pizza .	1	1
1	the walls and doors are paper thin .	1	1
1	i 'm still not convinced that this is a vegetarian restaurant .	1	1
1	run , do n't walk from this place !	1	1
1	i travel to clt fairly regular on business .	1	1
1	i have not eaten in the dinner area yet .	1	1
1	look on his face - totally rude and completely inept .	1	1
1	this was probably the worst gyro i have ever had .	1	1
1	very disappointed in this operation .	1	1
1	tsa here is horrible .	1	1
1	but , the fast part for this location has struggled for a while .	1	1
1	diner _num_ - steamed clams .	1	1
1	the waiter was very young and a bit clueless .	1	1
1	this place is terrible .	1	1
1	i wish she would help everyone that ever needs help while traveling .	1	1
1	the staff at the downtown location tend to be rude .	1	1
1	eventually , i found bland tomatoes and shredded iceberg lettuce hidden far below .	1	1
1	i visited nc and thought this place was disgusting , i sure was right !	1	1
1	i wo n't be back .	1	1
1	if i could give this place _num_ starts i would .	1	1
1	i was here once and probably wo n't be back .	1	1
1	i really should have known better to walk in here .	1	1
1	looks like very other cvs .	1	1
1	sausage was disgusting .	1	1
1	get over yourselves people .	1	1
1	my dad and i walked in around _num_ pm on a friday night .	1	1
1	i 'm sure the ending does n't get much better .	1	1
1	i said i could n't .	1	1
1	why _num_ star ?	1	1
1	it was just average and did n't really have any taste .	1	1
1	- original pretzel appetizer .	1	1
1	husband ordered penne chicken vodka sauce .	1	1
1	do yourself a favor , avoid this place .	1	1
1	terrible .	1	1
1	their most recent management change has left the place without a soul .	1	1
1	menu is pretty standard as far as hibachi grill food items goes .	1	1
1	glad we went , but we wo n't go back .	1	1
1	absolutely the worst service ( if you can call it that ) .	1	1
1	i used to order takeout here once every month or so .	1	1
1	so gross .	1	1
1	everyone else at the table hated their food .	1	1
1	greek salad was pretty good but nothing else really was .	1	1
1	that is where our connecting flight 's gate was located .	1	1
1	i called to find out what was on the hot and spicy chicken .	1	1
1	maybe my expectations were just too high , i do n't know .	1	1
1	$ _num_ corkage fee for _num_ bottle of wine .	1	1
1	i will never do any business with this jerk off ever again .	1	1
1	i 'd never had the food before .	1	1
1	terrible !	1	1
1	as a vegetarian , it was entirely another matter for me .	1	1
1	rude customer service .	1	1
1	i felt like i had wasted my hard earned money .	1	1
1	we may have waited _num_ minutes before our table was ready .	1	1
1	we were so hungry by that point , we just ate whatever we could .	1	1
1	ok food , not too exceptional .	1	1
1	easily the worst cup of coffee i 've ever had .	1	1
1	the menu was alot different than the last time we was at applebees . ]	1	1
1	they did nothing for us , not even an apology .	1	1
1	i would n't even give this place one star .	1	1
1	the toppings were in the bland category .	1	1
1	i was extremely disappointed with capital grille .	1	1
1	an average price , i 'm ok with that .	1	1
1	the photos they posted do not do this place justice .	1	1
1	most were stale .	1	1
1	worst pizza i 've had in pittsburgh .	1	1
1	there 's no pride in the service or the food at all .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	well , it was overpriced and the food was terrible .	1	1
1	just very weird .	1	1
1	sounds fancy , eh ?	1	1
1	i was ok with this and it sounded fair enough .	1	1
1	the rooms are not worth the money .	1	1
1	not friendly .	1	1
1	rude .	1	1
1	you should avoid it at any time .	1	1
1	but oh , how the standards have fallen !	1	1
1	this place is hit or miss .	1	1
1	unfortunately every time i wish i was somewhere else .	1	1
1	the doctor confirmed her prescription was accurate and the glasses were off .	1	1
1	overall , i just was n't very impressed with the food .	1	1
1	this hotel just does not feel fresh enough .	1	1
1	i ordered the french toast with the western omelette and home fries .	1	1
1	the cake di chocolate is standard lava cake ( takes forever to make ) .	1	1
1	terrible !	1	1
1	save your money and dine elsewhere .	1	1
1	the food was not great and not worth the price at all .	1	1
1	one week later it was empty again .	1	1
1	overall , the look of the store just seems to be tired .	1	1
1	just not what i had in mind .	1	1
1	( they had run out of home fries ) .	1	1
1	i 'm in bed before 8pm on most nights .	1	1
1	overall , tessaro 's fell flat and left me hung out to dry .	1	1
1	for the entree , i ordered rigatoni and my fiance had baked ziti .	1	1
1	additionally , they did not smell so well .	1	1
1	it actually hurt my eyes to look at the table it was so bright .	1	1
1	no thanks .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	musty smelling .	1	1
1	takes terribly long although i am gold member .	1	1
1	this place was a huge disappointment for me .	1	1
1	the steak is average and it 's over run by boa middle management .	1	1
1	: ( i 'll buy online before i go in here again .	1	1
1	the sauce was not a good flavor at all .	1	1
1	the garnish had cheese on it the first time , not the 2nd .	1	1
1	honestly , it 's probably the worst i 've ever had .	1	1
1	however , based on previous reviews , the food is hit or miss .	1	1
1	_num_ plate of food for our party comes out while others wait .	1	1
1	the in house internet is the slowest you will find .	1	1
1	while patrick stepped up the service the entire experience was fairly terrible .	1	1
1	the food quality was garbage she undercooked the hash browns as well .	1	1
1	this place has permanently lost my patronage .	1	1
1	avoid this place .	1	1
1	would n't they want you to stay and spend money on their property ?	1	1
1	terrible .	1	1
1	so we left never going back first and last !	1	1
1	and the customer service was horrible .	1	1
1	the cheesecake looked and tasted like it was a store bought frozen dessert .	1	1
1	last night we ordered take out and it left us disappointed .	1	1
1	the biggest problem was that the meat was under cooked .	1	1
1	i 'm not sure i 'd call them a deli .	1	1
1	not sure about the food handling practices here .	1	1
1	the installers were knowledgeable , friendly and efficient .	1	1
1	oh , i wo n't be coming back .	1	1
1	i 'd give this store negative stars if there was an option .	1	1
1	as my son said their `` legendary sweet tea '' was n't very legendary .	1	1
1	this outback is horrible .	1	1
1	i do n't see why not but there are better .	1	1
1	slow , over priced , i 'll go elsewhere next time .	1	1
1	i was wrong .	1	1
1	should be _num_ minutes '' .	1	1
1	want to sit in the bar area ?	1	1
1	first one , no dressing .	1	1
1	what happened ?	1	1
1	what reason would a restaurant serve water in a plastic cup is beyond me .	1	1
1	the lady i spoke to was rude and unprofessional .	1	1
1	( lie # _num_ ) .	1	1
1	there is limited table space in the bar in general .	1	1
1	for dinner , not that great .	1	1
1	worst airport in the area .	1	1
1	this is the 6th time i 've called them about the same issue .	1	1
1	the pizza was really really greasy .	1	1
1	the carpet has clearly not been cleaned since it was installed .	1	1
1	no thanks .	1	1
1	if you send them an email , they do n't check it .	1	1
1	service was very poor , the minute we stepped in .	1	1
1	how ridiculous for an arcade game company to turn away kids .	1	1
1	dismissive associates ... .	1	1
1	never insult someone 's children .	1	1
1	i imagine less than _num_ % of expensive restaurants today are cash only .	1	1
1	this place is popular , but it is just is not for me !	1	1
1	every appetizer and main dish is horrible .	1	1
1	the food , however , is mediocre at best .	1	1
1	truly the worst mall in america .	1	1
1	it 's not romantic , just dim .	1	1
1	i 've lived in many apartments before and this one is the worst .	1	1
1	as for the food and drink , it was just fine .	1	1
1	do not take your car to midas !	1	1
1	i was originally told it would take _num_ mins .	1	1
1	just bad .	1	1
1	what 's worse ?	1	1
1	excuse me ?	1	1
1	so frustrated .	1	1
1	over crowded , loud , and not a relaxing experience .	1	1
1	otherwise , it stinks .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	dogs also get some time to run in a huge play area outside .	1	1
1	we sat down and jim pulled out a list of what they had discussed .	1	1
1	bottom line , this place sucks .	1	1
1	not impressed .	1	1
1	water pressure in the shower was also horrible .	1	1
1	it tasted like milk and no coffee .	1	1
1	not that we would have used it , but the pool was closed .	1	1
1	my trade was only worth about half of what carmax said it was ?	1	1
1	appetizer , hot wings , were mediocre at best .	1	1
1	i can not recommend this salon .	1	1
1	in fact , i advised a friend against living here .	1	1
1	but not the place if you 're super hungry .	1	1
1	tried to call corporate and let 's just say they could care less .	1	1
1	the salad dressing was okay , but missing something .	1	1
1	i would be embarrassed to serve this !	1	1
1	if she 's the best , i would hate to see the worst .	1	1
1	the building has been recently remodeled because it burned .	1	1
1	i do not eat sushi , however my husband does .	1	1
1	avoid this place .	1	1
1	the pricing is ridiculous .	1	1
1	bad !	1	1
1	the service was terrible .	1	1
1	receptionist proceeded to tell me `` someone will call you when its ready . ''	1	1
1	ugly .	1	1
1	we were leaving to go _num_ miles away the next day for the wedding .	1	1
1	white , and very loud .	1	1
1	the steaks had no flavor and the lobster was overcooked .	1	1
1	but we never let the house get to a point of disaster .	1	1
1	hostess greeted the group quickly and was ready to seat us .	1	1
1	the thermostat must have been set at _num_ .	1	1
1	the chicken curry was passable .	1	1
1	and he had a cd setup -- seriously , cds , in _num_ .	1	1
1	it was cut so thin and had no chicken flavor .	1	1
1	all we ordered was hamburgers and chicken sandwiches .	1	1
1	i will not be going back .	1	1
1	shockingly bad .	1	1
1	either case , i 'm not thrilled .	1	1
1	too bad .	1	1
1	the cheesy jalapeno dip it was served with was good .	1	1
1	it was all bread and coleslaw .	1	1
1	these people are the worst .	1	1
1	not worth it .	1	1
1	you probably are n't either .	1	1
1	first off , our waitress just was n't good .	1	1
1	is that really too much to ask ?	1	1
1	disgusted .	1	1
1	we were seated , and had to wait awhile for service .	1	1
1	inefficient and lazy .	1	1
1	id give _num_ 1/2 stars .	1	1
1	the staff is ghetto and rude and the food was horrible .	1	1
1	the server was nice , that is not the issue .	1	1
1	sundays paper sometimes is no bigger than a big city 's week day paper .	1	1
1	i was just going to pay for it and leave .	1	1
1	avoid this place .	1	1
1	so , i ordered the chicken cheesesteak , fries and some coleslaw .	1	1
1	repeated my order _num_ times and it still got screwed up .	1	1
1	this place is terrible .	1	1
1	in fact faux wood furniture all around .	1	1
1	overall i was underwhelmed and disappointed .	1	1
1	the balsamic whatever sirloin was awful .	1	1
1	a _num_ minute wait for a draft beer on a slow night ?	1	1
1	the food is pretty forgettable .	1	1
1	my minimum tip is $ _num_ , even at the cheapest places .	1	1
1	_num_ mins later we get our refills .	1	1
1	they charge alot to have such bad customer service .	1	1
1	both were so bland i could have prepared a better version at home .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	even though we had a reservation we were made to wait for a car .	1	1
1	there were waitresses everywhere , and it seemed _num_ or _num_ managers .	1	1
1	i will likely not give them my business again .	1	1
1	my salmon was dry and flavorless with the filler rice .	1	1
1	so really it was n't a terribly difficult job to be done .	1	1
1	my daughter who picked it up had to leave .	1	1
1	ugh .	1	1
1	i was really disappointed in this place .	1	1
1	i made a change in frames less than _num_ hours from original order .	1	1
1	otherwise , probably not .	1	1
1	tonight 's offering was a step above cafeteria chicken strips .	1	1
1	oh whole foods , you are so so very overpriced .	1	1
1	next up , the `` general tso 's bean curd . ''	1	1
1	becky ordered some meat with chile sauce which came first .	1	1
1	the toast was fine but how can you really mess up toast ?	1	1
1	owner was extremely polite .	1	1
1	my husband and i stayed here as a weekend get away to charlotte .	1	1
1	ever !	1	1
1	it got cold at night .	1	1
1	not much interest in those , huh ?	1	1
1	i was sadly disappointed .	1	1
1	check your credit and debit cards after use in carowinds !	1	1
1	when i questioned the cashier she did n't apologize or anything .	1	1
1	we went here with family to have lunch , the service was ok .	1	1
1	unbelievable .	1	1
1	it really is just a bar with bad bar food .	1	1
1	yelpers , you let me down !	1	1
1	they staff is friendly enough , but they are still a service biased company .	1	1
1	trying cajun yard dog next .	1	1
1	horrible experience and expensive .	1	1
1	on top of all this the location is horrible .	1	1
1	so after explaining the situation they lower the price to $ _num_ .	1	1
1	neither of us were impressed .	1	1
1	it should n't have take an hour to do it anyway .	1	1
1	i do n't like a sandwich with more mayo than meat , either .	1	1
1	better deals and better food at a mall food court .	1	1
1	a friendly restaurant employee is the exception to the rule at cajun queen .	1	1
1	i 'm not entirely sure what the fuss about bojangles is .	1	1
1	it is n't worth it and is n't typical for the south .	1	1
1	slow , unfriendly staff who refuse to even talk to you sometimes !	1	1
1	mussels were freezing cold .	1	1
1	cod , very dry and still had bones in it .	1	1
1	i guess in ten years no new games have hit the scene .	1	1
1	d & d is expensive .	1	1
1	was told it would n't be long .	1	1
1	i just gave up .	1	1
1	they do n't even have a restroom for customers !	1	1
1	hot and sour soup also bland .	1	1
1	it continued for two hours .	1	1
1	they do n't provide it because they do n't want you to find them .	1	1
1	poor customer service .	1	1
1	for my third tattoo , i decided i wanted to go to fu 's .	1	1
1	mashed potatoes was my only choice .	1	1
1	no host and the bartender asked if we were going to eat .	1	1
1	after she was treated properly , she healed quickly .	1	1
1	imagine my frustration .	1	1
1	i have mixed feelings about rock bottom .	1	1
1	not as good as i used to come before .	1	1
1	!	1	1
1	no service once there .	1	1
1	i am in boston , not charlotte .	1	1
1	i would n't bother to order it again .	1	1
1	wish hertz was more understanding .	1	1
1	i felt bad just ordering free beer so i ordered a sandwich .	1	1
1	no bueno and no thank you !	1	1
1	the only flying you should be doing here is flying right past the place .	1	1
1	we will not be back .	1	1
1	she stated that she would go ask to see if something could be done .	1	1
1	the sandwich sucked ; no flavor , no excitement .	1	1
1	the fish sandwich arrived nearly _num_ minutes before the rest of our meals .	1	1
1	no taste at all .	1	1
1	my ravioli was barely cooked .	1	1
1	i really was sold at one point .	1	1
1	the service is really bad .	1	1
1	who serves a drink without ice ?	1	1
1	terrible experience here .	1	1
1	there 's never any reason to be rude to your patrons .	1	1
1	however , this place does have burgers and other menu items .	1	1
1	ie skinny burgers with simple ingredients ( ie american cheese and ketchup ) .	1	1
1	smoke bomb disappeared !	1	1
1	we ca n't wait till our lease is up !	1	1
1	they damaged my car .	1	1
1	terrible !	1	1
1	service was slow and the restaurant was not crowded .	1	1
1	no bugs yet .	1	1
1	which is just weird in a restaurant setting .	1	1
1	this place does n't do it for me at all .	1	1
1	there were no pictures hung in the room to improve the appearance .	1	1
1	i am calling the gm !	1	1
1	the restaurant is the worst .	1	1
1	the noodles were not good either .	1	1
1	the mac n cheese and pound cake was ok at best .	1	1
1	biggest mistake i ever made !	1	1
1	my biggest problem was the service .	1	1
1	long waits and lack of attentiveness .	1	1
1	this place has really fallen off .	1	1
1	bland .	1	1
1	nothing positive to say other than do n't go there .	1	1
1	all i could taste was the overwhelming chemical , fake garlic flavor .	1	1
1	please do not buy fish from this store they will rip you off .	1	1
1	they have decent drink specials .	1	1
1	i will not be returning .	1	1
1	i was not impressed by anything here .	1	1
1	ordered crab cakes , they were dry and the crab tasted old as well .	1	1
1	the hotel staff itself was n't very welcoming .	1	1
1	i only give it _num_ stars because of the wait staff !	1	1
1	unfortunately , we were all pretty underwhelmed with most of the dinner .	1	1
1	under no circumstances would i eat here again .	1	1
1	do not shop here , it 's not worth the risk .	1	1
1	the meat was very dry and falling apart but not over cooked .	1	1
1	original post written september _num_ - i do n't recommend this company .	1	1
1	after today , i will never be back .	1	1
1	i did n't feel the manager was apologetic although she had comped our meal .	1	1
1	confusing , and a pain .	1	1
1	)	1	1
1	no quick and easy app or beers on the house .	1	1
1	side note ... .	1	1
1	nasty hotel !	1	1
1	this is by far the worst airport ever .	1	1
1	i threw the whole meal in the garbage .	1	1
1	will admit beverage glasses were kept full , but nor a single pleasant gesture .	1	1
1	not fair to the customer at all .	1	1
1	it more than less ruined our dining experience .	1	1
1	inconsistent billing , poor customer service , and lies sum up this service .	1	1
1	needless to say , i will never return to this restaurant .	1	1
1	ugh worst serves ever !	1	1
1	most places charge _num_ to _num_ dollars .	1	1
1	i liked the salad , but it was nothing special .	1	1
1	i do n't know why all the hype on this place .	1	1
1	i will not be returning .	1	1
1	i thought the selection on the menu was pretty poor .	1	1
1	and the gym was okay but nothing special .	1	1
1	do n't waste your money or time here .	1	1
1	i was n't impressed with this place .	1	1
1	at this point i was angry .	1	1
1	the food and drinks are very over priced for what it is .	1	1
1	there is no excuse .	1	1
1	but the quality just does n't match the price .	1	1
1	first off , i like family restaurants and avoid chains when possible .	1	1
1	it was ok ... very mediocre .	1	1
1	sorry buca , a previous visit was much better than this one .	1	1
1	the outside breading was hard as a rock and had no taste .	1	1
1	not a fan of this airport .	1	1
1	the restaurant was worse for breakfast .	1	1
1	flash forward to now , the tasty grilled portobello sandwich is gone .	1	1
1	too busy with your iphone ?	1	1
1	the collards were authentic and would get them again .	1	1
1	the chili was tasteless .	1	1
1	i 'd adventure elsewhere to indian if i were you .	1	1
1	i got _num_ dozen donuts , and it was $ _num_ !	1	1
1	for the price this is a _num_ star .	1	1
1	so do n't take my word .	1	1
1	however it wasnt until half way through my appointment that i got it .	1	1
1	do n't come to hertz .	1	1
1	it was not enjoyable .	1	1
1	our drink order was also forgotten .	1	1
1	that sucks .	1	1
1	our server jeff was the worst waitstaff i 've encountered in many years .	1	1
1	gross .	1	1
1	only one person even bothered to take home their leftovers .	1	1
1	sorry buds !	1	1
1	his key does not work either .	1	1
1	no dice .	1	1
1	a couple tables taken , but no sign of staff in the bar .	1	1
1	i was very unimpressed .	1	1
1	also notice that the chicken she had ate was undercooked .	1	1
1	i would n't even feed this food to my dog .	1	1
1	neither i nor my husband understood the hype about this place .	1	1
1	the whole experience can be both amusing and depressing at the same time .	1	1
1	the worst apartment i 've ever lived in !	1	1
1	food was awful .	1	1
1	if i could give negative stars i certainly would for this place .	1	1
1	avoid at all cost .	1	1
1	downstairs tables are too close .	1	1
1	poor crowd control .	1	1
1	it was fine to eat i guess , just not a chicken parm .	1	1
1	no one ate their entire meal .	1	1
1	we got up and walked out and will never be back .	1	1
1	my husband had a little better luck with his than i did .	1	1
1	this is a waste of time and money .	1	1
1	he slept on the sofa both nights .	1	1
1	i sent all the food back shortly into the meal because it was cold .	1	1
1	i never seen such a rude person in this county so far .	1	1
1	this is the worst westin i 've ever stayed in .	1	1
1	i dread it at this point .	1	1
1	a voice from downstairs says `` i 'm down here . ''	1	1
1	the service on the other hand was not .	1	1
1	i guess that is really the only thing this place has going for it .	1	1
1	life is too short for less than mediocre food .	1	1
1	what a complete waste of time .	1	1
1	poor quality work .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	service is slow and the food is not good at all .	1	1
1	_num_ up ?	1	1
1	service was extremely slow .	1	1
1	i could barely eat the salad .	1	1
1	she did not even follow through on that promise .	1	1
1	$ _num_ a glass of garbage wine ?	1	1
1	to be smooth after only one pedicure . ''	1	1
1	this is why i chose them to begin with as stated about .	1	1
1	caesar salad should not be too spicy to eat .	1	1
1	to use up a groupon , we had dinner there last night .	1	1
1	it tasted more steamed than hot grilled .	1	1
1	this is a trash and security problem .	1	1
1	calling corporate offices to complain about this place ... its beyond unacceptable .	1	1
1	floor was sticky .	1	1
1	overall , _num_ stars .	1	1
1	they sit on tables and often just sit at your table .	1	1
1	but later the service was not all good .	1	1
1	let 's add up those dollars , shall we , time warner ?	1	1
1	maybe it 's because people have never had real cajun cuisine before .	1	1
1	does chicken salad hold a week in your fridge ?	1	1
1	the most ghetto ran wendy 's i have ever been to .	1	1
1	my sandwich was dripping with sauce and had everything on it !	1	1
1	ordered _num_ cuts to eat in and _num_ and a hoagie to go ... .	1	1
1	potatoes or pasta are always included with marsala .	1	1
1	no one should have to go thru what i am currently going thru .	1	1
1	the fries were horrible .	1	1
1	water glass was refilled promptly the one time it was starting to look empty .	1	1
1	there was the powder parmesan on the table which i added myself .	1	1
1	so , i just asked her , what do you have .	1	1
1	nothing authentic about this place , will definitely not be going back !	1	1
1	i arrived and was disappointed to not see the arrangement i ordered .	1	1
1	the garlic beef was cold and the meat was very fatty .	1	1
1	very bad service .	1	1
1	i guess for $ _num_ i could n't complain .	1	1
1	couple of years ago more orders were found to be overcooked and less meaty .	1	1
1	the french fries are ok , i guess .	1	1
1	very disappointing and frustrating .	1	1
1	poor service .	1	1
1	the batter had no taste , as well as the sauce .	1	1
1	bland and overcooked .	1	1
1	half ass job for more money than i 'm used to spending .	1	1
1	busy is not an excuse for under cooked food .	1	1
1	but i was also delivered some super soggy crab rangoon .	1	1
1	the head massage was painful and rough .	1	1
1	i called back at 10am instead .	1	1
1	unbelievably disappointed .	1	1
1	i would recommend others to check the price when you drop off your clothes .	1	1
1	food was fine , wo n't go back for fear of the server .	1	1
1	some of us would actually like to get home to our families .	1	1
1	i was totally underwhelmed .	1	1
1	i ordered fried chicken , greens , yams , catfish , and banana pudding .	1	1
1	i asked if he is a doctor and she replied , `` no .	1	1
1	but , it is what it is so do not forget your key !	1	1
1	bad idea .	1	1
1	the lasagna and spaghetti is very generic .	1	1
1	she claimed they did n't deliver to his address which was _num_ mile away .	1	1
1	i want to give this place no stars but it 's not an option .	1	1
1	i called ahead to order a gyro calzone and was told _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	why would you not just get our drinks ?	1	1
1	i probably would have complained , but we decided instead to pay and leave .	1	1
1	it was like a window into hell .	1	1
1	and i said , my car requires a synthetic blend .	1	1
1	i only ate the shrimp .	1	1
1	that 's sad .	1	1
1	it was $ _num_ after tax .	1	1
1	wo n't go back or recommend it .	1	1
1	in fact , it is barely even memorable .	1	1
1	it is jessica fault !	1	1
1	this is what some would refer to as , terrible and heavy .	1	1
1	she offered me two different stylists by name with no other information .	1	1
1	very rude and unacceptable .	1	1
1	yes , i wrote a letter , i 'm that guy .	1	1
1	horrible !	1	1
1	but i did n't have a problem with that .	1	1
1	the worst service and pizza .	1	1
1	awful awful awful !	1	1
1	the return policy is horrible !	1	1
1	but overall i wo n't be getting food here again .	1	1
1	the fries were cooked to perfection , but lacked flavor .	1	1
1	no one ever knows what they are talking about and problems are never resolved .	1	1
1	the restaurant was completely empty .	1	1
1	but the bed was a big disappointment .	1	1
1	i would n't recommend eating here , and i certainly wo n't be returning .	1	1
1	hands down , this was the worst we 've ever had .	1	1
1	i had to wait _num_ min in the drive thru for a supreme combo .	1	1
1	do not go to this restaurant !	1	1
1	i was quite disappointed .	1	1
1	if you ca n't do bother signing up for it .	1	1
1	they might have to teach their cooks how to cook a steak .	1	1
1	she served us our drinks then immediately left for another table .	1	1
1	i drove for like _num_ miles .	1	1
1	i would definitely not take your family .	1	1
1	- i did n't say anything because my relatives have friends who work there .	1	1
1	not the best dinner they have eaten .	1	1
1	the food was bad , yo .	1	1
1	not so much here .	1	1
1	this is n't the first time this happened .	1	1
1	they are understaffed , incompetent , and slow .	1	1
1	horrible treatment .	1	1
1	that is $ _num_ month from august to march .	1	1
1	i ca n't even begin to tell you how they treated me !	1	1
1	worst pilot ever !	1	1
1	the restaurant was probably half full of people .	1	1
1	i was quoted $ _num_ for them to get it off .	1	1
1	they have offered $ _num_ a shirt for the shirts they lost .	1	1
1	vegetables limp and overlooked .	1	1
1	desert area of buffet was never stocked and was dirty .	1	1
1	i 'm not sure what was worse food or service .	1	1
1	then , they did n't even do anything to make it up to me .	1	1
1	horrible service .	1	1
1	ordered a glass of wine and beers for my companions .	1	1
1	probably the worst mother 's day brunch in charlotte .	1	1
1	is n't that the same as `` not made fresh in pittsburgh ? ''	1	1
1	rude employees .	1	1
1	the place seemed pretty busy with about _num_ % of the stalls occupied .	1	1
1	a little crowded but took an hour and came out wrong .	1	1
1	went back and changed and got another smokers room .	1	1
1	up to ~ $ _num_ ) .	1	1
1	the lox bagels are not even made open face .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	compared to other restaurants this is my least favorite .	1	1
1	delivery guy was shady too .	1	1
1	do n't stay here .	1	1
1	i ordered the turkey blt with lemon aioli and arugula salad .	1	1
1	he then was really rude and never gave us napkins or forks .	1	1
1	very dim lighting somewhere between romantic and creepy .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	after a few phone calls later , no shirts , no suits .	1	1
1	just a bit uncomfortable to see how much someone spent on an engagement ring !	1	1
1	unfortunately , my head is sometimes up my own behind .	1	1
1	made a one night stay $ _num_ .	1	1
1	i did not check the bathrooms , too scared to try .	1	1
1	terrible service .	1	1
1	when we did finally get our food , it was ice cold .	1	1
1	will remove this restaurant from our list of places to go .	1	1
1	this was somewhat disturbing seeing as they are constantly touching dirty plates and towels .	1	1
1	major disappointment as that stuff is the highlight of a hibachi visit !	1	1
1	restrooms are always dirty at every visit i 've been there .	1	1
1	really disappointed .	1	1
1	lo and behold , twenty minutes later , they called us back over .	1	1
1	the beef turns out to be $ _num_ .	1	1
1	wo n't be going back .	1	1
1	the first time i rented from this location the rep was not very polite .	1	1
1	not bad but i have better in the strip .	1	1
1	extremely slow service !	1	1
1	i would definitely not recommend this place to anyone , even my worst enemy .	1	1
1	imitation crab & lots of filling .	1	1
1	the downtown office has ruined america 's best for me forever .	1	1
1	who the hell can sleep on a square like that besides a child !	1	1
1	unfortunately yelp asked to provide more details on review .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	terrible business .	1	1
1	the service has been poor almost every time i went .	1	1
1	but the biscuits just do n't cut it for me to try them again .	1	1
1	all in all , this place just needs a bit of organization .	1	1
1	i wo n't be heading back .	1	1
1	i wish i could give this place no stars !	1	1
1	mama ricotta will be a better option .	1	1
1	music was awful last saturday .	1	1
1	i did not finish my meal and got up and paid and left .	1	1
1	the place was near empty and there were three waitresses .	1	1
1	maybe if i come back next time i 'll have better luck ?	1	1
1	an expensive hassle for such terrible service .	1	1
1	the mussels were barely seasoned and were hardly edible .	1	1
1	target reminds me of hills when i was a kid .	1	1
1	it 's the size of a closet , completely messy , and disorganized .	1	1
1	i really did n't want come back here though .	1	1
1	went here with a coupon , otherwise would have definitely not been worth it .	1	1
1	way too expensive if you ask me .	1	1
1	bottom line : not terrible , but very underwhelmed by the coffee and service .	1	1
1	i called garden ridge to speak to a customer service rep .	1	1
1	very low quality food for the price .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	so you ask why _num_ stars , simple it was location location .	1	1
1	the japanese food here is nasty compare to other places in charlotte .	1	1
1	to say that the dessert selection was uninspired is a severe understatement .	1	1
1	it was also very greasy and watery , and tasted extremely bland .	1	1
1	truly , you do n't need this kind of grief .	1	1
1	very cold to watch a game in even buy usual local rink standards .	1	1
1	not a fan of this location .	1	1
1	it 's clear that they do not care at all .	1	1
1	ultimately , there was confusion about who was responsible for our table .	1	1
1	use the internet or drive over to matthews and go to fire power .	1	1
1	needless to say i have n't been back but would recommend in a jam .	1	1
1	i 'm embarrassed to be writing this review .	1	1
1	the chicken was also extremely dry .	1	1
1	i tried a bite of it .	1	1
1	still waiting on more phone calls to be returned .	1	1
1	the spaghetti and mussels were pretty good though .	1	1
1	i have never experienced that in any restaurant before .	1	1
1	this is nothing new .	1	1
1	this was a disappointment .	1	1
1	do not recommend .	1	1
1	i ate a few bites and tossed most of it in the trash .	1	1
1	gross much ?	1	1
1	you will be disappointed .	1	1
1	this marriott would not be a good property for a long stay .	1	1
1	second , the lady at the counter is extremely rude and unpleasant .	1	1
1	poor quality service and professionalism across the board .	1	1
1	neither of us were surprised .	1	1
1	the corn lacked butter .	1	1
1	so i dropped it off for a week .	1	1
1	oh , and the lunch special pricing is not bad at all .	1	1
1	there is no option for zero stars so i was forced to give one .	1	1
1	terrible .	1	1
1	i paid $ _num_ to add sauted mushrooms , onions , and cheese .	1	1
1	long story short , what was advertised online looked nothing like what we received .	1	1
1	maybe _num_ % full !	1	1
1	they offered a lifetime warranty , so no future issue would be a problem .	1	1
1	i made a very simple order online -- very difficult to screw up .	1	1
1	estimated delivery time _num_ minutes actually delivery time _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	just this last episode that has to deal with an inspection has me annoyed !	1	1
1	gone downhill .	1	1
1	ick !	1	1
1	( _num_ minutes of this ) .	1	1
1	not going back .	1	1
1	you also used pay phones because you did n't have a cell phone .	1	1
1	i never told them about the cockroach because they did n't deserve to know .	1	1
1	they were burnt and cooked down to nothing .	1	1
1	extremely disappointed , food was absolutely awful .	1	1
1	the spicy yellow tail was not spicy .	1	1
1	i will never spend another dime here .	1	1
1	such a waste of time and rude .	1	1
1	sadly , my croissant was none of these things .	1	1
1	the salad had way too much iceberg lettuce and tasted like crap .	1	1
1	we was disappointed of the food and service .	1	1
1	none of the machines seemed to work properly at all .	1	1
1	it was a tired person 's worst nightmare .	1	1
1	if you are in the aaa , you 'll know i 'm calling .	1	1
1	poor service , screwed up orders .	1	1
1	the beds were uncomfortable .	1	1
1	i was wrong .	1	1
1	the dress comes in _num_ months later and is the wrong color .	1	1
1	first and far most people , i never write a bad review .	1	1
1	a number of the reviews here giving off the `` eh '' vibe ?	1	1
1	lazy workers , all rude and incompetent .	1	1
1	menu says `` soup '' , no particular type .	1	1
1	sorry but not going back there again .	1	1
1	i used to love this place , but the service is horrible now .	1	1
1	we only wish we would have ordered food and then left .	1	1
1	and cheese sauce that you get for your nachos at the gas station .	1	1
1	but they sure sold it to me .	1	1
1	the pizza was n't terrible but it certainly was n't good in my opinion .	1	1
1	our meal did n't arrive to our table until _num_ 1/2 hours after ordering .	1	1
1	food was bland and tasteless and she never bothered to fill our drinks .	1	1
1	the place was pretty dead and we were seated right away .	1	1
1	no big deal , right ?	1	1
1	sadly , both experiences were less than stellar .	1	1
1	should n't be too hard of a task , yeah ?	1	1
1	bad food , slow service and rude managers .	1	1
1	i am definitely not going back to complete the transaction .	1	1
1	it 's so crammed and so messy .	1	1
1	skip it .	1	1
1	no professionalism .	1	1
1	do n't bother to stop .	1	1
1	my stomach had turned at this point so i said `` no . ''	1	1
1	not worth it .	1	1
1	not as crispy as others stated and they needed salt !	1	1
1	i did n't eat them all because they got cold and kind of gross .	1	1
1	the salesperson walked away and proceed to start helping other customers .	1	1
1	either way , i wo n't be coming back .	1	1
1	the fries were good and the burger was as i ordered .	1	1
1	however , the service is seriously lacking .	1	1
1	i 've had good meals here , and i 've had really bad ones .	1	1
1	their foods are not that tasteful .	1	1
1	this is the worst place i 've maybe ever been to .	1	1
1	avoid this location if you can .	1	1
1	i grabbed my daughter by the arm and led her out of there .	1	1
1	it was an expensive craft beer .	1	1
1	service is not friendly .	1	1
1	they were also extremely greasy and had zero flavor of any kind of sauce .	1	1
1	crab rangoon was terrible .	1	1
1	it 's frustrating because they also do n't particularly need to work hard .	1	1
1	clean rooms .	1	1
1	typical auto repair shop trying to steal money especially from young women .	1	1
1	service was friendly , but slow .	1	1
1	completely worthless wifi .	1	1
1	avoid !	1	1
1	i made zero errors .	1	1
1	no bueno .	1	1
1	overall , i was not impressed with the food but liked the people .	1	1
1	we have had vietnamese food in other states before but here is the worst .	1	1
1	it 's all about curries , rice , naan and spices .	1	1
1	very rude service was in line for ten mins .	1	1
1	you 're better off going in to speak to someone face to face .	1	1
1	my moo shu chicken was mostly cabbage .	1	1
1	pasta trio was bizarre .	1	1
1	the airport environment feels very rushed and stressful .	1	1
1	would n't recommend .	1	1
1	painfully blah , older business hotel that needs updates and upgrades .	1	1
1	i just remembered why i do n't visit chain sit down restaurants .	1	1
1	as noted by other posters the waitress was the bartender .	1	1
1	very disappointed .	1	1
1	do n't get me wrong there are other bad and good companies .	1	1
1	i tried the pasta once and it was tasteless .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	big disappointment was received .	1	1
1	every time , the hotdogs ( and brats ) are harder than a rock .	1	1
1	avoid this disaster .	1	1
1	if anyone had asked , i would have shared these comments .	1	1
1	the omelet was uninspired .	1	1
1	my co-worker 's chicken was n't cooked right .	1	1
1	poor experience at pick up .	1	1
1	just the worst customer service i have ever experienced .	1	1
1	and i mean all day .	1	1
1	beyond that our waitress was rude .	1	1
1	the other staff were horrible !	1	1
1	the food was mediocre at best .	1	1
1	did n't feel respected as a customer .	1	1
1	it was probably the least delicious hibachi i have ever been to .	1	1
1	do n't recommend .	1	1
1	waiter was loud and too casual .	1	1
1	it took _num_ minutes to get our server to take our dinner order .	1	1
1	the person that seated us was curt and unfriendly .	1	1
1	will not be returning .	1	1
1	they have new and used books , all separated into their various sections .	1	1
1	it then took quite awhile for our dinners to start arriving .	1	1
1	i understand that everyone has bad days .	1	1
1	sorry storm , you need to improve this .	1	1
1	hopefully i get a better experience next time .	1	1
1	the cheap part is always standard .	1	1
1	it 's sad .	1	1
1	a little pricey but whatever .	1	1
1	gross !	1	1
1	the lava cakes were barely cooked and therefore inedible .	1	1
1	was pleasantly greeted on the phone and my order was taken down promptly .	1	1
1	shame on me .	1	1
1	i been here before then said you can sit down now .	1	1
1	probably why ... carlos the manager is cheap and not customer friendly !	1	1
1	otherwise , you are better off skipping it .	1	1
1	do not sit by the windows because it was very cold .	1	1
1	i got back to my office and the bagel was not toasted .	1	1
1	then staff tried to get in !	1	1
1	but , this evening was an utter disappointment .	1	1
1	not sure we will be back .	1	1
1	i 've already taken the meal off . ''	1	1
1	it 's a shame .	1	1
1	i really wish i could rate the complex individually .	1	1
1	our garlic bread came out literally black .	1	1
1	i will not go back until they clean up the place .	1	1
1	no ketchup ?	1	1
1	the pizza was horrible !	1	1
1	the dust does n't end there .	1	1
1	not worth your money !	1	1
1	i attended the sushi class on monday night .	1	1
1	not hot and sorta greasy .	1	1
1	it 's nothing really special .	1	1
1	it gets worse but will leave this review as is .	1	1
1	the bed was dirty too .	1	1
1	visiting charlotte from los angeles while husband is in town for business .	1	1
1	i guess they want big portions to make up for poor quality .	1	1
1	service was attentive , but everything seemed to go wrong .	1	1
1	he said , oh about $ _num_ or $ _num_ .	1	1
1	based on my experience , i wo n't be returning anytime soon .	1	1
1	he knew he had issues , bad people and a huge problem .	1	1
1	certainly will not return to quick wok .	1	1
1	she had no response and again told us we were essentially out of luck .	1	1
1	shame on you north carolina for encouraging a hostile environment .	1	1
1	his poor management skills and rude behavior ruined our holiday .	1	1
1	the last visit last night was the third strike and sw is out !	1	1
1	slow service , horrible , horrible food .	1	1
1	this airport is kind of crappy and old in general .	1	1
1	i 'm a young african american woman on my way back to chicago .	1	1
1	they also lose things , more than once .	1	1
1	i do n't pay such a high price for ambiance .	1	1
1	right off the bat she said `` no . ''	1	1
1	i can never find a seat and no one ever leaves .	1	1
1	crappy hostess for sure .	1	1
1	no additional fans , nothing .	1	1
1	slow .	1	1
1	i wish they did n't put fried batter all over it though .	1	1
1	it does nothing to support the brand of lidia .	1	1
1	they 're cheap in the fries .	1	1
1	huge mistake .	1	1
1	recently renovated but my room was not completed and ac did not function properly .	1	1
1	i 'm thinking we 've struck out .	1	1
1	they sprayed the windows but obviously allowed them to air dry .	1	1
1	probably wo n't be back .	1	1
1	despite pointing out the problem , she never did do anything about that .	1	1
1	this place is usually a fave but the recently its been not so good .	1	1
1	its ridiculous and the policy needs to be changed asap .	1	1
1	please do not waste your time , gas or money .	1	1
1	also they do not take credit or debit cards .	1	1
1	i felt terrible for her in that situation .	1	1
1	managed very poorly .	1	1
1	very disappointed .	1	1
1	the pizza is what you expect , nothing better than ok .	1	1
1	by the time i had some , it was cold , chewy and blah .	1	1
1	the waiter was not nice at all !	1	1
1	lots of places to spend money !	1	1
1	overpriced low quality hibachi .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	was n't the best experience .	1	1
1	imitation crab meat at an italian restaurant does n't fly .	1	1
1	however , i can order a salad with french fries on it .	1	1
1	i had the walnut crusted salmon sandwich and jordan had the reuben .	1	1
1	it was also an outrageous $ _num_ dollars .	1	1
1	our entrees arrived about _num_ minutes after the salad .	1	1
1	they did n't remake anything .	1	1
1	the food is cheap .	1	1
1	they even gave me a hard time about making a new order .	1	1
1	they probably wo n't get my business again !	1	1
1	i 've never had pecan pie like this texture before .	1	1
1	we still had not gotten any drinks and not placed an order .	1	1
1	unfortunately the food was far from impressive .	1	1
1	had to watch my step or else i would 've stepped on someone .	1	1
1	it was annoying fighting the crowds to look at the certain cars .	1	1
1	our waitress was very rude and did n't make me feel welcomed at all .	1	1
1	tried a different chinese restaurant in the area and wish i did not .	1	1
1	ugh .	1	1
1	it blew my crappy tacos out of the water !	1	1
1	this place charges $ _num_ for _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	not one said let me find who your server is .	1	1
1	this was a horrible experience .	1	1
1	the wait was over _num_ minutes and the waiter was next to the worst .	1	1
1	do n't bother asking for management .	1	1
1	rude .	1	1
1	expansive menu from italian to greek , even mexican !	1	1
1	i gave them all my contacts information to reach me .	1	1
1	not a big fan .	1	1
1	will not be returning .	1	1
1	i felt extremely uncomfortable there , and the buffet was not worth its price .	1	1
1	you can tell that the place is wiped down but never deep cleaned .	1	1
1	the place was not even that busy .	1	1
1	very annoyed with this place .	1	1
1	he apologized and asked me to come back as he was gone .	1	1
1	wo n't be visiting there again .	1	1
1	wo n't be back .	1	1
1	not bad , a little tasteless , but why bother ?	1	1
1	the food is bland , bland bland .	1	1
1	i am sorry to be writing this review .	1	1
1	issue # _num_ : i ordered the chicken parm sub with fries .	1	1
1	the potato skins used a really cheap artificial cheese that was not very appealing .	1	1
1	the beer selection is n't that great and the upstairs bar is not full .	1	1
1	that is n't enough to make us love the place though .	1	1
1	was very disappointed with the food .	1	1
1	barely reheated naan .	1	1
1	first off , service was horrible .	1	1
1	it kind of set me off for the rest of the meal .	1	1
1	i will be filing a bbb complaint as well against this terrible management company !	1	1
1	the french toast tapas was mediocre .	1	1
1	i gave it twice and no one bothered to contact me .	1	1
1	they kill more pets for space than any other pittsburgh shelter .	1	1
1	i wish i could give it more stars , but really it was disappointing .	1	1
1	first thing i realized is that there 's no bathroom in the room .	1	1
1	the service here is horrible !	1	1
1	the low point lately has been the food .	1	1
1	i do n't remember it being this bad .	1	1
1	the food was terrible & the cooks need to get it together .	1	1
1	+ _num_ star because they are finally installing air conditioning .	1	1
1	me : `` please may i just have my beer ? ''	1	1
1	the mashed potatoes were lukewarm at best , and the vegetables were cold .	1	1
1	it tasted like hot chocolate .	1	1
1	the food is n't fresh .	1	1
1	that 's not how it 's done in philly .	1	1
1	worst service i have ever had .	1	1
1	i have been riding the bus for as long as i can remember .	1	1
1	that does n't excuse poor service and a `` screw you '' attitude .	1	1
1	bland and soggy as we 've ever tasted .	1	1
1	what i found most annoying was the uncomfortable seating .	1	1
1	it was a bucket of dry pasta with some cheese and meat .	1	1
1	service was mediocre but the food was poor .	1	1
1	i ordered some turkey wrap with a fruit salad for a side .	1	1
1	the service was soooooo slow that night .	1	1
1	the paper tickets are so _num_ 's .	1	1
1	she told me it would be awhile .	1	1
1	but going here is always such a nightmare .	1	1
1	only had the nachos , which were n't anything special .	1	1
1	but , hey , i can always catch up on my sleep tomorrow night .	1	1
1	but it was not happening at this place !	1	1
1	never again will i rent from this hertz .	1	1
1	my companion had the salmon and said it was unremarkable .	1	1
1	the last two times i have been there were not good .	1	1
1	i have this place one star , because it ca n't get any lower .	1	1
1	horrible service .	1	1
1	some of the staff has been friendly in providing things , including shuttle rides .	1	1
1	terrible way to start my vacation !	1	1
1	we tried going early , late -- it never made any difference .	1	1
1	this was one of the most disappointing food experiences i 've had in pittsburgh .	1	1
1	they can keep the other groupon .	1	1
1	also , do n't waste your time with the wifi .	1	1
1	there is an ok number of beers on tap .	1	1
1	potato salad was also old tasting and could not eat .	1	1
1	_num_ beer per hour maximum .	1	1
1	the flavorless meat drowned in sauce is not acceptable for any real barbecue lover .	1	1
1	the queso dip was cold & thick .	1	1
1	there are a few of them and there 's really nowhere else to go .	1	1
1	the stuffed shrimp was way too salty and a little fishy .	1	1
1	_num_ different family events and all _num_ were screwed up .	1	1
1	this place is terrible .	1	1
1	both times it failed on a defective license bulb .	1	1
1	the last time i finally got pizza delivered it took over _num_ hours .	1	1
1	this last experience was by far the most disappointing .	1	1
1	leftovers are in my future .	1	1
1	this was a bad experience from the start .	1	1
1	it was dry and well done plus it was small for the price .	1	1
1	they also use poor quality cheeses that had little flavor .	1	1
1	average pittsburgh pizza and fried stuff pile , nothing special though .	1	1
1	there 's zero ambiance , offers quick take-out and the service is rude .	1	1
1	the final insult : the grits .	1	1
1	the kicker is that this was n't the first time this has happened .	1	1
1	the worst part was checking out .	1	1
1	i went with a `` lunch '' sized portion of sliced smoked turkey breast .	1	1
1	look , stop being cheap .	1	1
1	had no clue what i was talking about .	1	1
1	this place is overrated .	1	1
1	... hey , how about you just lower your frickin ' prices ?	1	1
1	i feel like i 'm in line for a bad carnival ride !	1	1
1	do n't get me wrong folks .	1	1
1	place was a little bit of a disaster .	1	1
1	there were only two other customers in the entire restaurant .	1	1
1	also , the toppings were not greatly blended , just rather sprinkled .	1	1
1	fish market needs some lessons on hospitality and diversity or new management .	1	1
1	which i really did n't since they were all mediocre with little flavor .	1	1
1	false advertisement .	1	1
1	this place sucks big time as far as cleanliness and order .	1	1
1	the first thing i ordered was a bowl of lemongrass soup .	1	1
1	i would not suggest bringing a baby here .	1	1
1	terrible , bland chinese food .	1	1
1	staff is n't polite or even nice for that matter .	1	1
1	i have spent thousands of dollars at this store .	1	1
1	i really thought they were much better than this .	1	1
1	do n't get me wrong , i wanted to like this place .	1	1
1	this was done _num_ years ago .	1	1
1	but if you 're in the neighborhood , stop by for a meal .	1	1
1	is it me or does the customer service suck ?	1	1
1	i did n't hear from them at all which is so annoying .	1	1
1	they are there for the money not to reply cater to the customer .	1	1
1	Neutral	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	i 've had bad experiences here a few times now .	1	1
1	nothing special to note about this location of the papa john 's chain .	1	1
1	service was horrible .	1	1
1	very comparable to have an entree and _num_ sides .	1	1
1	the cashiers , pharmacy , and customer service manager were so rude and stupid .	1	1
1	not worth the price .	1	1
1	i could not use the pay at the pump feature with a credit card .	1	1
1	if i could give this zero stars , i would .	1	1
1	could n't get to the bar .	1	1
1	i do n't think the price worth the food .	1	1
1	the ricotta was dumped on top and added nothing to the dish .	1	1
1	that waitress says sure she 's the lady over there in the red shirt .	1	1
1	pointed out the problem and asked them if they would eat something like that .	1	1
1	there were three in our party that waited for nearly _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	not worth one star !	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	thank goodness we did n't have to use the bathrooms , beyond sketchy !	1	1
1	should have only paid per ride .	1	1
1	i just did n't want to create a scene in front of my guest .	1	1
1	even complaining to management does n't do any good .	1	1
1	i just do n't even know what to say .	1	1
1	i would n't step foot in that hot tub ever again .	1	1
1	this is the worst chinese restaurant that i have ever eaten at .	1	1
1	the car did n't have any problem .	1	1
1	it had huge chunks of tomatoes , sausage , and cheese .	1	1
1	our waiter was awful .	1	1
1	all the waitresses know me and stop by and talk .	1	1
1	i wish i could remember the other thing , but it was better .	1	1
1	when we walked in , it was like we were in the south pacific .	1	1
1	i 've eaten at various mcdonalds restaurants for over _num_ years .	1	1
1	absolutely the worst bar i 've been to .	1	1
1	the potatoes were also undercooked with not much flavor in the dish overall .	1	1
1	very poor customer service at this location .	1	1
1	thanks but no thanks .	1	1
1	frankly ( haha ) , it did n't do anything for me .	1	1
1	it was dark and crowded ( and a little bit dingy ) .	1	1
1	somebody just does n't give a **** !	1	1
1	this place is super gross it 's like eating inside the public toilet .	1	1
1	baked beans were from the can .	1	1
1	i 'm just now checking my luggage , and i have stuff missing .	1	1
1	that is a lot for a less than adequate sandwhich .	1	1
1	i 've visited this store _num_ times .	1	1
1	why give french fries with most of them burned ?	1	1
1	they are lazy ass hell !	1	1
1	prepare for the worst when you move over there .	1	1
1	i rushed to tan today after work .	1	1
1	spend your money eating something w personality !	1	1
1	terrible customer service from manager .	1	1
1	go figure cooked , but cold .	1	1
1	and the food was bad .	1	1
1	in addition to shitty service is the lack of service to begin with .	1	1
1	no heavy lifting no reason for my nails to be breaking left and right .	1	1
1	i wish i could give a no star review for this location .	1	1
1	my husband ordered a whiskey sour and our friends and i ordered bloody marys .	1	1
1	my room reeked of mold and mildew .	1	1
1	i took them back and the cleaners cleaned them for free .	1	1
1	finally , we just said thanks , but no thanks and left .	1	1
1	we also did n't get straws , or utensils for our food .	1	1
1	she was super excited and counting down the days until arrival .	1	1
1	juice is cheap .	1	1
1	if anyone 's had theft problems , this may be why .	1	1
1	it takes money to keep the engine running .	1	1
1	so disappointed in food and its cost .	1	1
1	that was not ideal .	1	1
1	it 's all crap .	1	1
1	needless to say , i would n't stay here again if you paid me .	1	1
1	so my meal was the beef ribs with macaroni and cheese and cabbage .	1	1
1	doing some food prep for my job , i called bs on her .	1	1
1	i was never shown anything of told about the $ _num_ per day charge .	1	1
1	ok for _num_ night stay .	1	1
1	dude get over it and go make your ring of fire .	1	1
1	i 'm no longer going back .	1	1
1	not the place to be .	1	1
1	worst chinese food ever .	1	1
1	tip was $ _num_ .	1	1
1	the deal also comes with either a small app or a dessert to share .	1	1
1	not because of the food but the attitude of those cashiers .	1	1
1	avoid at all costs !	1	1
1	it is christmas and i still do n't have it .	1	1
1	the two times i 've been there i was unhappy .	1	1
1	then again - the place is creepy .	1	1
1	crowded , no customer service at any of the businesses .	1	1
1	the _num_ month old is not happy .	1	1
1	six of us went here for friday night fish .	1	1
1	however , the employees in the meat department are very rude .	1	1
1	sometimes i guess expected good customer service is asking for too much .	1	1
1	vietnamese beef noodles were bland and flavorless .	1	1
1	can i give zero stars ?	1	1
1	corporate decided to get rid of the core beers and the beers now suck .	1	1
1	i am able to help move , i just could n't do it alone .	1	1
1	overall , my experience was okay .	1	1
1	we will probably be back , but only after the menu offers better fare .	1	1
1	avoid at all cost .	1	1
1	this review is for alterations only .	1	1
1	are you kidding me ?	1	1
1	walked out without making purchase .	1	1
1	but overall , do n't bother with this hole-in-the-wall .	1	1
1	i responded back to the email and never received and sort of follow up .	1	1
1	i do n't recommend going there .	1	1
1	seating is first come , first served .	1	1
1	the employees at this location vary from indifferent to pretty helpful .	1	1
1	it was very bland , and did n't taste like anything .	1	1
1	however , i ca n't let this slide : your claw machine is bullshit .	1	1
1	the only oyster on the menu is a terrible patty of some kind .	1	1
1	just do n't walk in as a large group .	1	1
1	i ended up buying american tires for the same price elsewhere .	1	1
1	baby on board , we walked in and waited to be greeted .	1	1
1	plus i did n't feel great !	1	1
1	the seasoning certainly did not taste cajun to me .	1	1
1	how can i help you today ? ''	1	1
1	which is sad , really .	1	1
1	were somewhat disappointed ( probably due to higher expectations ) .	1	1
1	does n't matter what you order , be prepared to wait .	1	1
1	i do n't understand how this place is even in business .	1	1
1	they only cost _num_ in paris and _num_ in the rest of the country .	1	1
1	no changing tables in the bathroom .	1	1
1	the soup tasted spoiled , the tomatoes in my salad were frozen and mushy .	1	1
1	poor service from the door .	1	1
1	the guacamole is always bland .	1	1
1	this family of _num_ wo n't be visiting china sea ever again .	1	1
1	you wo n't be getting my business ever again .	1	1
1	painfully mediocre : small rolls , $ _num_ miso soup , drinks were reasonable .	1	1
1	skip this place if you do n't want to feel ill after dining .	1	1
1	there is something always wrong with the apartment .	1	1
1	burgers are adequate - nothing special .	1	1
1	it took our party of _num_ two hours to get our food .	1	1
1	the slaw was reasonably good and cold .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	their sauce is so thin and tasteless .	1	1
1	so far i have witnessed _num_ drug deals in the parking lot .	1	1
1	when i picked it up : _num_ .	1	1
1	cheap , everyone seems to say that .	1	1
1	i am so disappointed .	1	1
1	the food on the other hand was overpriced and gross .	1	1
1	when my dish comes out , it 's literally just steamed veggies and rice .	1	1
1	i want you to know i 'm not just an `` angry customer '' .	1	1
1	i ordered the crab stuffed shrimp and was disappointed .	1	1
1	overall it was n't a bad sandwich at all .	1	1
1	however , they brought out one salad and one meal .	1	1
1	to compare this place to the famous sandwich places is nyc is a joke .	1	1
1	my first visit to blue a few years ago was fabulous .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	they did my cuticles so badly that i was bleeding a whole lot .	1	1
1	i came in with a flat .	1	1
1	no effing way .	1	1
1	they had soooo many birthday celebrations going on as well .	1	1
1	the worst refill i have gotten in my life .	1	1
1	avoid at all costs !	1	1
1	every restaurant closed at 10pm on a friday night .	1	1
1	gross .	1	1
1	ridiculous .	1	1
1	and , most sadly , the cup of coffee was weak .	1	1
1	unacceptable .	1	1
1	i left and went to ace hardware on university avenue .	1	1
1	terrible terrible customer service .	1	1
1	there is no lobby .	1	1
1	the breading was much too heavy and you could barely taste the vegetable .	1	1
1	it was basically dried out , overly thin and the flavor was not good .	1	1
1	we drove _num_ hr .	1	1
1	i was very , very disappointed in this place .	1	1
1	it was karaoke tonight , not my fav but whatever .	1	1
1	we waited almost _num_ minutes for water glasses to be brought to the table .	1	1
1	it 's not fair for the customers or for the servers .	1	1
1	as for a place to spend money uptown i 'd skip it .	1	1
1	it was not spicy .	1	1
1	why would i spend hundreds of dollars on more suits ?	1	1
1	even adding salt and pepper did not help it .	1	1
1	walked in and no one never said hello .	1	1
1	when i walked up everyone was busy with customers .	1	1
1	she did n't come back to the table after that for _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	the potatoes i ordered were extremely salty and had very little flavor .	1	1
1	the thing is the fish does not taste fresh at all !	1	1
1	so i ca n't tell you how the food is .	1	1
1	why did n't we just leave then .	1	1
1	i am so stressed out and very worried .	1	1
1	everything else is a joke .	1	1
1	find a new chef quickly .	1	1
1	and we went over by _num_ cent !	1	1
1	meat was too salty and the hush puppies were just ok , nothing good .	1	1
1	the rice was bland and the dish over all had no spice .	1	1
1	however , the actual hotel room was very disappointing .	1	1
1	that evening our meal at a family restaurant took _num_ hours .	1	1
1	when i walked in and looked over the menu i too was excited .	1	1
1	there are no decent food options within walking distance .	1	1
1	worse nail salon i 've ever experienced .	1	1
1	the food was bland , lukewarm and it had texture .	1	1
1	my recommendation would be to not buy suits , shirts or shoes here .	1	1
1	the oysters are also old , as in not fresh .	1	1
1	we could n't finish our meal .	1	1
1	one of worst patient experiences .	1	1
1	needless to say , i will not be coming back to this place .	1	1
1	the water pressure was borderline painful and the shower head was very low .	1	1
1	* wasting over an hour of my time .	1	1
1	needless to say , we skipped dessert .	1	1
1	i have been here a total of four times .	1	1
1	pirates , steelers , penguins etc ?	1	1
1	i visited charlotte and decided to go here , cause it was crowded .	1	1
1	however , the customer service here is absolutely awful .	1	1
1	the sauce was really disgusting .	1	1
1	it seems like all these hvac guys are out to take advantage .	1	1
1	wish i had looked it up earlier .	1	1
1	i would give our experience zero stars .	1	1
1	very strange experience .	1	1
1	the waiter seated us -- close to the kitchen , i realized with disappointment .	1	1
1	ugh .	1	1
1	delivered our desert in a to go container without us even asking !	1	1
1	my car was almost stolen once even with an alarm on it ?	1	1
1	i got the shrimp and veal and my veal was dry .	1	1
1	i get it , you wan na have a mom and pop shop .	1	1
1	after all it is taco bell .	1	1
1	big waste of time and gas .	1	1
1	i was very excited to try this place .	1	1
1	there was a ton of thai basil in the dish which was quite overwhelming .	1	1
1	the food was tasteless , place looked dirty , and rude waitress .	1	1
1	upon receipt she told the manager she could n't see clearly .	1	1
1	they charge me for things that they do n't have .	1	1
1	i really hate this place .	1	1
1	they threw some tomatoes on it .	1	1
1	the chicken and beef had no seasoning that i could taste at all .	1	1
1	it never seems that clean .	1	1
1	disappointed .	1	1
1	she and i were both a little nervous about getting poor service .	1	1
1	this giant eagle market district is garbage .	1	1
1	rounded down to the next star for this _num_ star review .	1	1
1	nasty & dirty .	1	1
1	i felt like i spent $ _num_ for absolutely nothing .	1	1
1	ordered two personal size pizzas , spicy fries , fried zucchini & onion rings .	1	1
1	with all that said we tried all _num_ flavors of the empanadas they offered .	1	1
1	again , the food was mediocre but the staff was extremely friendly .	1	1
1	very pricey and they automatically add _num_ % gratuity with your bill .	1	1
1	_num_ stars for plate glass window people watching !	1	1
1	mine was just disappointing .	1	1
1	so if you 're coming to drink ... not so bad .	1	1
1	every other experience there was nearly as bad .	1	1
1	really not much to say .	1	1
1	we ordered wings and pierogies for appetizers , for which we waited _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	told _num_ minute wait for food .	1	1
1	especially multiple employees , hostesses , waitresses , and bus boys .	1	1
1	and you do n't even deserve that !	1	1
1	there 's a reason no one goes here .	1	1
1	we did n't have a problem taking it to go .	1	1
1	apart from that , i do n't know why you 'd return .	1	1
1	disgusting .	1	1
1	the garbage cans on site were overflowing with garbage for two days .	1	1
1	i was highly disappointed .	1	1
1	there was no mole sauce as described in the dish .	1	1
1	i will not be going back !	1	1
1	it tasted and looked like rice .	1	1
1	add on : the wifi is awful .	1	1
1	the dispenser in the laundry room was broken .	1	1
1	very rude and unprofessional , let alone unnecessary .	1	1
1	this place is the worst ever .	1	1
1	overall i do n't recommend it and wo n't be going back at all .	1	1
1	yes , more for the garbage .	1	1
1	but it was n't just the knowledge of the menu .	1	1
1	she clearly saw us walk up , and my mother go into the shop .	1	1
1	had _num_ children with me and our lunch was $ _num_ .	1	1
1	and to top it off the woman at the register was very rude .	1	1
1	rude to patron and to his own colleagues .	1	1
1	guess it was ok ?	1	1
1	why is n't this practice illegal ?	1	1
1	the us airways terminal was packed as usual , i expect no less .	1	1
1	go here to die !	1	1
1	fried chicken , chicken tenders , and salmon cakes were also okay .	1	1
1	but i already had a bad taste in my mouth .	1	1
1	do not come here to eat .	1	1
1	they do n't respect your privacy at all .	1	1
1	i was embarrassed for recommending this restaurant .	1	1
1	to add insult to injury , they try to play the club vibe outside .	1	1
1	i 'm not kidding .	1	1
1	bouncer was extremely rude .	1	1
1	slow service ... took almost two hours to deliver on two separate occasions .	1	1
1	does n't even deserve one star in my book .	1	1
1	probably wont go back .	1	1
1	to which my response would have been , `` oh i 'm so sorry .	1	1
1	it just left a bad taste in my mouth .	1	1
1	we sure wish we had gone somewhere else .	1	1
1	this place has ok food and bad customer service .	1	1
1	supposedly there was a computer error with our food .	1	1
1	_num_ minutes later , she finally brought it back for me to sign .	1	1
1	i am visiting from california and was very disappointed with the service and food .	1	1
1	there was absolutely no excuse for his attitude .	1	1
1	nothing special - have no idea why people would rave about this .	1	1
1	the temperature in the restaurant was hot .	1	1
1	terrible service .	1	1
1	but i suspect the rest of the food are blah too .	1	1
1	bar was empty sans a handful of people .	1	1
1	service was indifferent , at best .	1	1
1	sadly this one did n't do that for me .	1	1
1	looks like they are having staffing problems .	1	1
1	a regular ice cream cone was $ _num_ .	1	1
1	i was disappointed the second time .	1	1
1	not one of them acknowledged my presence for at least _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	the food sucked .	1	1
1	i hate this location .	1	1
1	$ _num_ , including tip .	1	1
1	tried this place tonight after reading the reviews .	1	1
1	other than that , meh .	1	1
1	there is one lady that works at the drive thru that is so rude .	1	1
1	the service was not very good .	1	1
1	we ca n't pay something if we do n't know how much to pay .	1	1
1	dirty paper towels all over the women 's bathroom .	1	1
1	if i could give zero stars i would .	1	1
1	it took _num_ minutes for our food to be brought out to us .	1	1
1	i am very upset and disappointed with the service that i have received .	1	1
1	carowinds for that they offer is not worth the drive or the money .	1	1
1	very disappointing !	1	1
1	do n't waste your time or money !	1	1
1	treated badly .	1	1
1	customer service is poor .	1	1
1	there is limited items for those looking for a healthy diet .	1	1
1	does n't make sense especially in this economy .	1	1
1	i could n't even taste garlic in it .	1	1
1	the subway system only goes to one neighborhood from downtown .	1	1
1	for salad , they only served `` caesar salad '' .	1	1
1	( the combo i usually get is _num_ cents less here . )	1	1
1	i will not go again .	1	1
1	there was just one table of _num_ seated and eating when i arrived .	1	1
1	they even have original menus as part of the decor .	1	1
1	i probably wo n't be returning for a hair appointment .	1	1
1	shady and terribly run nail salon .	1	1
1	poor location and service .	1	1
1	$ _num_ down the drain .	1	1
1	evening started pretty badly and did not get much better .	1	1
1	yesterday they were undercooked , gritty , and gross .	1	1
1	unbelievably poor service and super expensive on top of that .	1	1
1	is it possible to give zero stars ?	1	1
1	nothing really special & not worthy of the $ _num_ price tag .	1	1
1	i made the mistake of going -- once -- on a weekend .	1	1
1	not wiped down in a long while or perhaps ever .	1	1
1	and again naturally , no return phone call .	1	1
1	sorry , the food was just horrible .	1	1
1	reservations at 7:00 pm saturday .	1	1
1	it is the worst room i have ever stayed in ever .	1	1
1	and it 's not just coffee , and not just target .	1	1
1	she can walk , but not fast , and not far .	1	1
1	the sauce is very forgettable and watery .	1	1
1	i did not even want to put my purse down .	1	1
1	it should be thicker than what i ate .	1	1
1	i do n't care how good your food is .	1	1
1	_num_ caesar salad with flank steak and another caesar salad with shrimps !	1	1
1	this place is dead , but they just do n't know it yet .	1	1
1	i thought it was going to rip my skin off .	1	1
1	it was over $ _num_ thrown in the trash .	1	1
1	also , their bar seating sucks .	1	1
1	the food does n't have any flavor .	1	1
1	such a waste of money and time.	1	1
1	tasted very good , but i was disappointed in how dirty this place is .	1	1
1	not a big deal just thought it odd .	1	1
1	parking was $ _num_ .	1	1
1	garden ridge is not the same ... it has really gone downhill .	1	1
1	still charging $ _num_ plus $ _num_ for parking .	1	1
1	ugh .	1	1
1	unfortunately the quality of the food is quite low .	1	1
1	will not be my choice for future stays in charlotte .	1	1
1	besides , the egg pasta was too thick .	1	1
1	after another _num_ minutes on hold , i hung up .	1	1
1	no problem right ?	1	1
1	staffs are disrespectful and do n't want to help at all .	1	1
1	very disappointed !	1	1
1	none of that stalls have sanitary pads for the toilet seats either .	1	1
1	terrible .	1	1
1	it , however , did n't work for me .	1	1
1	if someone had been standing there , this would have caused serious injury .	1	1
1	refused to substitute as i see other customers do all the time !	1	1
1	im done w this place .	1	1
1	made a reservation thru priceline on the parking shuttle and got there around 1am .	1	1
1	an older man that works there stared at me and never spoke .	1	1
1	two of us were forced to go the next round .	1	1
1	they were also playing _num_ year old pop music really loud .	1	1
1	poor customer service in all parts of the park .	1	1
1	what i received was a whole milk latte .	1	1
1	the veal was soggy and chewy and the sauce was sub par .	1	1
1	its really too bad , they are super close to my apartment .	1	1
1	i was planning to go again but not anymore .	1	1
1	maybe it was the awful dinner spot they put my husband and i at .	1	1
1	just had the panang tofu for lunch , and was crazy underwhelmed .	1	1
1	it 's not going to happen .	1	1
1	however , she did n't bother , probably because we were n't her table .	1	1
1	the horrible location ?	1	1
1	they have me a baked potato .	1	1
1	avoid this restaurant !	1	1
1	i 'm so glad we split it .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	i expected at least decent and i was extremely disappointed .	1	1
1	_num_ minute wait for a car i reserved a month ago ?	1	1
1	however , we were not offered any and forgot about it until this morning .	1	1
1	it was a total disappointment for me .	1	1
1	the light roast coffee was cold .	1	1
1	that is completely ridiculous .	1	1
1	the coffee shop attached to the hotel is just ok .	1	1
1	does n't seem like good customer service .	1	1
1	waitress was nice but never asked to refill our drinks .	1	1
1	these guys are definitely lazy !	1	1
1	if i could give dr. murphy less than _num_ star , i absolutely would .	1	1
1	i immediately cancelled my appointment and called around .	1	1
1	thumbs down !	1	1
1	also , the service was not that good .	1	1
1	two basic rolls and miso soup for $ _num_ .	1	1
1	i do n't think sammy has ever even had a good corned beef sandwich .	1	1
1	brutal .	1	1
1	i hope the owner or general manager reads this .	1	1
1	okay .	1	1
1	seems dated .	1	1
1	my experiences in this store have not been good for some years now .	1	1
1	the way you are treated is sub par .	1	1
1	horrible horrible horrible .	1	1
1	_num_ star average ?	1	1
1	ppl w/ guns kill ppl .	1	1
1	oh , and the free breakfast was nothing more than dry cereal and juice .	1	1
1	the shrimp sauce was very thick and not that flavorful .	1	1
1	the first bed legit has hair under the sheets ... strike _num_ .	1	1
1	that was frustrating !	1	1
1	both the waitress and the bartender were downright hostile .	1	1
1	very gross .	1	1
1	the washer and dryer was old .	1	1
1	something just feels wrong .	1	1
1	this place was mediocre at best .	1	1
1	world .	1	1
1	i honestly have no clue !	1	1
1	not going for it .	1	1
1	this was not in the lease .	1	1
1	when we sat down , i was immediately hit by a gross smell .	1	1
1	i do n't expect this rock bottom to be around too much longer .	1	1
1	however , i gave this place two stars instead of one .	1	1
1	it was n't even super busy .	1	1
1	we should have requested another waitress at that moment .	1	1
1	overall not the way a restaurant should be run .	1	1
1	)	1	1
1	plus , they never get it right .	1	1
1	every place i 've eaten here is horrible .	1	1
1	when returning to bed , i discovered what appeared to be a bed bug .	1	1
1	it could be worse i guess .	1	1
1	noisy , dirty , poorly renovated and the worst customer service known to man .	1	1
1	but maybe they 're not even trying !	1	1
1	now and then they run a sale : _num_ for $ _num_ .	1	1
1	the chicken was slimy and not many pieces at that .	1	1
1	we were ignored until i grabbed a table in the back .	1	1
1	the worst salon experience of my life .	1	1
1	worst bar ever .	1	1
1	returned with smiles and no hassle .	1	1
1	i should also mention that the salads were served warm along with lukewarm dressing .	1	1
1	could n't keep my eyes open !	1	1
1	my husband and i went here during restaurant week & left feeling disappointed .	1	1
1	i 've basically been told i 'm not getting my security deposit back .	1	1
1	they are n't rated properly , just easy , medium , or hard .	1	1
1	this was n't during peak hours .	1	1
1	but its definitely not worth the money .	1	1
1	really disappointing .	1	1
1	and the prices too high .	1	1
1	bartender came back quickly with what looked like watered down lemonade .	1	1
1	service was bad .	1	1
1	unacceptable !	1	1
1	i did not leave a tip .	1	1
1	waste of my time and money !	1	1
1	next time , i 'll keep walking to johnny burritos .	1	1
1	it 's noisy , crowded , disorganized , and there are not enough waiters .	1	1
1	not impressed .	1	1
1	if answer is yes , then maybe this place is for you .	1	1
1	i 'd say , skip this one .	1	1
1	never have experienced anything like this before !	1	1
1	they are so rude do n't waste your time here .	1	1
1	my husband and i went to buffalo blues last night .	1	1
1	my lasagna was a $ _num_ meal at best .	1	1
1	the atmosphere was atrocious .	1	1
1	this place is so ghetto and trashy .	1	1
1	no one finished their meal .	1	1
1	dark roasted , bitter , etc .	1	1
1	price is not bad .	1	1
1	refused all of those .	1	1
1	avoid this place at all costs !	1	1
1	there has to be better gyms in the area .	1	1
1	very sad that there are people out there taking advantage of per owners .	1	1
1	this is a five star mcdonalds so to speak .	1	1
1	the color of the dish was as bland as the taste .	1	1
1	the side house salad we ordered for an additional $ _num_ was awful .	1	1
1	i would not come back .	1	1
1	it so deserves less than minus !	1	1
1	especially how long you have to wait in this questionable environment .	1	1
1	miso soup had an odd taste this visit .	1	1
1	i think lidia & grandma would be appalled !	1	1
1	and there was no other customers but us .	1	1
1	at night it is a nightmare .	1	1
1	wo n't be back .	1	1
1	the dining room was about half full .	1	1
1	i was extremely disappointed by the lack of presentation .	1	1
1	rude !	1	1
1	overall i was very stuffed at the end of my meal .	1	1
1	i 'm eating very slowly because i want that hot sauce .	1	1
1	they are hire incompetent morons .	1	1
1	the bloody mary was completely disgusting .	1	1
1	huge disappointment .	1	1
1	the meh : the hushpuppies were 1/2 way decent , but nothing extraordinary .	1	1
1	you 're better off buying a frozen pizza and cooking it your self .	1	1
1	so i made sure the door was locked .	1	1
1	no marinara sauce .	1	1
1	i gave the bartender $ _num_ and only received $ _num_ back .	1	1
1	needless to say i was extremely disappointed .	1	1
1	i expressed my disappointment and said please do what you need to do .	1	1
1	annoying .	1	1
1	this is the second time this has happened in less than a month .	1	1
1	this made everyone extremely uncomfortable !	1	1
1	wasted time and time , no compensation .	1	1
1	not returning anytime soon .	1	1
1	i begin to munch on my fries and they were lukewarm .	1	1
1	the barber could not even cut a straight fade .	1	1
1	half of the floors do n't have vending machines .	1	1
1	the night was not lost .	1	1
1	the service was fast but the food was terrible and so was the service .	1	1
1	gave the restaurant a second shot - equally disappointed .	1	1
1	they then brought out two manicotti dinners which were fine .	1	1
1	this place is as bland as they get .	1	1
1	for three days no one called or picked up the clothes .	1	1
1	then i had to pay them $ _num_ to get my suv back .	1	1
1	this is very misleading .	1	1
1	i would not go back because i did n't feel welcomed at all .	1	1
1	i will not be coming back .	1	1
1	sanitation rating _num_ ?	1	1
1	that makes no sense .	1	1
1	when our food came though , everything was below average .	1	1
1	her potatoes were ice cold and sandwich luke warm .	1	1
1	delivery : horrible experience .	1	1
1	the milk shake was taking long so i begin eating my room temp nuggets .	1	1
1	it cost me _num_ to get extensions so my hair looked thicker .	1	1
1	i have paid $ _num_ for a car was and received a better quality .	1	1
1	do n't you care about your reputation and good name ?	1	1
1	an absolute mess .	1	1
1	too big , almost .	1	1
1	firstly , this place used to be free to the public .	1	1
1	as i was walking in i noticed a sign stating estimates were $ _num_ .	1	1
1	did n't see too much in particular that i loved about this place .	1	1
1	_num_ minutes .	1	1
1	we also had a masala and that too was not great .	1	1
1	i had to scream to someone a foot away from me to be heard .	1	1
1	i gave them my credit card and they said it was declined .	1	1
1	i do n't really take kindly to people speaking so rudely to my mother .	1	1
1	i did n't find it to be anything special .	1	1
1	i 'd give this company zero stars if it were an option .	1	1
1	very bland and veal was tough pasta and veal had no salt .	1	1
1	the floors had trash all over them .	1	1
1	the worst customer service ever !	1	1
1	but waited over _num_ minutes for them to take our order .	1	1
1	only because i live nearby .	1	1
1	it 's soup and a wedge salad .	1	1
1	it was also annoying to us since this place is not cheap .	1	1
1	in fact the room we sat in had approximately _num_ open tables .	1	1
1	last time i ordered contacts , the wrong prescription was sent home with me .	1	1
1	this is a gathering place for human garbage anymore .	1	1
1	printed out my receipt .	1	1
1	lindsay informed me they do n't offer egg whites , really ?	1	1
1	will not be back .	1	1
1	hate to say it but i would rather eat at taco bell .	1	1
1	caesar salad was drowning in tart dressing .	1	1
1	the next room was worse .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	we were so disappointed .	1	1
1	( that was about _num_ minutes in itself . )	1	1
1	she was appalling and rude .	1	1
1	i had the stuffed shrimp , he had the almond crusted tilapia .	1	1
1	so i went through the whole thing for nothing .	1	1
1	no , the waiter was quick to tell me i ordered medium rare .	1	1
1	first of all , it is in a sketchy part of charlotte .	1	1
1	tables and chairs are always nasty .	1	1
1	and the service is always painfully slow .	1	1
1	i ca n't stand this airport .	1	1
1	fitness room only includes cardio .	1	1
1	tables , benches , whatever it is , dirty .	1	1
1	however , we had the papaya salad as an appetizer and that was great .	1	1
1	i told my server that the pizza was n't good .	1	1
1	the layout of clt is terrible .	1	1
1	i do n't get how they use better ingredients and it tastes terrible .	1	1
1	thinking back and forth on it did n't seem right .	1	1
1	the salad was basic iceberg lettuce and a few other veggies .	1	1
1	it made me sick .	1	1
1	disaster !	1	1
1	my wife then confirmed her day off from work .	1	1
1	i had _num_ pancakes and they were hard and the syrup was cold .	1	1
1	staff was nice , pedicure was horrible .	1	1
1	the service was terrible .	1	1
1	and it tasted so microwaved .	1	1
1	the least she could have done was to put a credit on my account .	1	1
1	but the beef ribs were okay and so were the side .	1	1
1	i was warned by others that this is mainly where tourists eat .	1	1
1	the meals are over priced and just ok in terms of quality .	1	1
1	this would n't really bother me much if the food was better .	1	1
1	but why support a business that really does n't care about you .	1	1
1	purchased two suits and other items for my son , spending over $ _num_ .	1	1
1	he offered no solution for the shirt that his business ruined .	1	1
1	at _num_ pm i asked for my car .	1	1
1	not the drivers fault .	1	1
1	do not get your alterations done at this location !	1	1
1	worst service ever !	1	1
1	his jacket did n't fit and his white shirt was worse than mine .	1	1
1	the river view from the deck was nice , but the smokers were not .	1	1
1	this particular location is pretty hit or miss .	1	1
1	waitress showed up _num_ min later .	1	1
1	first thing i knew was iffy was the meat and cheese plate .	1	1
1	it is unfortunate that they have such a rude office manager .	1	1
1	i wrote an email using their contact us form and never heard anything back .	1	1
1	i will not be coming back here .	1	1
1	what was left was less than 1/2 pound .	1	1
1	i 'm constantly amazed by how rude the receptionists are .	1	1
1	but , they act as though i 've asked for the world .	1	1
1	they are completely mean and disrespectful .	1	1
1	ca n't comment on any other time but this really hectic one .	1	1
1	i asked wth and they told me , management change .	1	1
1	what a nightmare .	1	1
1	well , i have never felt more embarrassed in a situation .	1	1
1	of course , it was not what we wanted , the club .	1	1
1	in any case , i was a little let down .	1	1
1	i immediately noticed how unfriendly the sushi `` chef '' was .	1	1
1	well sports rock failed on all accounts .	1	1
1	really bad service !	1	1
1	the food was horrible and they included the tip without asking .	1	1
1	it was humongous but not that tasty , pretty dry .	1	1
1	terrible experience !	1	1
1	this was gross and a waste of _num_ dollars .	1	1
1	steak for _num_ and was told _num_ to _num_ minutes for pickup .	1	1
1	did n't even ask for my money back i was so disgusted .	1	1
1	they lack favor in their food .	1	1
1	i took the olive oil off the table next to ours .	1	1
1	waited for about _num_ minutes at the entrance .	1	1
1	my husband 's salad , italian chopped , was better .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	price does n't matter to me at all , though .	1	1
1	french fries are pretty standard .	1	1
1	no one could look at it because they had an appointment at _num_ .	1	1
1	will never return to the store .	1	1
1	so , he took the meals back to the kitchen .	1	1
1	no way to rate a _num_ !	1	1
1	car was ok otherwise .	1	1
1	overall , a disappointing dining experience .	1	1
1	she did not apologize and says that it will take another _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	sadly i can not support a business that provides such poor service .	1	1
1	i do n't think i 'll give this place another chance .	1	1
1	probably the slowest drive-thru i 've ever experienced .	1	1
1	sent the mussels back .	1	1
1	she slowly responded `` yeah '' hardly looking up .	1	1
1	obviously this is insane .	1	1
1	that 's unacceptable .	1	1
1	overly sweet and not so appetizing .	1	1
1	probably give it another shot but not my first choice considering the prices .	1	1
1	if you 're desperate for chinese , get it to go .	1	1
1	the server went out of her way to make us feel uncomfortable .	1	1
1	i would n't recommend this place .	1	1
1	it had no signs of being coated and sauted to a rich golden brown .	1	1
1	this proved to have been a massive error in judgement on all our parts .	1	1
1	they can not even cook edamame , it was undercooked and cold .	1	1
1	i used their online service to pick up my laundry .	1	1
1	$ _num_ a week plus gone from them .	1	1
1	the the service was okay and i was atmosphere was not that great .	1	1
1	unfortunately i found this mcdonald 's in need of a good cleaning .	1	1
1	the salad was ... nothing short of horrific .	1	1
1	-the room was just dingy .	1	1
1	hot and sour soup was bland .	1	1
1	the chicken tortilla soup was just ok .	1	1
1	blue could be great but it 's not .	1	1
1	i was in there _num_ minutes before anyone spoke with me .	1	1
1	i do n't know if i can ever return to buca .	1	1
1	luckily we had a fabulous dinner at another restaurant instead .	1	1
1	no , she went ahead anyway .	1	1
1	they are not very through .	1	1
1	i have never been treated so badly by a physicians office .	1	1
1	terrible .	1	1
1	biggest waste of money !	1	1
1	so all-in-all , the food was sub-par at best .	1	1
1	slow and inattentive .	1	1
1	yes , i am going to make a direct comparison between these two establishments .	1	1
1	i witnessed more apologies to customers that day than i ever have .	1	1
1	they have a sanitation rating of _num_ % .	1	1
1	hell , i may not even last _num_ bites .	1	1
1	i would not recommend this place for food .	1	1
1	the meatballs sub , my mother said was cold and undercooked .	1	1
1	i called two more times after this with no call back .	1	1
1	let me tell you about the worst shopping experience i 've ever had .	1	1
1	ca n't wait to cancel service .	1	1
1	i would not entertain having an event for any more than _num_ people .	1	1
1	i refused to eat while my companion 's ate .	1	1
1	she simply said `` ok '' and walked out of the room .	1	1
1	i stayed three nights at the westin with a group for a conference .	1	1
1	the guacamole tasted stale and had the wrong consistency .	1	1
1	lost _num_ stars for that .	1	1
1	all i got was a chopped up piece of crap that was useless .	1	1
1	and that , sir , is why you got a $ _num_ tip !	1	1
1	the only redeeming quality is the young girl who works here .	1	1
1	no seasoning .	1	1
1	as my boyfriend was talking with the cab company , a waitress walked by .	1	1
1	1st it reeks of cigarettes .	1	1
1	i get to the room and the electronic key does not work .	1	1
1	bad customer service and to be honest we had bad service all around .	1	1
1	i paid $ _num_ for shipping .	1	1
1	there luckily was a subway up the street .	1	1
1	but seriously , there are still restaurants that allow smoking ?	1	1
1	go down the street and get some tastier food at tram 's kitchen .	1	1
1	even the staff is miserable anymore .	1	1
1	if you live in the area , i guess you have no choice .	1	1
1	and that is just annoying .	1	1
1	the wifi signal is weak .	1	1
1	i got tired of spending _num_ minutes of my lunch break waiting in line .	1	1
1	this is an older dick 's sporting goods location .	1	1
1	do n't expect any help when things get ruined .	1	1
1	okay , i know what you 're thinking why not just leave ?	1	1
1	the restaurant has the diner feel , no doubt .	1	1
1	bought the store 's speciality sausages - bland and tasted of spoiled meat .	1	1
1	then _num_ mins to get our food !	1	1
1	the room doors are all spring loaded to they slam shut .	1	1
1	it was very soupy and did not have any noodles ?	1	1
1	i would not recommend working with dollar bank for a home mortgage .	1	1
1	and after her comments , i 'm so glad that i decided to leave .	1	1
1	internet is very cheap and should be provided accordingly .	1	1
1	the sauce tasted old and i could n't even stomach to eat it .	1	1
1	they brought mussels instead of our mozzarella sticks .	1	1
1	they 'll gladly take your money , however , good luck getting issues resolved .	1	1
1	wo n't be coming back anytime soon .	1	1
1	for some reason two drinks came out to $ _num_ .	1	1
1	wrong !	1	1
1	smells gross all the time , small portions for a hella large price tag .	1	1
1	we simply ordered _num_ bagels , coffee and tea for breakfast .	1	1
1	also , the french fries had probably been prepared _num_ minutes previous .	1	1
1	no big deal for my me or my wallet .	1	1
1	anything will taste better drenched in gravy .	1	1
1	but they 've lost my business for good .	1	1
1	just got off the phone with a lady from construction junction .	1	1
1	as for beverages , they really skimp .	1	1
1	this location was no different .	1	1
1	he was very weird -- asked personal questions that were none of his business .	1	1
1	nothing about the visit stands out to me .	1	1
1	the entrees , however , left much to be desired .	1	1
1	but the pork although being tender and moist was disappointing .	1	1
1	i was recently at this store to make an expensive jewelry purchase .	1	1
1	never did get a refill on iced tea .	1	1
1	the worst thing about this place is also sam .	1	1
1	it was also very loud .	1	1
1	food is a bit over priced and nothing to write home about .	1	1
1	i am giving it _num_ stars only because the manager was nice .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	worst brazilian wax i have ever gotten .	1	1
1	but it was n't during peak hours .	1	1
1	visited on a friday night and it was pretty crowded .	1	1
1	not much more , but enough to make it not right .	1	1
1	sadly not worth the money or time .	1	1
1	went there last night about 5:30 , the place was maybe half full .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	the front desk staff was not interested in helping me checkin .	1	1
1	went to barnes and noble waterfront with _num_ books on my list .	1	1
1	plus , i do n't care for the taste of their ice cream .	1	1
1	mediocre food service and atmosphere .	1	1
1	they were returned to me a full size smaller than i dropped them off .	1	1
1	i am upset to report that this tasted rather bland .	1	1
1	wow , what a bad experience .	1	1
1	i 've been a yelp user for years .	1	1
1	why is it so hard to find a good chinese restaurant in pittsburgh ?	1	1
1	same with my ginger ale .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	plus , no free wifi !	1	1
1	the car i reserved was not in my gold space so i went inside .	1	1
1	not so much .	1	1
1	i 'm sure no one at this location cares either !	1	1
1	horrible service !	1	1
1	buffalo blues was neither .	1	1
1	i would recommend never eating here .	1	1
1	worst elevator system i 've ever come across .	1	1
1	you get a lot of food but its kind of expensive for lunch .	1	1
1	that does not make me chop liver .	1	1
1	horrible service .	1	1
1	i read about good stuff here but was very disappointed .	1	1
1	for old looking sad food i did n't even want to eat .	1	1
1	on the outside , it looks like a corner business .	1	1
1	extremely poor service .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	the fruit was n't ripe and over all the experience was just bad .	1	1
1	ok , i did , and i stopped eating .	1	1
1	do you ever leave a place and feel exhausted ?	1	1
1	it 's tired and needs a major overhaul .	1	1
1	not even remotely convenient .	1	1
1	the food sucks and we will not return .	1	1
1	singapore had this for their buses in _num_ !	1	1
1	i just came from lunch with coworkers here .	1	1
1	lettuce was ice cold , nearly frozen .	1	1
1	mediocre service .	1	1
1	he put me in the first room , next to the front desk .	1	1
1	disgusting !	1	1
1	this place does n't deserve the business .	1	1
1	a simple addition of caramelized onions would have solved this problem .	1	1
1	unfortunately , it appears to be very poorly managed .	1	1
1	white rice was rice was fine .	1	1
1	the `` meat '' in my dish was some greasy lips and assholes .	1	1
1	our entrees were n't much better .	1	1
1	sunday morning , was looking forward to a bloody mary .	1	1
1	also got the teriyaki beef which was like shoe leather ( very tough ) .	1	1
1	i interacted with staff to get help with a machine that was n't working .	1	1
1	i do n't shop at stores that hire such terrible staff .	1	1
1	i ordered chicken wings as an appetizer ... ummm that was definitely a given !	1	1
1	honestly , this is the worst food i 've ever purchased .	1	1
1	oh , with _num_ pitiful shrimp on top .	1	1
1	dip for the chips are cold and beer is room temperature .	1	1
1	these place are virtually the same .	1	1
1	if zero was an option that is what i would rate them !	1	1
1	so let me go over this : i have a coupon .	1	1
1	this is supposed to be the best burgers in the 'burgh .	1	1
1	i do n't understand this either .	1	1
1	not worth the trip .	1	1
1	all in all , it was a disappointment this year .	1	1
1	it 's a shame .	1	1
1	there were n't remotely interested in us or our business .	1	1
1	but probably not for dinner .	1	1
1	swimming i tell you swimming in grease !	1	1
1	the park road office has terrible management and are very unprofessional .	1	1
1	this is so frustrating !	1	1
1	and they still seem to give our guest the wrong food .	1	1
1	but when it came out it just looked like a bowl of lard .	1	1
1	a small airport that needs some improvement .	1	1
1	drop off was better than pick up , but that 's not saying much .	1	1
1	i have never been so disappointed with a company .	1	1
1	this is the worst airport layout ever .	1	1
1	do not waste your money !	1	1
1	seriously just do n't do it .	1	1
1	unfortunately , a charlotte main stay has worn out the welcome pad .	1	1
1	appetizers : nothing really wrong here .	1	1
1	_num_ people ordered wine , and the first _num_ got it in wine glasses .	1	1
1	it was terrible , terrible service .	1	1
1	they refuse to put anything on paper .	1	1
1	overall , my experience was just ok , but nothing memorable .	1	1
1	the deposit i was aware of but the $ _num_ i was n't .	1	1
1	entire car was dusty , inside and out .	1	1
1	the worst best buy i have ever visited .	1	1
1	well they missed the boat .	1	1
1	worst italian food i have ever eaten .	1	1
1	not a fan .	1	1
1	ugh .	1	1
1	this bk needs better management and training for the employees .	1	1
1	it was awful !	1	1
1	!	1	1
1	half the sandwich falls out while your eating .	1	1
1	i ordered medium-rare and it was purple , barely cooked in the middle .	1	1
1	the lines are always long and take forever to get through .	1	1
1	even taco bell 's tacos were better tasting than this one .	1	1
1	the _num_ of us got to bar louie at 8:30 .	1	1
1	everyone else obviously hates their job and could care less about your medical problems .	1	1
1	we had to flag down our waitress just to get refills .	1	1
1	it did n't get any better with salt .	1	1
1	while this is happening , several waitresses come to the bar to get drinks .	1	1
1	but most of the time this place just falls flat .	1	1
1	never going back .	1	1
1	the message to me is management must be blind & ignorant .	1	1
1	if not , um , why would we want to pay for it ?	1	1
1	even when we asked for more towels they said only _num_ per room .	1	1
1	half the time our drinks were empty .	1	1
1	was n't the best either .	1	1
1	very disappointing meal .	1	1
1	needless to say , this completely ruined my meal .	1	1
1	i soon left and went over to olive garden for lunch .	1	1
1	she did , however , return quickly with a hair dryer .	1	1
1	also he asked me if i wanted a menu ... ... strange .	1	1
1	hostess was very awkward when seating us .	1	1
1	never going back again and i would advise against master muffler to all others .	1	1
1	i 'm going back to enterprise though i have no status with them .	1	1
1	my friend 's greek salad however was very tasty .	1	1
1	do n't take it out on the person they are incorrectly calling .	1	1
1	so i ordered that just to try the raspberry dressing , and huge disappointment .	1	1
1	been in three airports on our trip to north carolina .	1	1
1	i 've had better meals at the complimentary continental buffet at the holiday inn .	1	1
1	we skip by it now .	1	1
1	what i received was just turkey .	1	1
1	are you kidding me ?	1	1
1	i 'm so disappointed .	1	1
1	on the 2nd load every it refused to turn off .	1	1
1	go elsewhere trying to save you from a nightmare at the dry cleaners !	1	1
1	the service can also be rather slow .	1	1
1	i called the collection agency and they refuse to work with me .	1	1
1	some drinks were returned from the bar while some never reached the table .	1	1
1	no flavor , soggy french fries , over sauces wings .	1	1
1	another co-worker who ordered a combo was given the wrong food .	1	1
1	the food was mediocre .	1	1
1	in addition to being condescending , they hung up on me .	1	1
1	sure she knew that rude .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	maybe i 'm just salty about the wait .	1	1
1	worst paper on the planet .	1	1
1	very disappointed that i can not be seen sooner .	1	1
1	once we did get seated , service was slow and really bad .	1	1
1	was not impressed at all .	1	1
1	i 'm just going to break this down into pros vs cons .	1	1
1	the bread was even bad .	1	1
1	avoid this company if you can .	1	1
1	would n't go back .	1	1
1	king nasty !	1	1
1	actually just had an awful experience with a manager named chris .	1	1
1	one of the nail techs was constantly hitting on me .	1	1
1	never understood all the hype about this place .	1	1
1	the item should be called buffalo soup with chicken strips .	1	1
1	waitress was supposed to go and get our next round of drinks .	1	1
1	_num_ minutes go by and none of the couples before us have been seated .	1	1
1	it all could have been so easily avoided .	1	1
1	unbelievable .	1	1
1	how can you mess up wonton soup and vegetable spring rolls .	1	1
1	left and halfway home , `` check engine '' light came back on .	1	1
1	?	1	1
1	a cup given with no ice and a bottle of soda ?	1	1
1	by far the worst shellac manicure i have ever had .	1	1
1	also the food was bland and pretty much flavorless , very disappointing .	1	1
1	i will never order pizza from this store nor any people i know !	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	they never bothered to refill the bread basket .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	needless to say none of us wanted to order another round of drinks .	1	1
1	do n't miss the _num_ pound tub of msg as you walk in .	1	1
1	but it 's also dead .	1	1
1	never had problem at other locations .	1	1
1	con : they only accept cash .	1	1
1	this trip has no internet .	1	1
1	they just wanted to work , i guess .	1	1
1	the entire restaurant could use a thorough cleaning .	1	1
1	will probably never go here again because the person servicing me was rude .	1	1
1	and the restaurant is empty !	1	1
1	* no shopping carts .	1	1
1	between two of them they finished one piece and could n't tolerate anymore .	1	1
1	description said grain mustard cole slaw and pickles .	1	1
1	anyway , if i lived here i doubt i 'd hang here much .	1	1
1	the worst of our experience ?	1	1
1	hot dog was not bad but nothing to write home about .	1	1
1	not a sign of management .	1	1
1	by far the worst restaurant in the airport .	1	1
1	they delivered pizza with the wrong toppings .	1	1
1	they did n't wash my hair and the haircut took about _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	service was super slow .	1	1
1	everything else we had sucked .	1	1
1	the fries were ways very soggy and cold .	1	1
1	so it has made us assume that everyone in charlotte must be as well .	1	1
1	hate you .	1	1
1	it was disgusting .	1	1
1	but last few times i have gone it has not taste the same .	1	1
1	terrible service , lead by tim .	1	1
1	but i just can not bring myself to do my normal grocery shopping here .	1	1
1	thai corn soup jumbo crab ?	1	1
1	this is the worst place i have ever lived in all my years !	1	1
1	employees are unbelievably rude most of the time .	1	1
1	terrible for business travel .	1	1
1	in buffalo , we like a little pasta with our sauce .	1	1
1	yep , that loud .	1	1
1	also my girlfriend got very sick after eating here .	1	1
1	the corn sat there the whole time we ate our meal .	1	1
1	way too long , for something so simple .	1	1
1	the coffee is okay , nothing special .	1	1
1	i would n't stay here again .	1	1
1	horrible !	1	1
1	the place is rather run down .	1	1
1	the worst bar and the worst service in the area .	1	1
1	horrible customer service !	1	1
1	that 's the only reason why i gave them such a poor mark .	1	1
1	no reply .	1	1
1	i 'm glad this place is for emergency service only ( for us ) .	1	1
1	another bad experience two times in a row .	1	1
1	are you kidding me ?	1	1
1	he was great but everything else was extremely slow .	1	1
1	the owner has to be the problem .	1	1
1	the sweet and sour chicken was disgusting .	1	1
1	this ruined my anniversary !	1	1
1	wrong .	1	1
1	i ordered _num_ ground beef tacos with black beans and rice .	1	1
1	i finally had the chance last week and was surprisingly disappointed .	1	1
1	the owner could care less about customers .	1	1
1	sure they took a few days and gave me light bulbs .	1	1
1	if it were up to me i would have never returned .	1	1
1	beer selection below average and nothing special happening with speciality drinks .	1	1
1	terrible customer service .	1	1
1	i was less than impressed .	1	1
1	sorry , how can you not have $ _num_ in change ?	1	1
1	the bread was soggy and you could not even tell it was toasted .	1	1
1	Negative	1	1
1	not a good start .	1	1
1	employees behind the counter would disappear for _num_ , _num_ minutes with no explanation .	1	1
1	it was kind of confusing .	1	1
1	only then are you informed how long the wait will be .	1	1
1	unbelievable and with my little girl there .	1	1
1	worse customer service i have received in quite awhile .	1	1
1	not to be recommended unless you 're desperate .	1	1
1	avoid !	1	1
1	last week i stopped by to get the battery of my watch changed .	1	1
1	$ _num_ / salad ?	1	1
1	it was a terrible experience .	1	1
1	we made the unfortunate decision to make a reservation here for a special occasion .	1	1
1	so very rude .	1	1
1	hotwire is the reason for all my problems .	1	1
1	they frequently mess up my friends orders when we go there .	1	1
1	she did n't come to our table and apologize for the ribs or chicken .	1	1
1	only came back once to fill our drinks .	1	1
1	here 's where i ran into problems .	1	1
1	outside of the bread i ca n't say it was memorable in any way .	1	1
1	again , no herbs and spices .	1	1
1	- kind of dead on a monday night with 3/4 of the place empty .	1	1
1	it 's missing most of the things that make longer stays tolerable .	1	1
1	sigh ... never ordering from them again .	1	1
1	the food is really bad .	1	1
1	highly disappointed !	1	1
1	we ordered the filet mignon with chicken hibachi .	1	1
1	never checked on , offered additional drinks or dessert .	1	1
1	two seconds later , they come to want to clean ?	1	1
1	my recommendation was to burn this place to the ground .	1	1
1	this is a very small irish pub .	1	1
1	i will not be going back .	1	1
1	when you try to cancel it takes forever and they are rude !	1	1
1	i 'll avoid this mcdonald 's at night .	1	1
1	the entree my dining companion ordered was also sub-par .	1	1
1	bad idea .	1	1
1	the only fast service was for the drinks and cornbread .	1	1
1	the sandwich was just gross .	1	1
1	i can not comment on the main courses as we did not have any .	1	1
1	only good thing about this place was my company .	1	1
1	never going back .	1	1
1	only in a pinch .	1	1
1	its easy to be dissatisfied and rant about a customer services organization .	1	1
1	the customer service at this location is terrible .	1	1
1	no less than _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	not because the food is bad but because i like to try new places .	1	1
1	never ever will i order from here again .	1	1
1	no call .	1	1
1	i tried the gyro wrap which was also a big disappointment .	1	1
1	wo n't visit again .	1	1
1	she then starts up the stairs and says `` no go upstairs . ''	1	1
1	third , the food was lacking in proper seasoning and without any taste .	1	1
1	the place sucks , and closes at _num_ am .	1	1
1	i was not impressed with my sandwich there .	1	1
1	the new dentist could n't believe that !	1	1
1	the bad : food is mediocre .	1	1
1	it 's sad .	1	1
1	i used to really like outback in nj but i 'm in nc now .	1	1
1	lobby bar staff was unfriendly .	1	1
1	service -- - probably the worst service i 've ever had there .	1	1
1	the greens were just succulent .	1	1
1	they refuse to put a camera in the package room , parking lot too .	1	1
1	a lot of veggies very little steak or chicken .	1	1
1	the young woman did not greet us in the most welcoming manner .	1	1
1	maybe it 's just hertz .	1	1
1	we used to really like their lasagna and pizza .	1	1
1	but i 'm sure the mall 's rent killed them .	1	1
1	my mother , daughter and i went here last week .	1	1
1	customer service is not even located in this country .	1	1
1	the pad thai was not good and that 's what it should be !	1	1
1	my roast duck was a little misleading considering it was more fried than roasted .	1	1
1	we like longhorn , but not this location .	1	1
1	at $ _num_ each this falls clearly into the ripoff category .	1	1
1	this restaurant is so gross and it 's dirty .	1	1
1	recently had my son 's 9th birthday party here .	1	1
1	made the same mistake 2x by going to these clowns .	1	1
1	bland food and poor service .	1	1
1	i assume he was the owner because he said `` my company '' .	1	1
1	unless you like being ignored , avoid , avoid , avoid !	1	1
1	on to the important part ... food was terrible .	1	1
1	i was _num_ minutes early for the bus i was trying to catch .	1	1
1	this place had horrible service .	1	1
1	next time it avis or anyone else beside hertz .	1	1
1	i went here after a car accident that was not my fault .	1	1
1	another ordered the fried calamari appetizer ( $ _num_ ) .	1	1
1	quite possibly the worst experience i have ever had dealing with a clothing store .	1	1
1	no personality and did n't make us feel welcome .	1	1
1	but getting to that point was one disaster after another .	1	1
1	the spring rolls were completely soggy .	1	1
1	the only seasoning available are salt , pepper , hot sauce , & ketchup .	1	1
1	not nice ... .	1	1
1	my husband and i went tonight for dinner .	1	1
1	her meal was so hot she could n't eat it .	1	1
1	i was rather disappointed in most aspects .	1	1
1	monday , no phone call all day .	1	1
1	it was clear to me this burger was not fresh .	1	1
1	i knew my one experience wednesday night was too good to be true .	1	1
1	there were only two orders ahead of me , utterly ridiculous .	1	1
1	i do n't want my money to go towards hate .	1	1
1	save your money , shop elsewhere .	1	1
1	avoid this place .	1	1
1	why people go here i ca n't understand .	1	1
1	the waitress made it seem as though it was my fault for bringing him .	1	1
1	there were romaine core in the salad and one slice of cucumber .	1	1
1	the entrance to this location always smells like spoiled milk .	1	1
1	the `` chicken '' is dark , fatty , and inedible .	1	1
1	that same day i called another company and booked them with no issues .	1	1
1	we will not be back .	1	1
1	needless to say , we did n't stay to eat and went elsewhere .	1	1
1	it seemed like every single employee was around _num_ years old .	1	1
1	no bathrooms .	1	1
1	new , clean but horrible service .	1	1
1	however , check the price of a beer before you buy it .	1	1
1	terrible .	1	1
1	ok , i 'm lying .	1	1
1	the steaks came and were both overcooked .	1	1
1	poor excuse for a gentleman 's store .	1	1
1	the bread was cheap and tasteless .	1	1
1	bland $ _num_ of waste !	1	1
1	i really do n't get the hype as the food was average at best .	1	1
1	try a waffle house and i think you 'll have a better dining experience .	1	1
1	not worth the attitude of the staff .	1	1
1	it 's happened everytime i go and it 's really unprofessional .	1	1
1	too cramped .	1	1
1	umm , why the double tax ?	1	1
1	the downstairs [ outside of our group ] was dead .	1	1
1	it did n't even taste like pad thai .	1	1
1	trying to eat `` fresh '' pineapple with no wine just breaks my heart .	1	1
1	food was _num_ mins late .	1	1
1	first off our server acted like she could care less .	1	1
1	five minutes later the $ _num_ easter special came out .	1	1
1	i 'm no fair weather fan , but 20+ years of losing is enough .	1	1
1	the price was extremely high for food that was bland and not impressive .	1	1
1	nobody tried to even convince us to stay .	1	1
1	the bathtub was extremely dirty .	1	1
1	the only redeeming quality is the decor .	1	1
1	the owner gave that table to a local group who showed up after us .	1	1
1	well i went there on january _num_ to return my mattress .	1	1
1	it was all downhill from there .	1	1
1	however , i was extremely disappointed .	1	1
1	i called them only to find out my truck had n't even left charlotte .	1	1
1	the biggest downfall of duke 's , though , is the food .	1	1
1	my girlfriend ordered the fish along with fries and baked beans .	1	1
1	what a complete disaster .	1	1
1	worst service ever .	1	1
1	they were large , tough and tasteless .	1	1
1	what i found was a large room filled with unappetizing , boring baked goods .	1	1
1	so i only ordered lunch .	1	1
1	only another _num_ minutes until he brought one martini over .	1	1
1	it was loud and crowded .	1	1
1	there is paint on the grill and damage from where the tape was removed .	1	1
1	there were _num_ customers ahead of me and _num_ ladies behind the counter .	1	1
1	worst wait times ever , staff is inefficient .	1	1
1	i was n't really a fan .	1	1
1	it was decently greasy and the crust was n't all that special .	1	1
1	but this was pretty bad .	1	1
1	you can tell they use cheap steak and lobster .	1	1
1	so , i 've tried this place _num_ times and that was enough .	1	1
1	the waiter said they get really busy so they bring the check first .	1	1
1	i just do n't understand how anyone can like this place .	1	1
1	they lacked the variety of bagels and cream cheeses i am used to seeing .	1	1
1	more frustrating than conversations with the wall .	1	1
1	granted , the calamari and shrimp that were there were cooked perfectly .	1	1
1	there were maybe _num_ people around the bar .	1	1
1	mediocre at best .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	overpriced and overwhelming .	1	1
1	how in the hell is the line always long when the food is trash ?	1	1
1	not here .	1	1
1	it was so tiny and there was hardly any chicken in it .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	terrible dry cleaners !	1	1
1	maybe it 's nostalgia for the cigar but i thought he looked ridiculous .	1	1
1	such a waste of time .	1	1
1	no flavor .	1	1
1	horrible customer service and they always screw up our orders .	1	1
1	i 'd give only _num_ star , but previous visits were acceptable .	1	1
1	that was pretty lame .	1	1
1	the two stars are bonus points , but it gets the basics wrong .	1	1
1	i took my young son with me so it was just dinner no alcohol .	1	1
1	it was returned with a hole in back of suit jacket .	1	1
1	and the breakfast is n't very good at all .	1	1
1	the hotel itself is ok .	1	1
1	it was an awful experience .	1	1
1	it 's dirty , food is gross and the wait staff is just pathetic .	1	1
1	my first ... ... .	1	1
1	service is always slow .	1	1
1	zero stars .	1	1
1	nothing was awful , but nothing stood out in any way .	1	1
1	it just does n't match her books or shows at all .	1	1
1	i am from chicago and the people there are nicer than they were here .	1	1
1	very disappointed .	1	1
1	would not recommend it .	1	1
1	closes before _num_ pm and locked the doors as i walked up .	1	1
1	we could n't eat it .	1	1
1	seriously , and it gets much worse .	1	1
1	arrangement was just ok .	1	1
1	i want so badly to like this place !	1	1
1	so salty i ate one and threw them out .	1	1
1	and points off for cutting out indoor smoking .	1	1
1	none of these tasted good , tom yum soup was kinda disgusting .	1	1
1	it 's just not that good .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	food was ok , nothing much to speak of .	1	1
1	but boy oh boy was i completely disappointed in my meal !	1	1
1	unbelievably poor customer service .	1	1
1	what a disappointment .	1	1
1	big box , impersonal hotel .	1	1
1	not a fan .	1	1
1	to date that has not happened .	1	1
1	went to thai house on a thursday around 8pm .	1	1
1	maybe they should pay me for this responsibility .	1	1
1	also , do n't leave fast food on a table in the dining area .	1	1
1	it made me not want to drink my water even though i was thirsty .	1	1
1	very rude .	1	1
1	that 's not good when you 're ordering food .	1	1
1	ok no biggie , but then came the food .	1	1
1	service was incredibly slow .	1	1
1	the fist time after a _num_ minute wait , they brought the wrong food .	1	1
1	this was my first and last time at this restaurant .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	the pad thai was dry and tasteless .	1	1
1	this is a scam and highly unacceptable .	1	1
1	that was $ _num_ down the drain .	1	1
1	the food was ok but nothing to great .	1	1
1	not handicapped accessible .	1	1
1	peel and eat shrimp were dry and tough , not fresh .	1	1
1	management did n't even come by table to apologize about the wait .	1	1
1	crime is a problem !	1	1
1	i almost left but just ordered fried chicken tenders and too salty fries .	1	1
1	worst service ever .	1	1
1	i 'm weird like that .	1	1
1	i 'm going to have to revisit in the near future to investigate .	1	1
1	staff was not friendly .	1	1
1	the upscale prices did not match the dingy and dirty store .	1	1
1	we were there with six people and the entire meal was a disaster .	1	1
1	it 's not so bad , but it 's just not that good .	1	1
1	we only stayed one night and went back home .	1	1
1	hertz would not honor the reservation we had made over _num_ weeks ago .	1	1
1	i should 've known better .	1	1
1	i have been going here since november and today was horrible .	1	1
1	no interesting shops .	1	1
1	i wo n't be back .	1	1
1	worst pizza i have had in my entire _num_ years of life .	1	1
1	you wo n't find me at an olive garden back in new jersey !	1	1
1	fail .	1	1
1	this is unacceptable for any restaurant !	1	1
1	guy would n't stop talking to us .	1	1
1	i picked out the broccoli and ate it over my side of rice .	1	1
1	the vending machine for free samples was broken the last two times i went .	1	1
1	the kitchen does n't seem to care about customer service .	1	1
1	the one other time that i had been there the service was so-so .	1	1
1	you 've been warned .	1	1
1	guess what , no fresh oysters .	1	1
1	she said she did n't care and her manager did n't care .	1	1
1	oh but that 's not all folks .	1	1
1	i first ordered salmon sashimi and then got salmon nigiri instead .	1	1
1	the breadsticks are alway delish and hard to turn away eating more .	1	1
1	service was terrible !	1	1
1	the mongolian beef had a flavor but it was all wrong .	1	1
1	the pita bread was not pita , but large tortilla .	1	1
1	my bill came out to be higher than what 's listed on the menu .	1	1
1	within twenty minutes i started to have symptoms and was sick for two days .	1	1
1	not a fan of this `` german '' place .	1	1
1	i would give this place _num_ stars if i could .	1	1
1	how long should it take to make a grilled cheese ?	1	1
1	now i 'm unable to get the points on my reservation .	1	1
1	but that 's apparently the way they do it .	1	1
1	the cheesesteak was soggy .	1	1
1	it turns out this was a terrible idea .	1	1
1	for dessert , we shared a peanut butter pie with chocolate sauce .	1	1
1	just an all around poor experience and i will not be back .	1	1
1	too bad .	1	1
1	everyone else in my party said the same thing .	1	1
1	most of our bill was the wine .	1	1
1	the elevator moved really slow .	1	1
1	terrible customer service .	1	1
1	it 's why they have parking lots in the first place .	1	1
1	no stars would be correct .	1	1
1	i really did n't know what i was supposed to expect .	1	1
1	i then chose the cheese and peppers omelette , with egg whites .	1	1
1	good for a cheap lunch , but very americanized selection .	1	1
1	sorry i wo n't recommend .	1	1
1	no flavor .	1	1
1	they said that the meat was kind of tough and dry .	1	1
1	there were zero other people here aside from my friend and i .	1	1
1	below average and i will not return .	1	1
1	unfortunately i did not get to experience these things .	1	1
1	first go around - not too bad .	1	1
1	i generally love papa johns , but this one is lacking in all areas .	1	1
1	the wait time quote was an hour _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	seared ahi tuna sandwich - _num_ people in our group got this .	1	1
1	he did not agree that wifi for customers was a good idea .	1	1
1	i sent back the flatbread .	1	1
1	i am not interested in ever going back !	1	1
1	she added _num_ % gratuity , which was when we asked for a manager .	1	1
1	nothing special just around average !	1	1
1	way too much hype for such underwhelming food .	1	1
1	the worst .	1	1
1	i do n't regret it at all .	1	1
1	she offered no apology or solution .	1	1
1	after spending over $ _num_ plus games , we will never go back .	1	1
1	does n't this place know that every other rental place is more efficient ?	1	1
1	$ _num_ caesar salad with tasteless dressing that probably came out of a bottle .	1	1
1	the carpet feels so yucky but i did n't bring my flip flops .	1	1
1	my wife and i attempted to dine here yesterday and it went very badly .	1	1
1	they even screwed my order .	1	1
1	_num_ minutes .	1	1
1	upon entering it smelled of sewage and was very dark .	1	1
1	Neutral	1	1
1	so cold .	1	1
1	sorry that i did n't feel like waiting for three other customers .	1	1
1	it took _num_ minutes for our waitress to even come to our table !	1	1
1	the hotel is in a bad neighborhood .	1	1
1	but the biggest problem is the food and drink .	1	1
1	so much for trying to support local business .	1	1
1	so sad .	1	1
1	i got the beef , the chicken & cilantro and the spinach empanadas .	1	1
1	i had the kelly burger and it was just extremely massive and greasy .	1	1
1	the salad was nothing special .	1	1
1	made me feel uncomfortable , he was kinda nasty and condescending .	1	1
1	rest rooms are dirty , and smell of urine .	1	1
1	this airport is not family friendly .	1	1
1	for both sandwiches , the bread used was extremely bland and borderline stale .	1	1
1	and honestly there is nothing special here .	1	1
1	absolutely horrible way to treat a customer when they were the ones in error .	1	1
1	if you are in the aaa , you 'll know i 'm calling .	1	1
1	we tried bbq , garlic parmesan and spicy .	1	1
1	i 've been going to this bar randomly over the last _num_ years .	1	1
1	the quality is completely gone , portions are smaller , prices higher .	1	1
1	few times i was incorrectly charged and impossible to get corrected .	1	1
1	my whole experience here was unbelievable .	1	1
1	he literally spent _num_ minutes cutting my hair if that .	1	1
1	less than zero .	1	1
1	sides of hot baked potato and basic iceberg lettuce salad were fine .	1	1
1	waitress was not the best .	1	1
1	in fact , the menu is , to me , kinda boring .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	what a nightmare !	1	1
1	i 've already admitted it 's nothing special .	1	1
1	not once , have i had a reasonable answer to the hold up .	1	1
1	terrible pizza .	1	1
1	it 's $ _num_ ! ''	1	1
1	i 'm not sure why this place is rated _num_ stars .	1	1
1	the toast and hash browns were the only items cooked correctly .	1	1
1	she gave me an attitude .	1	1
1	instead , my total was about $ _num_ .	1	1
1	our food was cold .	1	1
1	the woman in charge was downright rude .	1	1
1	eventually i had enough and left , which they still probably did n't notice .	1	1
1	the creme brulee and flourless chocolate cake for desert were both amazing .	1	1
1	bad night ?	1	1
1	in my opinion , a waste of money .	1	1
1	my expectations would have been set and i just would have went somewhere else .	1	1
1	was served freezing cold enchiladas and pizza .	1	1
1	would not recommend .	1	1
1	woman at the front had a terrible attitude as soon as i walked on .	1	1
1	the gyro itself was mediocre .	1	1
1	it was very watery and bland : ( .	1	1
1	would give it _num_ stars if i could .	1	1
1	the salon is so dirty we left before i let them cut me hair .	1	1
1	as it is right now , do not patronize this business .	1	1
1	for shame !	1	1
1	however getting a quote and information from them was beyond frustrating !	1	1
1	it was hot in there and i do n't think they have ac .	1	1
1	i would not recommend this place .	1	1
1	why be in the service business if you have a bad attitude ?	1	1
1	other than that , it 's just a bunch of chains .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	very bad food and overpriced .	1	1
1	costco was closed so i went to giant eagle .	1	1
1	i was not the only patron who appeared to have trouble with their order .	1	1
1	stealing from your customers is not a great idea china buffet .	1	1
1	this was possibly the worst experience i have ever had as a parent .	1	1
1	when i said something to her about it , she snapped at me .	1	1
1	maybe i just had a bad day .	1	1
1	needless to say i am in the market for a new barber .	1	1
1	the duck breast was under done .	1	1
1	alas , customer service is poor .	1	1
1	for starters , the place is sorely outdated .	1	1
1	moo shu has plenty of cabbage , hardly any meat .	1	1
1	the other food was decent , but as i said before was cold .	1	1
1	she could n't believe that i said that .	1	1
1	and the quality of them are bad .	1	1
1	mediocre at best .	1	1
1	here 's where it gets bad .	1	1
1	safe to say , i was really upset and disappointed when i left .	1	1
1	my party and i left to go to another restaurant .	1	1
1	wifi costs _num_ bucks a night .	1	1
1	it was n't even that she said it .	1	1
1	i am paying almost _num_ bucks for this sub .	1	1
1	disgusting .	1	1
1	below par on every way .	1	1
1	and am not a fan of the _num_ % .	1	1
1	under no circumstances should you sit down before placing an order .	1	1
1	the salad was n't good .	1	1
1	this showmars used to be awesome .	1	1
1	ugh .	1	1
1	horrible people .	1	1
1	not much else to say .	1	1
1	service was just barely adequate on this visit .	1	1
1	i wo n't be ordering from ron 's again , despite the inexpensive menu .	1	1
1	the prices on the menu do n't seem that bad .	1	1
1	is it worth the $ _num_ cover on fridays ?	1	1
1	not good .	1	1
1	not our best ihop experience .	1	1
1	i do n't think that casbah is my favorite anymore .	1	1
1	the service in this store is ridiculous .	1	1
1	wait which i left to run some errands .	1	1
1	this place is just a flat out joke .	1	1
1	i will not purchase with this company .	1	1
1	when the food finally came it was bad .	1	1
1	this place was garbage for hookah .	1	1
1	not even one piece .	1	1
1	horrible !	1	1
1	my main issue is that i did not receive what i paid for .	1	1
1	i guess i will now wait another _num_ weeks to get this problem solved .	1	1
1	crispy on the outside , creamy and cheesy on the inside .	1	1
1	then to top it off the remote does n't even work for the tv .	1	1
1	waiting outside our doors at _num_ am to get out when checkout is _num_ .	1	1
1	i dunno - just not that great and i wo n't go back .	1	1
1	this time it was runny bland mushy rice with extra mushy veggies .	1	1
1	not an option .	1	1
1	also my veggies were n't seasoned at all and were not even steamed .	1	1
1	total mess .	1	1
1	if you ever have a problem you are seriously sol .	1	1
1	our waiter was friendly , he came to refill our waters twice .	1	1
1	i 've had a lot of bad experiences at this store .	1	1
1	they tried to get me to upgrade twice .	1	1
1	slightly better than starbucks , but that 's not saying much .	1	1
1	worst bar i have ever been to .	1	1
1	i am not a fan .	1	1
1	tasted nothing like a carolina burger should .	1	1
1	not at all like other bojangles i have visited .	1	1
1	tried to purchase some dj equipment from this company .	1	1
1	very rude and unprofessional , do n't go there !	1	1
1	and no thanks or nothing .	1	1
1	i do n't want anyone else to go through this .	1	1
1	if your seeking genuine medical attention i would strongly suggest another facility .	1	1
1	there are much better chinese restaurants in madison and they are cheaper !	1	1
1	my boyfriend ordered the pork rice vermicelli bowl .	1	1
1	food was excellent but we hated the ambiance !	1	1
1	the entire staff was rude .	1	1
1	i would n't go back , that 's for sure .	1	1
1	the pizza now is just ok .	1	1
1	bbq shrimp were fine .	1	1
1	we will not be coming back again .	1	1
1	get your wallet ready , the prices are crazy high !	1	1
1	then i made the bold , yet stupid decision to dine here again .	1	1
1	quite frankly , the fish was n't good at all .	1	1
1	the quality of the clothing was pathetic and most of the items were ugly .	1	1
1	she never even gave us silverware or napkins .	1	1
1	oh and less than stellar fries , with a cup of cole slaw .	1	1
1	the sauce they were drowning in seemed to have almost a chemical taste .	1	1
1	they put oil on the sandwich , but no other dressing .	1	1
1	the rice was plain , edible with soy sauce .	1	1
1	poor little guy .	1	1
1	sorry , i gotten very used to no smoking i public places in pittsburgh .	1	1
1	the next morning we tried to leave and it was nearly impossible .	1	1
1	and this is n't even the halfway point to philly .	1	1
1	a few of us went out after late night bowling to get some food .	1	1
1	chef ramsey , where are you when we need you ?	1	1
1	i have n't felt this ripped off in a very long time .	1	1
1	if i asked the price , she did n't know and did n't look .	1	1
1	great location but the facilities are a little tired .	1	1
1	tables were n't clean .	1	1
1	rude and unprofessional !	1	1
1	this is not italian food - it 's pittsburgh italian food .	1	1
1	okay on to service ... everyone seemed like they hated their job .	1	1
1	not even close .	1	1
1	this is an odd little cvs .	1	1
1	the place was shabby and the floor was filthy .	1	1
1	( _num_ ) left messages and no one called me back .	1	1
1	hallways and rooms were dim , though the beds were comfortable .	1	1
1	disgusting & totally unsanitary imo .	1	1
1	worst strip club i 've ever been to .	1	1
1	my hoagie was dry with min meat .	1	1
1	this place is far too expensive to be serving food poorly prepared .	1	1
1	bathroom was not up to par to the price of the room .	1	1
1	super bad energy in this place .	1	1
1	not sure what happened to this restaurant but it has seriously gone down hill .	1	1
1	this is where i get a serious case of the sad .	1	1
1	there was no aroma from garlic or onion .	1	1
1	extremely rude lady works there on sundays .	1	1
1	trying to get the check out of her was terrible .	1	1
1	in my opinion they could not possibly be legit recommendations .	1	1
1	the hallway looks a wreck !	1	1
1	my bf got the steak with battered shrimp .	1	1
1	chicken was dry and the portions were tiny !	1	1
1	he said the stir fry was so-so .	1	1
1	it just looks trashy .	1	1
1	all in all an extreme disappointment .	1	1
1	it was very crowded due to little italy days in bloomfield .	1	1
1	but that should be explained by the waitstaff when someone orders the meal !	1	1
1	we never got asked if we needed anything else and received no water refill .	1	1
1	we will not be back .	1	1
1	it was way too thick and absolutely tasteless .	1	1
1	i only went here because i had a groupon .	1	1
1	the food here used to be good now it 's trash .	1	1
1	the locker room was ridiculously crowded ( too small ) .	1	1
1	my first try was with the meatballs and pasta .	1	1
1	we greeted her before she greeted us which i find rude .	1	1
1	i did n't care .	1	1
1	_num_ . )	1	1
1	slow .	1	1
1	weird experience .	1	1
1	do not recommend at all .	1	1
1	disgusting , slow and pathetic .	1	1
1	avoid !	1	1
1	both plates were mediocre at best .	1	1
1	checkin was seamless as it should be .	1	1
1	_num_ after tip .	1	1
1	the cheese is what i imagine fake , fake cheese is like .	1	1
1	he said , `` we only have _num_ .	1	1
1	for everyone that gave this place more than one star .	1	1
1	our server screwed up both our orders , would n't recommend to anyone .	1	1
1	i am sorry to say i did not get it .	1	1
1	located in not such a great part of town .	1	1
1	it turned out mostly mediocre .	1	1
1	i was very disappointed .	1	1
1	we hardly could eat anything and left everything like that .	1	1
1	extremely disappointed .	1	1
1	thought i would give it another shot after a previous bad experience .	1	1
1	add that to the place , the staff , the price - go elsewhere .	1	1
1	pathetic !	1	1
1	horrible service and food was bland .	1	1
1	had the gyro and added feta .	1	1
1	the pad thai itself was really disappointing .	1	1
1	no bueno .	1	1
1	so she then tried to help things along .	1	1
1	the worst walgreens in the history of walgreens .	1	1
1	you just get in your car and drive .	1	1
1	often answers the orders totally lacks something .	1	1
1	was n't worth it for me .	1	1
1	the entire bag was a soggy mess .	1	1
1	save yourself the frustration !	1	1
1	we stayed a week for a conference .	1	1
1	therefore they installer never made it to my apartment .	1	1
1	started with the bathrooms ... rarely cleaned , rarely working .	1	1
1	that is the prime reason why i would not recommend this restaurant to anyone .	1	1
1	i 'm still never setting foot in there ever again .	1	1
1	as an exception to other thai restaurants , attendant lady was courteous .	1	1
1	also had to dodge many foul balls .	1	1
1	this location was kind of busy .	1	1
1	i have experienced poor customer service and shady salespeople .	1	1
1	literally , anywhere .	1	1
1	she was having a hard time finding my order .	1	1
1	that does n't say too much for the rest of them .	1	1
1	sadly , i was disappointed .	1	1
1	i see why this restaurant is rated so poorly .	1	1
1	i had _num_ pieces of pepperoni on an entire large pizza .	1	1
1	cheap bar food .	1	1
1	i had carryout .	1	1
1	no upgrades .	1	1
1	there was no flavor at all .	1	1
1	i booked this hotel stay for a business ( military ) event .	1	1
1	$ _num_ ?	1	1
1	never received my order and was left in a bad mood .	1	1
1	their food is pretty much like their beers , forgettable .	1	1
1	we were next to the kitchen and it was really loud .	1	1
1	another couple ordered the cajun pasta and brewery beef tips .	1	1
1	needless to say , we will never return !	1	1
1	as diners we would like prompt service and attention but this was not good .	1	1
1	how does this place still exist of every place on the waterfront !	1	1
1	very average , pita was a bit dry .	1	1
1	however , we ordered the veal stuffed banana peppers which arrived cold .	1	1
1	we both left full but totally unsatisfied .	1	1
1	the side of vegetables were well cooked , buy again lacked any real flavor .	1	1
1	this makes me sad to write this .	1	1
1	another appointment was setup , and yet again no call and no show .	1	1
1	this location is n't consistent .	1	1
1	the manager jackie was extremely rude !	1	1
1	check out the better business bureau ( bbb ) .	1	1
1	i ordered chicken curry .	1	1
1	i wo n't return there .	1	1
1	we called about the issue and they sent someone over right away .	1	1
1	after that no real food in the entire e concourse .	1	1
1	it was very difficult to get our server 's attention throughout the evening .	1	1
1	slow slow slow and slow !	1	1
1	i am considering switching airlines so i no longer have to connect through clt .	1	1
1	super disappointed in this place .	1	1
1	there is only one small public restroom and no organization to the layout .	1	1
1	unfortunately rock bottom is one that falls into that category .	1	1
1	all tasted like old food .	1	1
1	just an awful airport that needs to get back into the 19th century .	1	1
1	it is essentially just fast food in a sit down restaurant .	1	1
1	this crust , while thin , did not have flavor and was hard .	1	1
1	days old , cold , hard , inedible .	1	1
1	the beet salad was underwhelming .	1	1
1	do n't say i did n't tell you so .	1	1
1	it was just meh .	1	1
1	and my husbands roasted chicken was frozen in the inside but cooked through ?	1	1
1	but not $ _num_ for _num_ standard size dog good .	1	1
1	i walked around .	1	1
1	so i left .	1	1
1	would n't go back .	1	1
1	seriously though , their food is so bad .	1	1
1	something happened and the wings are small dry and just generally bad .	1	1
1	my only regret is i can not leave a 1/2 star rating .	1	1
1	not a great selection of food .	1	1
1	i ate here for lunch today with my wife and _num_ kids .	1	1
1	the food is n't fresh .	1	1
1	and they looked at me like i had _num_ heads .	1	1
1	first thing i noticed is the place was an absolute sauna .	1	1
1	both of these dishes were extremely unappealing as well .	1	1
1	i would recommend the lunch specials such as the hunan shrimp .	1	1
1	almost appeared to be an inconvenience for her to wait on us .	1	1
1	too slow service .	1	1
1	however , the customer service lacks excellence and the wifi is completely unreliable .	1	1
1	please avoid this place .	1	1
1	lines are short and fast because the place is near empty .	1	1
1	the fries on the sandwich added no additional flavor .	1	1
1	he said , `` thanks for the feedback , '' then he left .	1	1
1	the new tuna tartare appetizer was the highlight of our night .	1	1
1	when we first got in , there was nobody at the hostess station .	1	1
1	shame on you lincoln to run a bakery like this .	1	1
1	i would not recommend to visit second time .	1	1
1	it rather looks like a deli counter .	1	1
1	never , ever use these incompetent people for property management .	1	1
1	their food was mediocre at best .	1	1
1	just like other yucky american chinese restaurant now !	1	1
1	i made reservations for _num_ pm on a friday .	1	1
1	it was just all around bland .	1	1
1	instead and skip this place .	1	1
1	i will not eat there again .	1	1
1	and others as well.	1	1
1	wireless connection at this place is horrible .	1	1
1	worse than cans .	1	1
1	the service is terrible .	1	1
1	i waited another _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	after _num_ years i 'd hoped they would have improved but i was wrong .	1	1
1	one table near us had to flag a waitress just to get her attention .	1	1
1	it was a crowded mess .	1	1
1	avoid this place at all costs .	1	1
1	i would n't go there again .	1	1
1	the servers are polite , but extremely inattentive .	1	1
1	the sandwiches they serve are gross !	1	1
1	i really want to love this restaurant but i really do n't .	1	1
1	biggest peeve is grass not kept .	1	1
1	the response and reaction that i got from her receptionist was quite rude .	1	1
1	their vehicles are dirty and smelly .	1	1
1	tables are often dirty .	1	1
1	this was our first time trying this place since moving to castle shannon .	1	1
1	we wo n't be stopping back to celebrate at this location again .	1	1
1	big disappointment on that dish .	1	1
1	i spent an average of $ _num_ per month on cleaning .	1	1
1	as we get our 2nd batch of sushi our soup was still not ready .	1	1
1	it was clear servicing customers was an inconvenience to him .	1	1
1	ruined our panthers football game !	1	1
1	the flatbread pizza most likely came out of the box .	1	1
1	just do n't go hungry if you actually have tastebuds .	1	1
1	i feel dirty just being here .	1	1
1	i really really want this place to do better .	1	1
1	for starters i got the mozzarella basil tomato salad .	1	1
1	ended up with _num_ meals un eaten .	1	1
1	really disappointing .	1	1
1	however , there are better places to dine within the southpark area .	1	1
1	every interaction seems designed to make people feel awkward .	1	1
1	the dough , sauce , cheese ... even the pepperoni was bland .	1	1
1	poor customer service .	1	1
1	gross , gross , gross .	1	1
1	our food waited so long the lettuce & pickles wilted .	1	1
1	the whole thing was frustrating to say the least .	1	1
1	the worst customer service ever !	1	1
1	it 's all cheap but that 's not reason to be terrible .	1	1
1	was the worst i have ever had .	1	1
1	i guess this nightmare will never be over .	1	1
1	way too salty , cheese tasted like crap .	1	1
1	( this becomes important later . )	1	1
1	never have i ever actually left a restaurant and not left a tip .	1	1
1	unfortunately , i did not have the great experience others did .	1	1
1	i 've filled tires 2x since so i asked them to check on tires .	1	1
1	service gets _num_ stars and food gets _num_ stars .	1	1
1	the red velvet pancakes were chocolate pancakes with red food dye added into them .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	my husband and i went to mert 's on sunday morning around _num_ .	1	1
1	after being seated , it took our waiter forever to come to our table .	1	1
1	this guy looks like he did n't know what he was doing .	1	1
1	i would not stay here again .	1	1
1	they gave me a nice receipt .	1	1
1	no apologies for uncooked food !	1	1
1	sorry , but our pizza was cold .	1	1
1	i settled for the beef tenderloin and fried calamari appetizer .	1	1
1	if not for this , i 'd have talked to the manager .	1	1
1	else , you will find better value and experience elsewhere .	1	1
1	i could not put another bite in my mouth .	1	1
1	their screen setup could be awesome , except they are n't hd .	1	1
1	very pricy , poor service and no contact dance .	1	1
1	my salad had a rotten tomato and a hair ( not mine ) .	1	1
1	person behind counter was apathetic and did not seem surprised at all .	1	1
1	i ordered the pasta trio , and my husband ordered the risotto .	1	1
1	if you want rock bottom food , head to rock bottom .	1	1
1	a white , boring , incredibly small plate .	1	1
1	general tso had no flavor .	1	1
1	but i really would n't recommend going there .	1	1
1	i waited _num_ minutes for the right car .	1	1
1	i could n't finish it .	1	1
1	the damage was done .	1	1
1	my family ordered the bacon burger , chicken fingers , and a greek wrap .	1	1
1	the main courses are extremely overpriced ( not unusual for walnut st. ) .	1	1
1	guess that 's worth _num_ stars eh ?	1	1
1	wrong !	1	1
1	described as being served with butternut squash , brussel sprouts and cauliflower .	1	1
1	if i could give mimosa grill `` _num_ '' stars , i would .	1	1
1	one exception -- the ribs are not bad and edible !	1	1
1	do n't waste your time or money .	1	1
1	i could n't even eat them .	1	1
1	terrible food .	1	1
1	guess the men at olive or twist only like men .	1	1
1	not here .	1	1
1	so i had to wait an additional _num_ minutes to find someone to pay .	1	1
1	the burger is dry and lacks flavor .	1	1
1	very lackluster .	1	1
1	first , our waitress was not well informed of the offerings that evening .	1	1
1	that pissed me right off .	1	1
1	overall they get a d for food and an a for ambience and location .	1	1
1	no one came to check the unit for mold .	1	1
1	ridiculous .	1	1
1	we were visiting friends in charlotte and chose macaroni grill to meet .	1	1
1	the bread was cold and tasteless .	1	1
1	it pains me to leave any tip for them .	1	1
1	plus , cold rude staff .	1	1
1	i wish we had video cameras to record the absurd service we received .	1	1
1	you can guarantee i will never step foot in this place again .	1	1
1	based on this experience , i would not go back .	1	1
1	i 'm not wasting my calories on a bad cookie .	1	1
1	i never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be .	1	1
1	the advertised prices were _num_ .	1	1
1	horrible !	1	1
1	my mom ordered the mushroom ravioli , which was completely bland .	1	1
1	finally , after my pushing , she looked it up on my file .	1	1
1	needless to say , i will not be going back to this place .	1	1
1	so painful !	1	1
1	they are so slow and are not any help .	1	1
1	tram 's kitchen in my opinion is not really worth it .	1	1
1	i think the food is boring .	1	1
1	was not impressed then .	1	1
1	Neutral	1	1
1	i waited _num_ minutes and finally walked out .	1	1
1	we are never going back .	1	1
1	food was mediocre at best , place seems kind of dirty .	1	1
1	i do n't know that i 'll recommend my guests here any more .	1	1
1	worst service of all time .	1	1
1	when we walked in , no one greeted us or even looked at us .	1	1
1	reason i book reservation is to have enough seats ahead of time .	1	1
1	just want people to understand truth in advertising .	1	1
1	but let me tell you , i was highly disappointed .	1	1
1	i will never visit this location again and will also write outback personally .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	by far the worst service we 've had in a while .	1	1
1	also they were not that tender .	1	1
1	i walked in _num_ girls stood behind the counter not one offered to help .	1	1
1	i just went for dinner and ordered the honey mustard glazed salmon .	1	1
1	fast forward to july ( _num_ weeks before the wedding ) .	1	1
1	sticky floors , bad smell , just general lack of housekeeping .	1	1
1	not nearly impossible , literally impossible .	1	1
1	just about half the price of the `` promotion '' the representative offered me .	1	1
1	there was absolutely no care or thought put into this salad .	1	1
1	the location , however , is stellar .	1	1
1	we have been ordering food from little tokyo for almost _num_ years now .	1	1
1	the beer is cheap .	1	1
1	the menu changes are n't necessarily better .	1	1
1	this is the worst chinese food i have had in a long time .	1	1
1	the guy who processed our registration was patronizing and slow .	1	1
1	not worth it at all .	1	1
1	i order sesame chicken with shrimp fried rice and it was awful !	1	1
1	disgusting .	1	1
1	worst airport for food i have ever been in , especially on the morning .	1	1
1	this time especially , my room did n't seem as clean as it should .	1	1
1	butter served with the bread was so hard it bent the knife .	1	1
1	do n't waste your time at the fish market .	1	1
1	confused !	1	1
1	i had the worst lunch of all times here today .	1	1
1	i will not be a repeat patron .	1	1
1	i just did n't feel welcomed .	1	1
1	i am a ten minute drive from this location .	1	1
1	he started off by saying `` just _num_ '' .	1	1
1	this was my first time here and i will never go back .	1	1
1	even the guacamole was too hot .	1	1
1	both walmart and sam 's club need to learn valuable customer service .	1	1
1	so , obviously will not be staying there on future visits to charlotte .	1	1
1	i do n't like being lied to .	1	1
1	very rude and the managers seem to treat their employees with no respect .	1	1
1	nope , wo n't be back .	1	1
1	not very appetizing .	1	1
1	this was quite honestly my worst experience ever at a tgi fridays .	1	1
1	wo n't be back for dinner .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	slowest server i have ever had .	1	1
1	these books were needed last friday for a class that meets on mondays .	1	1

1	this is not the place to stay for a weekend get away .	1	1
1	their chicken is better too .	1	1
1	the chicken was tasteless and rubbery .	1	1
1	please do not adopt any pets from here until they update their standards .	1	1
1	panda is doing better then this .	1	1
1	i will never go back to that place again .	1	1
1	the prime rib was fatty and cold .	1	1
1	anyway , that 's not even why i 'm upset .	1	1
1	the frozen carmel coffee drink was much better than fruit smoothie .	1	1
1	thank god there were bottles of hot sauce and salt on the table .	1	1
1	then told me it probably did n't start because it was sitting so long .	1	1
1	these women are old middle aged miserable employees with no passion for their jobs .	1	1
1	i even cut up my gold membership card already .	1	1
1	if i could give them zero stars , i would .	1	1
1	disgusting .	1	1
1	worst experience of my life and nothing made it better .	1	1

1	cool sports bar , pool tables and ample flat screens .	1	1
1	the asparagus was more shaved and less than one full piece .	1	1
1	i am never going back to this place .	1	1
1	quality of food was not at all what was expected for the price .	1	1
1	especially when the one cashier is sooooooo slow .	1	1

1	this is piss poor excuse for a turkish restaurant .	1	1
1	i ate about a third of it and threw the rest away .	1	1
1	this place is the worst motel i have ever stayed .	1	1
1	if that does n't work , then they try to scare you w/ it .	1	1
1	save your money , this place does n't deserve to be named ruth chris .	1	1
1	the owners should be ashamed .	1	1
1	the manager nowhere to be seen .	1	1
1	i can not believe how unprofessional this store was !	1	1
1	my other issue is their restaurants are all filthy .	1	1
1	wow ... we 're we disappointed .	1	1
1	came in for drinks after a conference and could not get service .	1	1
1	i have nothing good to say about this place .	1	1
1	i sent in a photo order online ( same day prints ) .	1	1
1	there was a smell as soon as i walked in the room .	1	1
1	waste of a cheat meal .	1	1
1	it 's dirty and weird .	1	1
1	i walk in , look around , look at the menu ... hmmm .	1	1
1	ugh if i could give this place _num_ stars i would .	1	1

1	one of the floors that does does not offer drinks .	1	1

1	um , probably not .	1	1
1	he was diligent and never had a problem for _num_ years .	1	1
1	the waitress was really nice , i think her name was sarah .	1	1
1	for a coffee shop , the food and drinks here are mediocre at best .	1	1
1	what a disappointment , the risotto balls were very bland and gummy .	1	1
1	there is such a thing as food too fast .	1	1
1	- mushroom pasta : again quite rich and salty .	1	1
1	my husband was excited about the amount of beers they had on tap .	1	1
1	when we arrived there , however it was a different story .	1	1
1	pesto gnocchi okay , tiramisu okay ( except for the canned whipped cream ) .	1	1
1	for location this place is a _num_ star .	1	1
1	wondered into this place looking for some mixed drinks .	1	1
1	when i say they messed up one of our pants , they destroyed it .	1	1
1	for the main course , i selected the gnocchi and grilled sausage .	1	1
1	deciding not to get it , i placed it on a near by shelf .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	there are much better sushi choices available .	1	1
1	she again left for another _num_ minutes .	1	1
1	i do n't know why this chef would completely change the perfected dish .	1	1
1	they do not take american express as a side note .	1	1
1	there were nine people in the bar section .	1	1
1	if i could give less than one star , i would .	1	1
1	waiting to see if they would bring any new food out ... but nope .	1	1
1	just another chain food restaurant .	1	1
1	but food and drinks were disappointing .	1	1
1	the lack of empathy was even more disturbing .	1	1
1	all the tables around us came , ate and left .	1	1
1	this made me question whether or not she was professionally trained .	1	1
1	do not waste your money here .	1	1
1	food is n't that great .	1	1
1	i should know , i 've dealt with at least a dozen .	1	1
1	it was a disaster .	1	1
1	_num_ .	1	1
1	i made the mistake of sending mine back .	1	1
1	given this place too many opportunities and they constantly fail .	1	1
1	seriously i wished i would have wasted more time there .	1	1
1	this place is a nightmare .	1	1
1	)	1	1

1	on of the worst chinese buffets i 've seen .	1	1
1	i called room service , and they never brought them up .	1	1
1	with all of the other options in the area , take your money elsewhere !	1	1
1	this is the worst place i 've ever stayed in my life .	1	1

1	but it 's not old , either .	1	1
1	they gave us a $ _num_ gift card to make up for it .	1	1

1	paper ripped or shredded , give it to them anyway .	1	1
1	wo n't even let you float on your back .	1	1
1	i 'm sure you can find better accommodations in this price range and location .	1	1
1	probably not .	1	1
1	had this pizza been cooked , i feel like it would be subpar .	1	1
1	is this your corporate policy or just an issue with your provider ?	1	1
1	by 6:30 , there were still a number of empty tables .	1	1
1	after reading reviews i was afraid of what kind of service we would encounter .	1	1
1	they both looked old and one of them smelled old .	1	1
1	this place has really gone down hill in the past 3-4 years .	1	1
1	it 's sometimes tough to get waited on even with nobody in the store .	1	1
